## Motivation

[CrossPolitic](https://crosspolitic.com/) is a podcast that I sometimes listen to.  They switched their podcast feed to be a master feed of the whole "Fight Laugh Feast Network".  Now they have about a dozen podcasts all dumping into one enormous podcast feed.  It's overwhelming, and I don't like going through and whittling down the feed to just the series that I want to listen to.

So I made this feed splitter, which will divide the master podcast feed into many smaller podcast feeds.
