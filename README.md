## Motivation

[CrossPolitic](https://crosspolitic.com/) is a podcast that I sometimes listen to.  They switched their podcast feed to be a master feed of the whole "Fight Laugh Feast Network".  Now they have about a dozen podcasts all dumping into one enormous podcast feed.  It's overwhelming, and I don't like going through and whittling down the feed to just the series that I want to listen to.

So I made this feed splitter, which will divide the master podcast feed into many smaller podcast feeds.

Then paste the link into your podcast player.  If you need help with this step, see this article: [How do you manually add a podcast feed to iOS and Android](https://transistor.fm/add-podcast/)
