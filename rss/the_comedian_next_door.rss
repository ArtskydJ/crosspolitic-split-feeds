   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor!&nbsp; John Branyan and the Peaches are hanging out with their friend, Bob Smiley.&nbsp; He just likes to spend time with us, and he's not going to talk about his website or his new book or his tour dates... etc...</p>
<p>Bob recently shared a meme on Facebook that was shared more than 700 times, but not everyone liked the message.&nbsp; (Christians can be so hateful, you know?) John and Amanda know what it's like to upset both the unbelievers AND the "nice" Christians at the same time! Listen in to their conversation here!<br /><br />Contact the Comedian Next Door by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>.&nbsp; You can contact Bob by visiting his website, bobsmiley.com.&nbsp; But, remember, it's not about Bob.</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Part 2, Road Trip with the Comedian (Men Take Responsibility) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, Neighbor! This is Part 2 of the Car Conversation, while John Branyan travels with The Peaches down to southern Indiana for a show.<br /><br />Have you read Prince Caspian by C.S. Lewis?&nbsp; That story provides a great analogy for how a High King needs to behave when it's time to take responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then--a Feminist author, Sheila Wray Gregoire, shared an old video clip from the original Candid Camera show.&nbsp; "Who says girls and women aren't visual creatures?!?!"&nbsp; (Answer: Um, nobody.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young ladies are making eyes at their handsome new teacher, and it's all caught on film.&nbsp; But why do the Feminists think this is helping their case at all?&nbsp; Those girls are <em>precisely </em>the ones who need to be told not to dress provocatively just to get the teacher's attention.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later: These women clearly need to be disciplined (not whatever they have in mind when claiming "She Deserves Better").&nbsp; But who's supposed to do the disciplining?&nbsp; Who has authority over them?&nbsp; The Peaches make the case that perhaps this is a MOTHERHOOD crisis and not a Fatherhood one.&nbsp; Perhaps it's the mature WOMEN who are supposed to tell these little girls-in-grown-bodies that they're embarassing us and giving womanhood a bad name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But...women are being taught to use "Gentle Parenting" techniques with their toddlers. So there's a lack of confidence in authoritative discipleship...</p>
<p>Finally:&nbsp; What's going to happen in the next 20 years, when 5th-Wave Feminism has completely "liberated" women from all morality?&nbsp; &nbsp;When Modesty is a derogatory term, and it's hate speech to say women are sinners, too...then what will the big crusade be against? <br /><br />They probably will wage war against all references to Jesus Himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact the Comedian by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Also, come on vacation with The Comedian and his funny friends/family. Registrations closes soon! Get the details about Vacay with Comics on johnbranyan.com before it's too late!&nbsp;</p>]]></description>
