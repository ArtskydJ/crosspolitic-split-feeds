   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, Neighbor! This is Part 2 of the Car Conversation, while John Branyan travels with The Peaches down to southern Indiana for a show.<br /><br />Have you read Prince Caspian by C.S. Lewis?&nbsp; That story provides a great analogy for how a High King needs to behave when it's time to take responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then--a Feminist author, Sheila Wray Gregoire, shared an old video clip from the original Candid Camera show.&nbsp; "Who says girls and women aren't visual creatures?!?!"&nbsp; (Answer: Um, nobody.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young ladies are making eyes at their handsome new teacher, and it's all caught on film.&nbsp; But why do the Feminists think this is helping their case at all?&nbsp; Those girls are <em>precisely </em>the ones who need to be told not to dress provocatively just to get the teacher's attention.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later: These women clearly need to be disciplined (not whatever they have in mind when claiming "She Deserves Better").&nbsp; But who's supposed to do the disciplining?&nbsp; Who has authority over them?&nbsp; The Peaches make the case that perhaps this is a MOTHERHOOD crisis and not a Fatherhood one.&nbsp; Perhaps it's the mature WOMEN who are supposed to tell these little girls-in-grown-bodies that they're embarassing us and giving womanhood a bad name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But...women are being taught to use "Gentle Parenting" techniques with their toddlers. So there's a lack of confidence in authoritative discipleship...</p>
<p>Finally:&nbsp; What's going to happen in the next 20 years, when 5th-Wave Feminism has completely "liberated" women from all morality?&nbsp; &nbsp;When Modesty is a derogatory term, and it's hate speech to say women are sinners, too...then what will the big crusade be against? <br /><br />They probably will wage war against all references to Jesus Himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact the Comedian by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Also, come on vacation with The Comedian and his funny friends/family. Registrations closes soon! Get the details about Vacay with Comics on johnbranyan.com before it's too late!&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Part 1 Road Trip with The Comedian (Agreeable/Disagreeable Women) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/85a5ed56-f3a9-40bc-b320-5c9f85d173d3/tcnd-road-trip-with-the-comedian-agreeabledisagreeable-women.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Comedian and the Peaches are in the car, taking a trip to southern Indiana.&nbsp; Come along for the ride!&nbsp; (Our GPS made the recorder glitch between the 13:00 and 14:00 minute mark... But it cleared up after that.) <br /><br />We'll kick it off with a riveting conversation about the benefits of being short--and the disorienting effect of new eye-glasses...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Then, let's talk about the evolving role of a mother as her children grow in maturity. She has to be able to shift from "agreeableness" to a more "disagreeable" framework.&nbsp; What are the strengths and weaknesses of Agreeable/Disagreeable People?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically women are more "agreeable," because they are equipped to deal with infants--who are very needy and dependent and can't be held to a higher standard until they've grown.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's easier to be the least mature person in a very mature system than to be the most mature person in a very immature system.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone wants to be the Baby of a very stable family--and no one wants to be the Manager of a whole bunch of babies!</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; We have more to say about Sheila Wray Gregoire, who released a book this week called "She Deserves Better."&nbsp; &nbsp; Why are so many Evangelical MEN afraid to call out these Feminists?&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, short version: they are hesitant for the same reason many women/moms don't want to discipline their own kids.&nbsp; (It feels Too Authoritative.)</p>
<p>Books like "She Deserves Better" is creating perpetually immature women...girls who use their tears to get what they want. And, ironically, her whole strategy depends on men playing the role of Mommies who take care of these Baby Girls.&nbsp;<br /><br />Women have a big challenge in raising their children:&nbsp; constantly growing WITH them.&nbsp; "How do we know when it's time to comfort them and when it's time to challenge them?!"&nbsp; &nbsp;That's a very good question.&nbsp; And, just when we start to get a routine that seems to work for everyone, it's time for a growth spurt.&nbsp; When you try to sell a cookie-cutter message to EVERY girl/woman in the church, you are trying to sell a silver bullet formula that won't work for most girls/women.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally:&nbsp; Being empowered means having responsibility. If you have power, you are capable of abusing it.&nbsp; But no one is warning these women about how to use their power, once it's given to them...&nbsp; &nbsp;Which is a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />-PITSTOP-<br /><br />You can reach out to the Comedian, John Branyan, by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com .</a></p>]]></description>
