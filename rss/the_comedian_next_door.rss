   <title><![CDATA[TCND: More Creation Talk (Do the Dishes, Men!) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor! We want to apologize for the quality of our last episode.&nbsp; It was actually a GREAT conversation, if you were able to decipher it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, let's talk a little more about creation!&nbsp; &nbsp;In essentials, unity. In opinions, liberty. And in everything, love.&nbsp;<br /><br />That's all well and good, isn't it?&nbsp; But WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIALS?&nbsp;<br /><br />Most Christians don't care (on the surface) how old the earth is... but we DO care about making sure our kids understand "the essentials."&nbsp; So, if we're being told we MUST read Genesis a particular way in order to raise Christian kids, that will pique our interest.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most mothers are willing to write "24-hours" into their Bibles, if that's what it takes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are concerned with what affects their DAILY LIFE.&nbsp; In general, they're not impacted by whether God used millions of years to prepare the earth for humans, except that they're being told their kids will leave the faith if they DON'T teach Young Earth Creationism.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later:&nbsp; A Good Man Will Do the Dishes!!!&nbsp; (Listen as we explain why Michael Foster is way more interesting than Ken Ham.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be some Christians in reformed circles who are tired of talking about marriage, parenting, and other "basics." But we can't get tired of doing good! There are still many, many, many, many self-identified Christians who haven't learned how to LIVE like Christians, yet. Most of the moms in our home church are still sending their kids to public schools.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many are not even getting married and staying married. Many are still blaming their husbands (who fail to do the dishes) for their unhappiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to theology and growing in their walk with Christ--affirming that creation was accomplished in 24-hour days is not even a blip on the radar.&nbsp;</p>
