   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Fight with the Comedian (A Bite of Hotdog) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're ready for our ratings to SOAR now that we're incorporating some FIGHTING. Jump into the boxing ring with us today, Neighbor!</p>
<p>Send us an email to let us know if you need some more controversy, or if you want us to drum up some more "Brain Candy" for your listening pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>People don't like to think of themselves as antagonistic...&nbsp; &nbsp;But, once they decide that someone else "deserves it," for any reason, then all bets are off.&nbsp; They get to be antagonistic without counting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John was accused of "stirring the pot" this week. That's not a Fruit of the Spirit, you know? Let's not talk about controversial stuff, because that's more Christlike.</p>
<p>But, what if: Controversy is the rich soil from which relationships grow?&nbsp; People don't want poop on their relationships...but they need to trust the fertilizing process!</p>
<p>Later: John shares a meme involving an octopus--(i.e. the 8-legged mammals of the sea)--which helps prove once again that Neurodiversity is a fancy word for "spends too much time on the internet."&nbsp; We really need to stop helping people hyperfocus on what they can't do. It's normal to be bad at things.&nbsp; It's NOT normal to expect the entire school system to cater to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We talk a little bit about ADHD meds...</p>
<p>And, finally:&nbsp; &nbsp; 5-year-old Silas hops on the mic for just a second.&nbsp; And this prompts the Peaches to share two stories from Parenting World.</p>
<p>Contact the Comedian Next Door at <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com/</a></p>
<p>We hope you've enjoyed this dramatic brawl!</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Don't Take Marriage Advice from Jimmy (Papa John) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor! Give us a second to plug in Luke's mic...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we're talking about popular Relationship Gurus on TikTok--specifically "Jimmy on Relationships," who has amassed a huge following from Divorced (or soon-to-be-divorced) women.&nbsp; What does it take to become a popular content creator "on relationships"?</p>
<p>Well, start by having an affair...</p>
<p>Then buy yourself a wig...</p>
<p>Once again, these videos are being share by PROFESSING CHRISTIANS who lack discernment.&nbsp; Why are Church People struggling to sort out the difference between worldly advice and good biblical Wisdom?</p>
<p>Later: John played a Jimmy Video for his men's group, and nobody thought it was important. They'd rather lament the existence of technology than talk about leading their family members who are watching Jimmy Videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact the Comedian by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com .</a></p>
<p>We'll see you at the Fight Laugh Feast Conference next month!!!</p>]]></description>
