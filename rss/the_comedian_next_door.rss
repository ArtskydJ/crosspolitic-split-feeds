   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, Neighbor! You're jumping into this conversation that's already underway between the Comedian Next Door (John Branyan) and his good buddy, Juan DeVevo. (It's okay. Just pull up a chair and make yourself comfortable. They'll make room for you.)&nbsp; If you'd like to hear Part 1, go back to last week's episode!</p>
<p>Juan often drops by the Comedian's house to chat about the cultural things on his mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a good person? What does Christian living look like?&nbsp; (Flip to the book of Philemon for spoilers.)&nbsp; What's wrong with the so-called "Purity Movement"?&nbsp; Guys, these questions come up in just the first 10 minutes...&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's Juan thinking today?</p>
<p>To contact the Comedian Next Door, email <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a> . To find out where Juan is touring, visit Castingcrowns.com&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Guess what, Pkarlgh?&nbsp; Did you guess the Podcast Ninja (Luke McKinney) is on the mic with us today?!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pod Ninja doesn't listen to The Comedian Next Door episodes. So, sometimes we need him to sit at the table while we talk, just so he knows what we've been talking about...</p>
<p>There's CONTROVERSY! (But when isn't that the case?) It's a good thing we are part of the Fight Laugh Feast Network, where upsetting people on the internet doesn't neessarily mean the end of our career.&nbsp;<br /><br />We've upset the nurses and the LGBT mob (multiple times), and now we've got the teachers worked up.</p>
<p>John maintains the belief that children should not have access to every, single book ever written.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people tried to make the case that Song of Solomon is just as smutty as the raunchy romance novels being discovered in children's libraries--and that's HILARIOUS.</p>
<p>Later: Even good intentions can lead to disastrous outcomes when teachers try to "save" kids from their own parents.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally:&nbsp; That Hideous Strength and the Abolition of Man really are worth the hype.&nbsp; C.S. Lewis was ridiculously insightful.&nbsp; And--humans are like stringed instruments, needing to be tuned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, email us at <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>&nbsp; Also--come on vacation with us in July! Details about Vacay with Comics are at johnbranyan.com.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/e170dd02-bc68-4f99-aaf4-2da2f411b10c/tcnd-the-peaches-is-back-bball-book-banning-and-new-age-nonsense.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, hello, Neighbor! Amanda (The Peaches) is back, and boy has she missed you!&nbsp; Really, she's the Brett Cooper of the Fight Laugh Feast Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a long hiatus, we're back at the kitchen table and trying desperately to organize all our many, many thoughts.</p>
<p>Let's talk about those anonymously-run Facebook groups that exist solely to "call out" a particular person or organization.&nbsp; There's something unhealthy about spending<em> all your time</em> thinking and talking about the so-called sins of a particular individual. That's the sort of obsession that tends to make a person crazy--which could explain how, after a few years, they may end up doxxing a teenaged boy and not realizing how insane that looks to normal people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; John has spent many days attracting hate comments on social media (hundreds of them) because he just keeps repeating his belief that children should not be groomed with sexually explicit material at their government school...&nbsp; &nbsp;John's posts are, of course, ridiculous because there has never been any sexually explicit material found in ANY government school--and also, taking away the sexually explicit material that minors NEEEEEEEED to access in school would be Fascism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally:&nbsp; The topic of New Ageism and Occult practices just keeps popping up. Did you know where the term "hoodwinked" came from, Pkarlgh?&nbsp; How could a person POSSIBLY be messing with Ouija boards and crystals and shakras and spell-casting and trying to make contact with dead people and STILL think she's a "Christian?"&nbsp; Great question!</p>
<p>You should come on vacation with us, Neighbor. Details about Vacay with Comics are at johnbranyan.com. Also, you can email us at <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor!&nbsp; This is PART TWO of this conversation with founding member of Casting Crowns, Juan DeVevo.&nbsp; &nbsp;For some reason, he hasn't yet moved his family to Indiana in order to live in our backyard.&nbsp; Sooooo, our long distance conversations tend to get pretty lengthy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Why are people so quick to leave their churches? The vast majority don't have any loyalty or sense of family-commitment.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor!&nbsp; Please enjoy Part 1 of this conversation with founding member of Casting Crowns, Juan DeVevo.&nbsp; &nbsp;For some reason, he hasn't yet moved his family to Indiana in order to live in our backyard.&nbsp; Sooooo, our long distance conversations tend to get pretty lengthy.&nbsp;<br /><br />John wants to talk about drama he started on Facebook recently by suggesting that Christians shouldn't be so quick to leave their churches...</p>
<p>People don't read well; they think in memes. But, worse still, they treat church attendance like consumers treat a bad interaction with the manager of a restaurant...</p>
<p>Juan sums it up nicely mid-episode: "You're drawing a line between, 'This is the place I get my oil changed' and 'This is my FAMILY.'"&nbsp;<br /><br />Pull up a seat and let's see if these two brothers are able to fix all the problems with the Church in the next 60 minutes...&nbsp; Please forgive the abrupt ending! haha.&nbsp;<br /><br />Find Juan DeVevo at castingcrowns.com and John Branyan at johnbranyan.com.&nbsp; Email us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Comedian Next Door!&nbsp; Jeff Hicks is a pastor and friend-of-a-friend.&nbsp; This is his first conversation with John outside of social media. Get to know the two of them as they get to know each other! We'll see whether there's any truth to the idea that having Christ is common makes two men brothers, even when they're strangers...</p>
<p>First, John shares bits of his testimony from early college days, listening to church leaders spar and debate. He quickly learned not every Christian was tough enough to sharpen iron.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, why do pastors seems to talk differently with their peers than they talk when they're with the rest of the Church?</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the table, Neighbor. When you're listening to this podcast, we call you "Pkarlgh." On this FIRST episode of 2023, The Comedian (John Branyan) interviews Jason Farley!&nbsp;You've heard him on Knox Unplugged and CrossPolitic.&nbsp;This is Part Two of their conversation about "deconstructionism."</p>
<p>"What are you even saying to me right now?!" That's what the guys feel like shouting when they're talking to Deconstructionists. Atheists and other Postmodern Deconstructionists only want to UN-define words--never define them.</p>
<p>Pull up a chair and join the conversation. You're visiting the Comedian Next Door.&nbsp;(If you missed part 1, what's wrong with you?! Go back to last week and listen!)</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the table, Neighbor. When you're listening to this podcast, we call you "Pkarlgh." On this FIRST episode of 2023, The Comedian (John Branyan) interviews Jason Farley!&nbsp; You've heard him on Knox Unplugged and CrossPolitic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Deconstruction. What is it? Why is everyone doing it?&nbsp; Even the people who are practicing "deconstruction" don't seem to know how to define it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jason helps John understand why nothing is really understandable... or something?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pull up a chair and join the conversation. You're visiting the Comedian Next Door.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor Pkarlgh!&nbsp; &nbsp;Please don't mind the poor audio quality during the month of the December. We are rebroadcasting some of our very first podcasts EVER. (Today's episode was first published in the fall of 2016, when Emmi was a wee nursling.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us tell you about the Breastfeeding Activist/Feminists who have turned the act of feeding their children into a Side Show for the Church Ministers to gush over.&nbsp; Please don't "normalize" laying hands on breastfeeding women during service...</p>
<p>Are you familiar with breastfeeding vanity pictures?&nbsp; Good grief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But don't listen to the Peaches. Her only goal in life is to hurt breastfeeding mothers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reach out to us by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com .</a></p>
<p>And why not come on vacation with the Branyan Family and their comedian friends??? Visit johnbranyan.com for more details about Vacay with Comics 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, remember:&nbsp; if you have a problem with whatever I'm doing, cover YOUR head.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome, Neighbor! We're continuing our rebroadcast of John's first podcast episodes, ever.&nbsp; This is the Comedy Sojourn Episode #2, originally published in September 2016.&nbsp; Please forgive the audio issues. We were rubes back then... (Not like now--because these days we always get our audio equipment to work perfectly.)</p>
<p>Andrew and Tabby are John's two youngest children, and they have a lot to say about a spider they caught.&nbsp; Should they kill it or catch-and-release?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode:</p>
<p>"You could get eight really good drumsticks from that spider." --John Branyan</p>
<p>"We have butts, and we can't spin webs...cigarettes have butts, and they can't spin webs."</p>
<p>Tabby is getting married later this week, but she won't come back to visit if Dad and Andrew let the spider go in the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...Did you know, Dad, that some turtles breathe out of their butts?" --Tabby (Branyan) Farkas</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; John and the Peaches talk about the Atheist Hospice Care Worker.&nbsp; (With just a few interruptions from young girls with noisy toys.)&nbsp; How can an Atheist assign value to end-of-life care?</p>
<p>Quote from The Way of the Heathen: "We matter because we matter to each other in our own short time on our own short scale...we make each other important."</p>
<p>Reach out to John and the Peaches by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor!</p>
<p>It's nearly December, and things are hectic around here. So, we're REPOSTING the very first podcast episodes we ever published!&nbsp; &nbsp;These were the days long before we joined the Fight Laugh Feast Network--when we sat around a tiny, hand-held recorder at JOHN'S house (not the Peaches' house), and we let the dog in and out while we chatted about culture, faith, and family.&nbsp;<br /><br />On this inaugural episode:</p>
<div>We explain the purpose of the podcast is to invite our neighbors into the chaos of our everyday life, for good conversation. There are some clicks, pops, and other technical issues with the recording because the producer is an amateurish hack who lacks even basic recording skills.&nbsp; He improves in future episodes...(kind of).</div>
<p>The Peaches and John discuss the usefulness of spirited debate in culture and religion.&nbsp; We also discuss whether or not Cami should have a snack.</p>
<p>This was first broadcasted in the fall of 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reach out to the Comedian Next Door, email <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>.&nbsp; Also, visit johnbranyan.com to get your tickets to Vacay with Comics 2023. It's going to be epic.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The intro is fake news.&nbsp; John isn't at the kitchen table--and The Peaches isn't co-hosting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />David Pendleton is a long time friend of the family and a gifted ventriloquist.&nbsp; (That's the type of skill that translates well in an audio-only podcast, doesn't it?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The men talk about various projects they're working on, but they DON'T want to be "intentional" with their conversation. (Ew.)&nbsp; &nbsp;David wants the conversation to be interesting for you, Neighbor.&nbsp; But--John isn't very worried about that...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cue the unscripted discussion now!</p>
<p>-Why do we only call our friends when we have something specific to talk about? (Or is that just a "Male Tendency"?)</p>
<p>-What are the differences between "real conversation" and social media speeches? (And what's up with texting?)</p>
<p>-The lack of human interaction is impacting how people actually THINK and process reality.</p>
<p>AND MORE!...including some discussion about prison sentences and the death penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find more information about David Pendleton's comedy by visiting anythingcantalk.com.&nbsp; Also, reach out to John Branyan by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>.&nbsp; Thanks for visiting with us, Neighbor!&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're at the end of a long, tiring day. But we're still going to record a podcast, because we're just that generous, Neighbor! Get ready for some hard-hitting social commentary.</p>
<p>John is concerned his vote may not be counted because of his writing utensil, and the Peaches briefly considered running for school board on the platform: "My Kids Will Never Attend Here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEXT: There's an article published by Desiring God which actually acknowledges the sinfulness of women, and we almost can't believe it!&nbsp; (Title: "She Needs Truth: How Hard Words Serve Women")</p>
<p>LATER: Imagine being inspired and uplifted by a politician's speech... Imagine needing to hear that a Democratic candidate "sees you."&nbsp; Yikes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINALLY: Social media has really messed up a lot of people.&nbsp; The Peaches used to see the Internet as a Mission Field, but maybe we've been sending people out there to evangelize before they were ready. Christians are not doing a great job standing up to the evil, on the whole.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome, Neighbor!&nbsp; Around here, November means BURNING STUFF! But how does Doug Wilson get away from that fire at JUST the right moment?!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's chat about Devil Magic for a little bit...</p>
<p>NEXT: We like the idea of staring a new advice column. Dear Comedi-Anne. The first question to tackle involves kids being excluded from a birthday party.&nbsp; (This story is HEARTBREAKING, Pkarlgh!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>LATER:&nbsp; We call out an online&nbsp; "influencer" by name, because he's preying on traumatized, emotional children. He has become a surrogate family for a community of people who self-identify as abuse victims. Yet, these desperate people are too wrecked to recognize BAD ADVICE when they're being given it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reach out to us by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>. The holiday season is upon us, and it's the perfect time to plan your Christmas gifts.&nbsp; Why not get tickets to VACAY WITH COMICS 2023? More details at johnbranyan.com.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Whoops, we're publishing a day late! But it's always worth it...</p>
<p>Broadcasting from John's house--but the Peaches forgot to pack the headphones. So, we can't hear anything we're producing. Hopefully it sounds okay.&nbsp;<br /><br />John just got back from doing a comedy show for less than 30 people. This leads us to discuss the way audience size (and location) affects the way we talk.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does that mean we're being inauthentic or two-faced because we alter our style for different occassions?&nbsp;<br /><br />Pull up a chair at the table!<br /><br />Visit johnbranyan.com to join the Comedy Clique and support The Comedian Next Door.&nbsp; We're going on VACATION in July 2023, and we want you to come with us.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We can't promise this conversation will be better than LAST week's, but ...welcome to the table anyway!</p>
<p>Emmi is wearing a lot of hats, and The Peaches is going to her dance class soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Oops, sorry, we mean "rhymic movement.")</p>
<p>Let's talk about Legalism!&nbsp; First--we give a brief history of things that would get you reprimanded by Church People 40 years ago. (Cards, alcohol-consumption, and dancing!)&nbsp; The anti-dancing crowd will say it's important to "avoid the appearance of evil."&nbsp; And, to that, a ready reply should be: "True! So why don't you stop appearing to be such a Pharisee???"&nbsp; &nbsp; This is known as Good Rhetoric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, The Peaches makes an excellent transition to discussing the NEW Legalism: Internet Karens who say all disciplinary spanking is abusive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be a Pharisee.&nbsp; So--Christians need to use this fact to their rhetorical advantage.&nbsp; In other words, we need to get better at framing the anti-spank Pharisees as judgmental jerks.&nbsp; If you're looking for an example of an actual social media exchange with a Pearl-Clutching Karen who doesn't love her kids enough to spank them, we've got you covered!&nbsp; Visit Kendra Tierney's blog, Catholic All Year, if you want great advice from an experience mom who spanks her kids with great results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com -- and visit the website (johnbranyan.com) for information about going on vacation with us!&nbsp; &nbsp;Vacay with Comics, 2023.&nbsp; It's gonna be great.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John has been feeling weird and bad and dumb.&nbsp; That's his way of describing his anxiety attacks which popped up this week out of nowhere.&nbsp; Maybe he needs to do a Brain Dump! (Trademark: Mystie Winckler.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>But...wait, why is Luke wearing a bathrobe?&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, this family knows how to throw some REALLY "dood" parties!&nbsp; But we wouldn't be able to juggle all of those planning details if we didn't have a concrete plan.&nbsp; Don't try to memorize your to do list, Pkarlgh!&nbsp; (A loaf of bread, a container of milk, and a stick of butter.)&nbsp; That's a terrible use of brain power.</p>
<p>Write it down, and then you can free up space for problem-solving...</p>
<p>Next:&nbsp; John thinks memorizing the alphabet is stupid.&nbsp; Total waste of time.&nbsp; Please feel free to weigh in, Pkarlgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later: The Peaches has a new BFF! You should follow Brooks Gibbs on social media. He is a psychologist who teaches kids to be mentally resilient, rather than trying to rid the world of bullies.&nbsp; His advice isn't only appropriate for children in schools... He also may have some things to teach grown-ups who are struggling with anxiety.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Kitchen Table of the Comedian Next Door! The Peaches has been feeling more like her old self--which means plenty of things to complain about from the hellish world of social media...</p>
<p>First, one of the Sister Wives divorced her husband.&nbsp; Word on the street is, this particular Sister Wife thinks it's "ridiculous" that her husband's attraction to her is affected by the way she treats other members of the family...&nbsp; (Unsurprisingly, the Internet agrees.)</p>
<p>Next, women have been expecting their husbands to read their minds for a long time. Now--they are beginning to judge their other friends and relatives by the same standard.&nbsp; Love means just KNOWING what to do WITHOUT HAVING TO ASK!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, here are two articles for your consideration.&nbsp; &nbsp; "<a href="https://www.commonsense.news/p/hurts-so-good">Hurts So Good</a>"--about the sudden rise in invisible illnesses. Are mental illnesses contagious?&nbsp; "<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/12/a-new-way-to-be-mad/304671/">A New Way to be Mad</a>"--first published in 2000, about the link between Transgenderism and people who want to remove healthy limbs/digits.</p>
<p>Join us at the Fight, Laugh, Feast Conference in Knoxville, October 6th-8th.&nbsp; John will be glad to see you, even if The Peaches isn't.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We open this episode celebrating John's birthday!&nbsp; (Sometimes we celebrate his birthday when he's not actually present...)&nbsp; Tabby is here for a little bit, and the cherry delight is truly delightful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered why restaurants often sing a special happy birthday song rather than the traditional version, allow Tabby to make up a nonsense explanation! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Later: John is encouraging his small congregation to visit ANOTHER small congregation for Sunday services. Does that make him weird?&nbsp; (Short answer: yes.)<br /><br />We spend the rest of the show unpacking WHY John is so weird.&nbsp; And we'll explain why every local church body in the country is a little bit different, but also mostly the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which role do you play in YOUR local church, Neighbor?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com to share your thoughts. Also, consider supporting John Branyan Comedy by joining the Clique!

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the table of the Comedian Next Door!&nbsp; Sometimes our kids are afraid of strange/funny things and we spend 10-15 minutes telling the stories.&nbsp; (Hot Tip for potty training: let your toddler run around pantless!)&nbsp;<br /><br />What scared you when you were young?&nbsp; Was it a creepy clown painting or non-existent bugs in your bed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also: have you noticed the Texas Roadhouse logo kind of looks like a rabbit, if you look at it veeeeeeeery carefully.&nbsp; Come find us at the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in October, and we'll have Cami show you!<br /><br />Then:&nbsp; People are very offended at the idea that men become kings of a tiny kingdom when they get married. If you don't know why, then you're part of the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody in Moscow seems to be obsessed with warfare! (And that includes the critics, who are more than ready to show up and fight.)<br /><br />Finally, the Peaches sent an email to an app developer letting them know that abortion is NOT healtcare. If you'd like to email the same company, the address we used was: <a href="mailto:service@biowink.com">service@biowink.com</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />We'll see you in Knoxville October 6th-8th!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/8c3c7823-9b59-4c03-b2d8-59d27f53fef5/tcnd-the-flf-baptism-debate-mr-nippl-e.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table of The Comedian Next Door. Please don't mind the heavy machinery tearing down perfectly healthy trees in our backyard. We're not happy about it--but we don't have much say when the government decides to be destructive.&nbsp;<br /><br />There was some drama in the network this week on the topic of baptism, so we need to take our turn beating the horse.&nbsp; Does "baptist" theology lead to transgender ideology?<br /><br /></p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<p>-If we want to IMPACT the culture, we must be prepared to take some responsibility when our IMPACT isn't a good one.&nbsp;<br /><br />-How do we label the smaller subset of Christians who promote individualism and making PERSONAL DECISIONS for Jesus?&nbsp; (Should we call them "baptists?")&nbsp;</p>
<p>-We must pause to manage the crying child...</p>
<p>-Lots of children have gone to Church Camp and "made a decision" to identify as a Christian only to turn around two years later and "identify" as the opposite gender. Coincidence? Maybe.</p>
<p>-Look at the way parents often shrug and say "we did our best, but we can't control our kids."&nbsp; If they won't take responsibility for the way their kids turn out, then who will?</p>
<p>And more!</p>
<p>We want to see you at the FLF Conference, October 6th-8th in Knoxville. Details at flfnetwork.com.&nbsp; Also--if you've ever wondered what it would be like to go on vacation with a bunch of comedian friends, we have a GREAT opportunity for you. Visit johnbranyan.com to learn more about VACAY WITH COMICS, coming July 2023.&nbsp;<br /><br />Email the Comedian and his family at: nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table--where we're eating soup/salad and thanking God for banana bread.&nbsp; The 6-year-old, Emmi, has some concerns about life after death that will make your heart melt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>THEN, we share a Sea Chanty that was written by our good friend, John thomas Oaks, to promote Vacay with Comics! If you've wondered what it would be like to go on vacation with a bunch of Christian comedians, this is the event for you.&nbsp; Visit johnbranyan.com for more information. (And, to see the video version of this song, visit the John Branyan YouTube Channel.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally,&nbsp; John talks about an interview between Pete Holmes and Tom Segura, with the totally-not-clickbait title "PETE HOLMES HATES THESE CHRISTIAN JOKES!"<br /><br />There are two problems. #1. Pete Holmes is an ex-Christian who still tries to speak like some type of authority on Christian culture.&nbsp; #2.&nbsp; The "jokes" (and "comedians") he mocks do not represent the best Christian material out there.&nbsp; Everyone agrees the jokes are corny and terribly--including the vast majority of Christians.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the table of the Comedian Next Door, John Branyan. Although, technically, this particular table belongs to his daughter, Amanda. Let us introduce you to our good friend, Pete Heck.&nbsp; Pete writes for Not-the-Bee and is a public school history/government teacher.&nbsp; Make sure you Google "Trump Globe Hands," for some reason...<br /><br />Anyway, eventually we get around to chatting about the dire state of public education--which is one of our favorite topics.&nbsp; To quote the public school teacher, "The system is fatally flawed."&nbsp; So...what should Christians do now?</p>
<p>Even churched kids don't have basic Bible knowledge. The majority of students are coming from broken homes, with no foundation for how to live in a healthy family/community.&nbsp; Stay tuned for the end of the episode, when Pete tells us exactly how to fix all of these serious issues!</p>
<p>You can find Peter's personal website at peterheck.com and many of his articles at notthebee.com.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you enjoy content from The Comedian, please consider joining the Comedy Clique. (Details at johnbranyan.com)&nbsp; Also--have you wondered what it would be like to go on vacation with a bunch of comedians?!&nbsp; You need to join us for Vacay with Comics 2023.<br /><br />Finally, we'll be joining our Fight Laugh Feast brothers and sisters at the FLF Conference October 6th-8th.&nbsp; If you haven't registered yet, WHY NOT?!&nbsp; (flfnetwork.com)</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>After several weeks of postponements, we finally got ahold of Kenn Kington.&nbsp; He preaches sometimes, but he's not a pastor. And he tells jokes sometimes, but he may not be a comedian, either. We spend some time swapping adorable kid stories before we get down to business...</p>
<p>Bill Burr performed an amazing rant about abortion recently. Why are the PAGAN Comedians being more unabashedly truthful from stage than the Christian ones?!</p>
<p>Kenn and John both share examples of jokes/bits that were considered "too offensive" by certain church people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also: what's with all the "second-hand" offense these days?</p>
<p>Check out Kenn's drybar special by Googling Kenn Kington Drybar. He's trying to get a million views!&nbsp; Also, visit johnbranyan.com to join the Branyan Comedy Clique and support the show.&nbsp; We'll see you at the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville October 6th-8th!&nbsp; (Details at flfnetwork.com)</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're not at the kitchen table today...we're in front of our computer screens, video-chatting with our friend, Juan DeVevo.&nbsp; It takes us forever to introduce him and the topic--so please bear with us while we shoot the breeze.&nbsp;<br /><br />Juan is a founding member and "Stage Left Guitar Player" for Casting Crowns. So, let's talk about worship music.&nbsp; (And don't forget to give us two things you LOVE every time you say something you "hate.")<br /><br />What does John have against modern praise music? What would it take to win him over?<br /><br />Also--what does this have to do with chicken nuggets?</p>
<p>We'll cover all of these things and much, much more!&nbsp; In fact, this is an EXTENDED EPISODE, which would have been even longer if The Peaches hadn't decided when to pull the plug...</p>
<p>You can find Juan's touring schedule at castingcrowns.com.&nbsp; Also--visit johnbranyan.com for details about VACAY WITH COMICS. Coming in July, 2023.&nbsp; We'll see you at the Fight Laugh Feast Conference October 6th-8th in Knoxville.&nbsp; (Flfnetwork.com for more information.)</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the table at the Comedian's house...and welcome to "Kokomo Beach" as well.&nbsp;<br />We've been doing some hard work managing our emotions lately...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>John used a passage in 1 Timothy when he was teaching at youth Bible Study this week. What does "rebuke" mean? And what does "exhort" mean? Ask your kids to define words for you, Neighbor! It helps them learn to think!</p>
<p>Later: we give some examples of adults who struggle with ethical dilemmas because they aren't wise.&nbsp; &nbsp; What would you do if the boat was sinking and you could only save 4 out of 10 people?&nbsp; (Why not just roll dice?)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then: what would you do if you got pregnant out of wedlock and didn't want to confess to your family?<br /><br />Finally:&nbsp; Pilgrim's progress is a really great story. Kids don't have the capacity to understand it fully. But, with some life experience (and maturity), it really hits you!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />If you'd like to contact the Comedian, you can email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com.&nbsp; We are gearing up for the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville, October 6th-8th.&nbsp; Details at flfnetwork.com!&nbsp; Also, come on vacation with a bunch of comedians. Details about Vacay with Comics 2023, at johnbranyan.com.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John and The Peaches are joined at the table by Tabby--the other sister.&nbsp; Tabby's baby is a grabby baby. (Say that three times fast.)&nbsp; The conversation ambles around family and food... and then we get down to business!</p>
<p>The camping trip last week did NOT go according to plan.&nbsp; Spoilers: there was car trouble and much, much, much vomit.&nbsp;<br /><br />What can we do when the family trip just keeps delivering blow after blow? How can we be emotionally okay--when things are falling apart physically?<br /><br />On the one hand, it's nice to feel needed and to have your job clearly laid out in front of you. But how many of us actually live as though we believe that "blessings come through raindrops and healing comes through tears"?&nbsp; &nbsp;(Update: That song is only 11 years old. But it might as well be 30.)<br /><br />It's a miracle of the Holy Spirit whenever ANYONE is able to step outside the terrible situation and stay Kingdom-minded.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then:&nbsp; WHYYYYYY ME?!?!?! Lessons from Nancy Kerrigan and the Pipe Incident...&nbsp;<br /><br />Later: Why were the city fireworks so weird this year?&nbsp; We don't know for sure, but now John has a great idea for a musical.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you'd like to contact the Comedian Next Door, email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com. Also--we want you to come on vacation with our family and several of our Comedian Friends. Visit the johnbranyan.com and get more information about VACAY WITH COMICS 2023.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor! Pull up a chair because we've got a cute story about kids at the Bubble Show.&nbsp; The Kingdom of Heaven is made up of such as these...</p>
<p>Then:&nbsp; A survey of parks in our hometown. Maybe this isn't interesting to anyone else--but you can Google "Jackson Morrow Park Kokomo" and confirm we're TELLING THE TRUTH about this!</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; John got into some trouble suggesting that women shouldn't be "comedians" the same way men can...&nbsp; Allow him to clarify.&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually, he admits the women in his family are very funny, which prompts the Peaches to share a story about the dream she had. (One word: Ants)</p>
<p>Finally, go check out Facebook and see the horde of angry trolls on John's page. How the heathen rage when Christians celebrate life.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Every Sunday at 7:00pm Eastern, four Christian entertainers host the best LIVE YouTube event of the whole week! It's called the Starving Comics Quarantine Show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't been tuning in for the live broadcasts, here's a little sample of what you've been missing...</p>
<p>On this episode, Juan DeVevo is out on the road and Jt's keyboard crashed. (This is why we have a sound check!)&nbsp; Also, we have a special guest in the studio: Kristin Weber! She's an expert on Adulting for Jesus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John surprises Jt with something that will change the course of the entire show. And, later, we play a new game called "Channels," which makes a lot more sense when you can SEE the television.<br /><br />If you're ready to watch this show live, subscribe to the John Branyan YouTube channel and tune in every Sunday evening! Also, consider supporting content like this by visiting johnbranyan.com and joining the Comedy Clique.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John and the Peaches are sitting at the table with mugs of tea. But no sugar for John, Please! He is deeply invested in a fad diet--and it's taking over his dreams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you're at the Comedian's house today, you can help us get ready for Family Camp next week.&nbsp; John is scheduled to deliver four talks, plus games and activities, so we need to figure out which topics to cover with the campers. (Somebody grab a pen and write this stuff down!)<br /><br />-Comedy is able to thrive in families because of shared contexts/experiences. There are lots of opportunities for "inside jokes" and call-backs!</p>
<p>-Good improv works because comedy is built into the game... and guess Who built comedy into the Game of Life?</p>
<p>-In order to do comedy better, learn to ask lots of questions.</p>
<p>-Tell kids the truth...&nbsp; (You have to understand what's true in order to make jokes about it.)</p>
<p>If all of this seems a bit disjointed and random, it's because we still have some polishing to do before next week!&nbsp; What else should we cover in our presentations, Neighbor? Which bits of wisdom/advice from The Comedian have been most helpful to you?&nbsp; <br />Send us your recommendations:&nbsp; nextdoor@johnbranyan.com&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, visit johnbranyan.com for information about VACAY WITH COMICS 2023.&nbsp; We're going camping with a bunch of John's comedian friends, and we want your family to join us.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John's a little under the weather, but he's going to soldier on!&nbsp; It's very, very hot in our neck of the woods, and it's reminding us of happy childhood memories, digging holes and making "Mixtures." Those were the days, right?!<br /><br />Next: John tells us his idea for making Pride Parades into "family friendly" events.&nbsp; But the Peaches is worried his idea might be a little too much fun...</p>
<p>Finally: the Atheists are swarming on John's Facebook page.&nbsp; You can go look at some of their comments, but don't spend too much time trying to climb inside their heads and think like they do.&nbsp; It's hellish in there.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you'd like to connect with the Comedian and his family, you can email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com .&nbsp; We're going to be hosting another Vacay with Comics in July of 2023!&nbsp; Please be on the lookout for details on our website (johnbranyan.com) ....but cut John some slack because it's really hot up in the attic where he works.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table of the Comedian Next Door!&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, we start with a parable... No, wait, we have to talk about pet food first....&nbsp; Oh, and we need to pause and sort out some child drama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, NOW we're going to hear a parable about a church with a strange number of house fires. Everybody's house is burning to the ground around here!&nbsp; What is going on???</p>
<p>We need to look at the fruit that church people are producing. And then we need to have the courage to stop taking advice from broke people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Instead of buying fireworks, why don't you teach your kids the basic tenents of Christianity?&nbsp; (Pssst, Christianity teaches more than just "love people.")<br /><br />If you'd like to reach out to the Comedian and his family, you can email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com .&nbsp; Also, consider supporting the show by visiting johnbranyan.com and joining the Comedy Clique! We'll see you at the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in October, Neighbor! (Details at flfnetwork.com)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John and the Peaches are on a video call with Tabby and our new intern...&nbsp; So--rather than joining us at the table, you can roll up at a chair at the office desk!</p>
<p>Today, we're talking about the fact that things change and people grow, and sometimes we regret things we said years ago.&nbsp; (Hey, that rhymes.)&nbsp; We place a high value on "consistency" (as opposed to hypocrisy), which is a good thing EXCEPT there may come a point where the focus on consistency will prevent us from making necessary changes.&nbsp; Why are we so afraid to be DIFFERENT than we were in the past?<br /><br />In this episode:</p>
<p>-We can't say all the truth things at once. Only God can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Do something that Future Tabby will thank you for! (Good job, Past Tabby.)<br /><br />-How can an aspiring young minion get her foot in the door of the entertainment industry?&nbsp; (Spoiler: The Comedian doesn't know.)<br /><br />Plus more!</p>
<p>If you'd like to contact us, email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com.&nbsp; Also, consider supporting the show by visiting johnbranyan.com and joining the Comedy Clique.&nbsp; Mark your calendars for July 27th to 30th, 2023.&nbsp; We're going on a VACAY WITH COMICS, and we want you to come laugh with us.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table of the comedian next door!&nbsp; All the kids are here, making a joyful noise next to the recorder.&nbsp; But we're not going to "shush" them unless/until they do something wrong...<br /><br />This week, we learned that we are the reason some people don't want to come to church. And what have we been doing to cause them to be so completely repulsed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've been laughing! (The horror.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is WAY TOO MUCH SADNESS in the world for Christians to spend any time being funny.&nbsp; Do you have any idea how many traumatic experiences happen in churches?!&nbsp; We have so much crying to do and so little time...&nbsp; Stop smiling! This is serious!</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the table, Neighbor! Go ahead and take the Peaches' seat because she's not using it much.&nbsp; There's too much parenting to do!<br /><br />Meanwhile, John wants to tell you about some of his terrible experiences with comedy shows this week.&nbsp; (But, really, the terrible shows make for the best stories.)<br /><br />Also--we got an email this week. Thanks for sending us details about your childlike joys!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we get pretty raw and honest about the insomnia and mood swings and how it's affecting parenting decisions.&nbsp; We're trying to teach our kids to do the right thing, even when they don't feel like it.&nbsp; But, we have to practice what we preach first!<br /><br />You can contact us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's Bonus Conversation has to do with all things education.&nbsp; The Peaches doesn't know which is more outside of her control:&nbsp; her ability to sleep at night, or her ability to make her son do his schoolwork...</p>
<p>In our community, most of our brothers and sisters in Christ are NOT familiar with the philosophy of education that is commonplace among people in the Fight Laugh Feast Network.&nbsp; &nbsp;We don't have a church full of Christians who "get it," and that feels discouraging sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an analogy about painting a garage that might feel relatable...</p>
<p>It's difficult to help others educate their children in Christian orthodoxy, when the parents were ALSO products of public school.&nbsp; How to we even begin to unpack all the misunderstandings and bad assumptions?</p>
<p>You can reach out to us by emailing nextdoor@johnbranyan.com.&nbsp; Also, visit flfnetwork.com to get more information about the Fight Laugh Feast Conference. (That's coming up in October. Be there or be square!)&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Comedian's house is busy (as always).&nbsp; Let the 4-year-old explain why he "needs" to use tongs to handle his Elmo doll...&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're continuing to "plod" along with our daily tasks--but sometimes the process feels painfully slow. If you're an older mother who has successfully raised her children in the Lord, the Peaches could use some encouragement.&nbsp; Email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com to share your testimony of how daily, ordinary faithfulness has paid off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; Look at all the amazing things our bodies are able to do... like REMEMBERING things that happened in the past and driving to church without crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who are we to decide what's "too much" for us to handle? Wouldn't we think most of our ordinary activities were "too much," if we hadn't experienced being able to do them?</p>
<p>The Peaches has been convicted that she has been influenced by the Materialist culture more than she realized.&nbsp; There are many assumptions about the limitations of our physical bodies which come from "science" (and "experts" in Biology) rather than from Scripture...</p>
<p>Many other things get brought up as well, but it's a bit difficult to outline. Pull up a chair at the table and join us!</p>
<p>Visit johnbranyan.com to Join the Comedy Clique and support the show.&nbsp; You also can visit flfnetwork.com for more information about the Fight Laugh Feast Conference, coming up in October.&nbsp; Our family will be there (Lord willing).&nbsp; Will yours?&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

But--by the grace of God--Cami was able to do the right thing and get back into fellowship with Collin.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is being uploaded late, due to tech difficulties. Sorry about that, Neighbor Pkarlgh!<br /><br />Our family is celebrating Cami's 11th birthday this week, but not everyone is excited about her party's theme.&nbsp; Is it okay for Christians to read stories about magic and witchcraft?... We discuss this briefly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then:&nbsp; it's encouraging to know that God has been revealing pieces of his Truth to EVERY nation in EVERY era.&nbsp; But, when are we allowed to agree with the pagans?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or are we running the risk of compromising our faith in order to get along with more people?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us regale you with a very long-winded anecdote with borrowed from The King's Hall Podcast.&nbsp; Don't be quick to divide and sell the land of your inheretance, Neighbor!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact us by emailing nextdoor@johnbranyan.com, and you can support the show by becomining a member of John's Comedy Clique.&nbsp; Details at johnbranyan.com.</p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/489f19a7-553e-4391-83d5-77753cde265d/tcnd-why-is-everyone-deconstructing-kylie-bikini.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The house is FULL of family today (especially noisy kids)--and we don't feel much like podcasting...&nbsp; But, we're doing it anyway!&nbsp; &nbsp;Tabby is at the table, and Megan grabs a mic later in the episode as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John wants to talk about why so many Christians seem to be "deconstructing" their faith.&nbsp; We think we mostly agree with the article he quotes.<br /><br />Young Americans no longer trust large institutions like the government, the medical establishment, and the Church.&nbsp; They've become loners who trust no one except themselves...and it's getting to the point where they don't really trust themselves, either. (That's what happens when you have been taught to see through everything. There's no end to the free fall.)</p>
<p>Christians have access to information about other belief systems and worldviews they didn't have 100 years ago, which may tempt them away from their faith.&nbsp; But--more importantly--they don't have the skills necessary to discern what's true and what's false.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pull up a chair and join the discussion!&nbsp; &nbsp;Email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com with your comments. Also--be looking for more information about the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in October.&nbsp; We'll see you there, Neighbor!</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Podcast Ninja (Luke) is at the table today.&nbsp; We begin by talking about how much fun comedian's have when they're driving about 10 hours, to and from a show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, the Peaches reminds John about how wrong he was two episodes ago... (Remember when John was wrong, Neighbor?) But she's actually trying to make him feel better by sharing something that convicted HER lately:&nbsp; CS Lewis had a different perspective on Emotionalism than we typically have on this podcast!</p>
<p>Please enjoy some quotes from The Abolition of Man.</p>
<p>"[People who are wrong] see the world around them swayed by emotional propaganda &mdash; they have learned from tradition&nbsp;that youth is sentimental &mdash; and they conclude that the best thing they can do is to&nbsp;fortify the minds of young people against emotion. My own experience as a&nbsp;teacher tells an opposite tale. For every one pupil who needs to be guarded from a&nbsp;weak excess of sensibility there are three who need to be awakened from the&nbsp;slumber of cold vulgarity. The task of the modern educator is not to cut down&nbsp;jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defence against false sentiments is to&nbsp;inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make&nbsp;them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes. For famished nature will be&nbsp;avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head."&nbsp; --CS Lewis</p>
<p>John doesn't think we have been guilty of downplaying emotions.&nbsp; BUT, his young grandson recently confessed to feeling guilty about liking video games, so...</p>
<p>What do you think, Neighbor? Are Christians accidentally creating hard hearts, as a remedy for soft heads?&nbsp; Or are we doing a decent job passing on an appreciation for objective beauty and majestic music and passionate poetry?<br /><br />Send us your comments:&nbsp; nextdoor@johnbranyan.com&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, tune in later this week for MORE CONTENT from The Comedian Next Door.&nbsp; (If you'd like to support the show, consider joining the Comedy Clique. Details at johnbranyan.com)</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Stress, Hollywood, and Osteen (Stinkbug on the Wall) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/2ee3fd88-5345-4987-95be-4e5f92bdc66b/tcnd-stress-hollywood-and-osteen-stinkbug-on-the-wall.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Comedian and The Peaches are talking about heartrate and stress.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently, it's possible for your body to be stressed without your mind being aware of it. Who knew?</p>
<p>We always talk about not being able to trust our emotions, but we can't always trust our thoughts and perceptions, either...</p>
<p>Sometimes the tasks that would be stressful for others actually calm us down. That's our comfort zone!&nbsp; But sometimes we have panic attacks on airplanes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, John makes a few confusing announcements about when he'll be performing at Gutty's comedy club. (He's appearing at the Minneapolis Gutty's on April 22nd and 23rd, and the Indianapolis Gutty's on April 29th and 30th.)&nbsp; Also, the Peaches sees a bug on the wall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, John's dental hygienist asked for his opinion about the infamous Chris Rock and Will Smith Slap, so he shares that opinion with you, Neighbor Pkarlgh!&nbsp; Basically, the people of Hollywood are not doing very well!</p>
<p>Being unable to handle Mean Words is a sign of personal weakness.&nbsp; Don't be so easily stressed by your surroundings that you can't control your actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, what would possess Joel Osteen to block other Christians from critiquing his sermons?&nbsp; (Also, we're still trying to meet Mike Winger. If you know his people, put in a good word for us.)</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're here at the table, Neighbor Pkarlgh! (And the kids are working busily nearby.) Join us while we talk about John's latest post on social media.&nbsp; Spoilers: this conversation does not go the way he expected...</p>
<p>In this episode:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />-Why would a person post a comment that is nothing but Scripture?</p>
<p>-Social media encourages disagreement and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>-It's almost impossible to communicate with other humans...&nbsp; unless we can find common ground in Christ.</p>
<p>-We don't often treat people on social media with the same grace we give our loved ones in real life.</p>
<p>-John is defensive about being defensive.</p>
<p>-Plus MORE!</p>
<p>Bottom line: maybe we should stay in our lane by focusing on helping people find the humor in their life and choose joy.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the table, Neighbor Pkarlgh!&nbsp; &nbsp;The Peaches had an epiphany this week regarding how important it is for the human body to have food.&nbsp; Isn't it crazy the way the sun rises every morning--and putting nutrients in your stomach can change your life?</p>
<p>But let's remember: people are not just physical creatures. We have minds and souls as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later: Would you criticize a fat person at the gym?&nbsp; It's hard to wait for God to reveal the same things to other people that He has revealed to you...</p>
<p>Then:&nbsp; Are we encroaching on Relativism over here??? Or are we simply realizing a Truth about the "living and active" nature of Scripture?</p>
<p>Finally:&nbsp; Ecclesiastes seems really depressing... But, with the right perspective, it's actually encouraging.&nbsp; "NOTHING MATTERS--EVERYTHING IS MEANINGLESS!"&nbsp; It reminds us of John's saying, "Life is a joke."</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're going to be totally honest about some stuff today, Neighbor!&nbsp; &nbsp;The Peaches still has been dealing with some emotional and psychological discomfort.&nbsp; &nbsp; (We would blame the thyroid if we could, but that's has been ruled out, so.... darn.)&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes, life's trials just FEEL more weighty than other times...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hang on, we have a quick interruption while Collin amazes everyone with his poem-thingy...</p>
<p>Okay--back to the subject. The Peaches is going to be very cautious ("guarded") with her words today. But John wants to lay everything out on the table and tell you about some interpersonal conflict.&nbsp; Not everyone handles their struggles/crisis by dialoging with their Christian family and processing things.&nbsp; &nbsp;But that's how WE roll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some problems at church because many people aren't comfortable with open communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us at the table. Let's say true things.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>What do you think, Neighbor?&nbsp; &nbsp;Should John record another Dry Bar special?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, let's talk about why John keeps posting about Modesty on social media and triggering the "bossy" Feminists...</p>
<p>We don't live in a Patriarchy anymore. So, when you discover certain words/topics you're not allowed to say, it's not a bad idea to keep your finger on that nerve.</p>
<p>Our culture keeps telling women to "be themselves," but what does that even mean?</p>
<p>Next: the Peaches has some very good news! More and more Christians are becoming as grumpy and cynical as she is! Hooray!&nbsp; &nbsp;There seems to be a shift among our brothers and sisters, as if the bulk of the Church now has almost as much experience dealing with trolls on social media as we did 10 years ago!...<br /><br />Also: if you want to help the Feminists kill John using an obscure Medieval torture device, then B.Y.O.E.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally: how should we react when those few (but loud) non-believers show up to spout foolishness?&nbsp; Do we respond at all?&nbsp; Here's a quick reminder about Bully Management 101.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you enjoy being part of the conversation, consider also being part of the Clique!&nbsp; Visit Johnbranyan.com to support more John Branyan content.&nbsp; Also--if you're not already part of the Fight Laugh Feast network, visit FLFnetwork.com to get plugged in.&nbsp; The FLF Conference is happening in October!

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Good to have you at the table, Neighbor Pkarlgh!&nbsp; If you have any tips for helping Collin grow an inch taller before the summer, please let us know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now--let's talk about a book by Vishal Mangalwadi called "The Book that Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization."&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a stark difference between the assumptions of Eastern Mystics and the assumptions of philosopher who have been influenced by the principles in the Bible.&nbsp; &nbsp;Christians believe humans are valuable, because we were created in God's image. And we're also capable of using logic, because God gives us the ability (and even the command) to be reasonable.&nbsp; That changes EVERYTHING.&nbsp;<br /><br />Listen as we read some quotes about funny things Eastern Philosophers believe to be "enlightenment."&nbsp;<br /><br />Listen to all the sound of all that knowledge, squeaking and grinding!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later: Is "individualism" a bad thing?&nbsp; We think most people probably equate "individualism" with "selfishness," but there may be a better way to think about this...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it with us, unless you're trying to transcend all thought.&nbsp; In which case:&nbsp; OMMMMmmmmmmm!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally: Please put some clothes on, Ladies.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the Peaches said "If you really believe a thing, it will lead to action. And the main thing stopping people from ACTING on their beliefs is fear/uncertainty."&nbsp; But... Pkarlgh sent an email with a possible exception involving masks at work, so we need to unpack this a bit more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next: this entire winter has been full of health trials for the Comedian's family. We thought having COVID in December would be the peak. But--no. We just can't shake the sickness around here.&nbsp; This leads us to notice how different individuals tend to struggle with different symptoms more than others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the connection between mind and body when you're suffering with both spiritual and physical symptoms?&nbsp; (Is it related to the different ways we're tempted to sin?)<br /><br />Let's talk about people who suffer well.&nbsp; Do they get to the point they actually suffer LESS than people who fall into the suffering spiral?&nbsp; Some people suffer greatly with anxiety about being laughed at.&nbsp; &nbsp;John doesn't struggle with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people want control, and so they stop eating. Other people want control, so they eat too much.&nbsp; What does the Peaches think about this?&nbsp; She doesn't know!</p>
<p>Finally: Our culture is very relativistic. Most people don't know what they're doing or where they're going. Church leaders are torn because they believe they're supposed to offer some sort of direction and hope--but they don't know how.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table of the Comedian Next Door, Neighbor Pkarlgh! We've taken away the video games and other screens, so the kids are playing ball in the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John recently realized there aren't many people in the Church today who are willing to be as bold and confident as Paul. Why is that?&nbsp; Are people afraid to speak the truth?... or do they even know what the truth is in the first place?</p>
<p>Peaches thinks most people struggle with uncertainties/doubts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some things aren't worth fighting about...&nbsp; But those aren't really "convictions."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been advising people to SHUT UP when they don't know what they're talking about.&nbsp; So, maybe that's why there are so few Pauls.&nbsp; Is it possible to will ourselves to know things?&nbsp; Can we CHOOSE to be more certain?</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor! The Peaches used to believe that every, single bad thing on the planet could be attributed to "selfishness." (And she still leans that direction.) But NOW she thinks absolutely every conflict boils down to a clash between the Truth and a lie.<br /><br />Lots and lots of people are really struggling to express themselves.&nbsp; We give two examples of comments from John's "critics." But, they're just collections of generic, angry-sounding words. To be a criticism, a thing needs to be clear and direct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are way too many empty words being thrown around.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you want some practice thinking and speaking more clearly? Try getting directions from a small child and then translating for him/her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of small children talking in childish ways, here's Silas to say a thing we don't totally understand at first!<br /><br />Three types of Liars:</p>
<p>1. Immature/Ignorant people with limited ability to express themselves.</p>
<p>2. Manipulators who INTENTIONALLY mislead with "word games."<br /><br />3. Smooth-talkers who want a certain reaction from you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to make a joke, you have to manipulate language and strategically mislead people...but then you reveal the truth with the punch line.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don't leave people in the dark on purpose! And don't say something you KNOW is only half-true, just to get the result you want. And don't do the "compliment sandwich" thing just because a Sales Guy told you to do it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Say true things.&nbsp;<br /><br />Email us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Please join us in praying a hedge of protection around the Comedian's recording equipment.&nbsp; Welcome to our table--where Tabby is just getting back from an appointment with her newborn, Warren. We're pretty sure this lip-tie surgery is going to cure ALL of his future ailments.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tabby hasn't had Facebook for over a year, so she hasn't seen our dad's recent posts.&nbsp; So, pull up a chair what while we fill her in on all the things we've been discussing on social media this week...<br /><br />Every time you laugh at a man dressed as a woman, a Trans Girl gets more afraid to come out!<br /><br />John agrees wholeheartedly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Laughter is a good way to determine whether you need to examine your beliefs for hidden stupidity.&nbsp; Humans don't decide what is funny; GOD decides what is funny.&nbsp;<br /><br />You can't punch down at people who refuse to view themselves as LESS THAN you are. (High five for cheeseburgers, everybody!)&nbsp;<br /><br />Later:&nbsp; the Peaches shares a dirty joke that was posted by a troll. But there's a point to giving this lewdness some air time! Technically, the joke is legit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then:&nbsp; a pastor has discovered that his girlfriend is pregnant...and his confession is similar to when one of our toddlers "discovers" that a sibling has been pinched, but he can't bring himself to state exactly HOW THAT HAPPENED.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is how spiritual infants speak.&nbsp;<br /><br />AND: John tells a story of a time he accidentally was insulted a friend with disabilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;This type of condescension (and treating people with low-expectations) is what many churches have been cultivating and calling "LOVE."&nbsp; &nbsp;This is making Church People "Spiritually Spoiled."&nbsp;<br /><br />Both believers and non-believers have been told they are "loved" so often that they are bursting with pride.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Finally: What does all of this have to do with increasing rates of suicide?&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The boys/men of the family just got back from eating "Man Food." Quick--let's talk about what made John laugh this week, before we dive into the INTERESTING stuff the Peaches wants to discuss.<br /><br />First of all, why are a bunch of irrelevant, old musicians picking a fight with Joe Rogan?&nbsp; Well--we want to announce (formally) that we're joining the boycott! Hopefully this earns us some attention, as it has done for Neil Young and Joni Mitchell.&nbsp;<br /><br />Next, what about Apple's new emoji of the "pregnant man?"&nbsp; &nbsp; And what about Minnie Mouse getting a wardrobe change?<br /><br />And isn't this podcast supposed to be FUNNY?<br /><br />Whenever we give examples of women doing unwise, sinful, or embarassing things, we use the pseudonym "Carlina" to keep their real names anonymous.&nbsp; &nbsp;Today's Carlina story involves Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion, plus some weird voodoo nonsense.&nbsp; We give several examples of comments that are barely coherent... just strange, spiritual-sounding blather.&nbsp;<br /><br />Spoilers:&nbsp; Carlina has a few creative edits for the Bible.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you just can't get enough of John Branyan Comedy, visit our website and consider BECOMING A MEMBER of the Comedy Clique!&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our table, Neighbor Pkarlgh.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Peaches is particularly thankful for spreadable butter today.&nbsp; Also--please enjoy this story about a misbehaving toddler and the lengths a mom/aunt must go to discipline those little humans.&nbsp;<br /><br />Are we being "petty" and "making a big deal out of nothing" when we forcibly remove the stolen deer jerky out of a child's mouth? Yes--the Bible says blessed are the peacemakers. But, how do we keep peace with rebellious sinners?<br /><br />That leads John to an example involving the man named Caitlyn Jenner. Conservatives are now quoting Jenner and believing he's on THEIR SIDE, simply because he sometimes says vaguely Right-Wing sounding things.&nbsp; &nbsp; They no longer care that Jenner is using FEMALE PRONOUNS to describe men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(* Brief Interuption while John breaks the recorder )</p>
<p>Bottom line: Don't be afraid to fight with a person who's wrong.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later: Is the Peaches the only one who thought the Babylon Bee's interview with Elon Musk was super awkward and not-that-profound?&nbsp; Why are people fawning over how "articulate" Elon Musk is?...&nbsp; Let's be honest:&nbsp; we are influenced by his riches and fame.&nbsp; Nobody would be quoting him otherwise.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you like being part of our conversations, visit johnbranyan.com and join the Comedy Clique for more exclusive content!&nbsp; Also tune in for John's LIVE show--The Starving Comics Quarantine Show--every Sunday at 7:00pm Eastern on the John Branyan youtube channel.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Comedian's house, where we spent the afternoon recording new intros/outros for your listening pleasure!&nbsp; The four McBabies complicated the process juuuuuust a bit.&nbsp; Write us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com to let us know what you think.&nbsp;<br /><br />Next, we've been discussing the problem with creating brand new content every, single day and never stopping to promote or share the content with a wider audience.&nbsp; Most people are intimidated by a blank page and a blinking cursor. But John PREFERS to start from scratch every time he sits down at his computer.&nbsp; &nbsp;He hates having to say the same thing more than once.&nbsp;<br /><br />Has he written/spoken millions of words?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Has he written BILLIONS?&nbsp; Well, apparently that would be almost impossible...&nbsp; We spend a long time debating this.<br /><br />But--the point it: we believe God gives us the ability to communicate, and we want to be good stewards of our resource.&nbsp; The observations, devotionals, jokes, and blog posts that John wrote ten years ago are still gifts from God that we can share today!&nbsp; &nbsp;...even if we'd rather say something "new and fresh."<br /><br />To drive the point home, the Peaches reads some of John's old jokes that he DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER WRITING.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Later:&nbsp; sometimes we get angry emails from people who don't know how to unsubscribe from the John Branyan website...&nbsp; Somehow, this discussion leads to contacting a famous friend and blaming him for a personal problem.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally:&nbsp; We give a quick update on the World's Dumbest Woman--which is actually a character we've created named "Pkarlina." (Pronounced "Carlina.")&nbsp; What's she up to now?&nbsp; Well, she divorced her husband and started dating the world's most vulgar, irresponsible man... and all her church friends are SO happy for her!<br /><br />Enjoy our new outro, Neighbor Pkarlgh!&nbsp; Follow John Branyan on YouTube and Facebook, and we'll see you next time!&nbsp; (Poop.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table of the Comedian Next Door. When you're here, we affectionately call you "Neighbor Pkarlgh."&nbsp; The Comedian's family is gearing up for a Christmas-and-New-Year's hybrid celebration, and we have a lot of preparations to make. But first, let's talk about the sin of speaking without thinking carefully first...&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you noticed that many, many people take their ability to communicate for granted?&nbsp; Too often, they say things they don't actually mean because they don't THINK about the words they're using.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p>When the Bible warns against unwholesome talk or filthy language, we don't think it's only talking about 4-letter words. What about carelessly saying "God bless you" when someone sneezes?&nbsp; Or carelessly saying "Amen" in response to a worldly opinion?&nbsp; &nbsp;If you make a habit of speaking without thinking, you might end up praising the name of Lauren Daigle! (You'll just have to listen to the episode to understand that reference, Neighbor Pkarlgh.)<br /><br />By the way, it's cold today. But it's not as cold as it could be...<br /><br />Support John's comedy by visiting johnbranyan.com!</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Being Jerks and Mama Aint Happy (Festive Du-Dunting) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/09db53d6-115a-4d6f-82d9-bcef73561ffa/tcnd-being-jerks-and-mama-aint-happy-festive-du-dunting.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're trying to cut down on the microphone clunking, Neighbor. Let us know how that's going. Also, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas at the Comedian's house! Unfortunately, we can't think of very many good words to describe it… So let's get down to business talking about whether Christians should be jerks!</p>



<p>Nobody actually thinks being a jerk is a good thing. But, sometimes, comedians say things they don't mean, to help make a point. The Peaches isn't convinced that John made his point very well this time. But, luckily, she was there to help prompt a better dialog in the comment section! (You can follow John Branyan on Facebook, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JohnBranyanComedy/posts/430276975207819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read the post in question</a> for yourself.)</p>



<p>Next, someone on Telegram thanked us for talking about women's sins and pointing out examples of Feminism taking over the church. He said there aren't any other people (to his knowledge) that are covering this topic as solidly as we do. SO, we've got another example for your consideration today.</p>



<p>Do Christians tend to take a mom's side so completely that they will even call her kids "crazy" when they disagree with her story? That's pretty insulting toward the kids, isn't it?</p>



<p>And, what happens when you try to point out this phenomenon on social media in a thread where a bunch of women are sharing their testimonies of having their adult children turned against them by evil, abusive fathers? Well, if you stand up for the adult children, you will get a bunch of angry-reacts from the moms. This prompts the Peaches to say this: "In America in 2021, the people who are using their ANGER to control their family members are not usually the fathers. They are the moms loudly announcing when Mama Ain't Happy."</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor! The Podcast Ninja (Luke) shot a deer.  Silas wants a quesadilla. And we've been decorating for Christmas...  After all of that, we get busy talking about WHATEVER WE WANT, because we can draw connections with any two ideas if we think about it long enough! (Send us your suggestions for two seemingly-unrelated topics. We will tell you how to make them connect. It'll be fun.)

There’s a meme that sometimes makes the rounds saying, “People will provoke you until they bring out your ugly side—and then play the victim because you went there!”   John says it’s never appropriate to display your “ugly side”—especially if you’re going to blame others for your behavior. That’s what prisoners with criminal mindsets do.  Before we share a quote like this one, we should ask ourselves if we still agree with the sentiment when it gets spoken by someone we don't like...

Sidenote: if you can't see things from another person's perspective, you won't be able to make comedy.  You need to know what people think the truth is--and you also need to know what the ACTUAL truth is--so you can reveal where the absurdities lie. It's silly to say that it's okay to be an abuser as long as someone else abused you first.  Two wrongs don't make a right!

Later: we have another story to share, but how can we make them connect? 

We unpack a small scandal in the Pro-Life community.  (Click to visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/abbyjohnsonprolife/posts/434552274695663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abby Johnson's Facebook post </a>that we reference.) What should we do when someone tells a story that makes a GREAT pro-Life message, but the details can't be verified?  What if the woman starts a non-profit and asks for donations and travels the country to share her testimony, but there are doubts about her story?    And, most importantly: why would a person claim there's a police report to prove her claim, but she shouldn't have to share it?...

Thanks for visiting today, Neighbor Pkarlgh! Remember to write to nextdoor@johnbranyan.com with your suggestions for random topics that would be difficult to relate with each other.

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Blunt Talk with Family (Stinky Feet) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/25ddf8da-3265-4853-96cb-7a8d175749a0/tcnd-blunt-talk-with-family-stinky-feet.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table, Neighbor Pkarlgh!  The ladies in our family get together once a week for "Just Because I Love You Day," and this time John is crashing the hen party.  So, we're recording two podcasts at the same time.  On the mics: John, Peaches (Amanda), Megan, and Tabby.  (You can find the Four Sisters' podcast, Just Because I Love You, by clicking this link:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4JRPgFcJV1xmZKO7MXhd1C">https://open.spotify.com/show/4JRPgFcJV1xmZKO7MXhd1C</a> )</p>



<p>There are twice the number of children usually in the background, so please bear with their happy chatter.</p>



<p>On the mics: John, Peaches (Amanda), Megan, and Tabby.</p>



<p>First of all, John's feet smell terrible and Megan had to intervene.</p>



<p>Next, we read an email from a Pkarlgh who wants to know if we've ever caused bridges to be burned in our own family by being too blunt. JUST KIDDING! First John interrupts with a different email about how awesome our podcast is.</p>



<p>Okay, THEN we read the letter asking how we navigate those tricky/sticky subjects when we're interacting with close relationships rather than random internet trolls. Are John and Peaches nicer on the internet or in person?  Do we tone down the rhetoric to spare the feelings of our loved ones?</p>

--Self-Deprecation

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor!  Sorry for the technical glitch in the intro. No idea what's going on there. 

John just came back from St. Louis, where he was hanging out with Tim Hawkins' family.   They recorded a podcast which will get published next week and involves important conversation about grapes. NO SPOILERS! You'll just have to listen when it's available. 

Also: tune in Wednesday, because we've got a HOUSEGUEST in the form of the Babylon Bee's managing editor, Joel Berry. 

And now the moment you've all been waiting for... Introducing PKARGHLINA! (Pronounced: Carlina)  Anytime we want to share a true story of a woman doing something foolish, we call that woman "Pkarghlina."   Sometimes she has babies with five different men.  Sometimes she calls herself Mama Bear and wastes the time of the police.  It doesn't matter what Pkarghlina's real name is.  What matters is the behavior that should be avoided.   

We're writing modern day morality tales over here, Neighbor!  Don't be a fox...or a Pkarghlina. 

Finally, we talk more about empathy vs sympathy, because Doug Wilson reacted to a cartoon on the subject. The Peaches had already seen the cartoon before, because it was assigned as part of the curriculum for becoming a Birth Doula.  In a culture that encourages everyone to stop judging and keep FEELING, no wonder Pkarlghina is so confused.

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Money Won’t Educate and Empathetic Witches (Truth Stickers) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/6a3b805d-42b0-44d1-a4f6-c60f9dd9f35a/tcnd-money-wont-educate-and-empathetic-witches-truth-stickers.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, neighbor! If you're listening, we call you "Pkarlgh."</p>



<p>It's another challenging day in Homeschool Land. Shockingly, when you set out to educate your children, it's not all smiling faces and photo ops. Lots of people think they can solve this problem by throwing another trillion dollars at the public school system--to reward the "good teachers" who are trying to get 8-year-olds to stop writing more wrong answers before you've finished erasing the first one…</p>



<p>John thinks there are actually people in the world who WANT to educate their own kids, but the Peaches thinks the word "want" isn't quite accurate. Nobody WANTS to kill their flesh daily.</p>



<p>Only self-sacrificial love will motivate someone to keep marching down the Parenting Path, on really hard days like today.</p>



<p>Cami is making banana pancakes in the background, so please allow for a few important recipe-related interruptions.</p>



<p>Next, apparently some people think we need to water the deserts until they become forests…</p>



<p>Also, someone asks John for his credentials when it comes to "the ability to certify Truth."</p>



<p>Finally, we get around to talking about Christian people who identify as "Empaths," not realizing it's a concept related to the New Age Occult. John didn't even realize how relevant this topic is, despite the Peaches telling him that pretty much every woman on Instagram is bragging about her "Empathic" ability to "feel other people's energy" as soon as they walk into a room.</p>



<p>People who hang around on "trauma support groups" and read books about "surviving narcissists" are absolutely steeped in this spiritual-sounding garbage. They're being told they HAVE to be selfish and protect themselves from abusers, because they are tender-hearted saints while everyone around them is a horrible sinner.</p>



<p>Let us know if you need a shower after this episode, Neighbor! Grab a crystal ball and two candles and follow us to the weird part of the internet.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're here at the kitchen table with a neighborhood celebrity--our FLF brother--Adam "AD" Robles.
To kick off, we joke about not knowing what we're supposed to be talking about. Except, it's not really a joke, and we literally don't know what we're talking about…</p>



<p>Eventually, we find our rhythm and dissect the way "Evangelical" leadership has failed to defend itself against Cancel Culture. (Hello, Josh McDowell!) But maybe the falling away of cowardly pastors is a blessing in disguise?…</p>



<p>In this episode, we cover:
-AD's massive network of executive staff
-Why John's podcast is boring
-How Josh McDowell cancelled HIMSELF
-Should Christians be FEARED in the culture?
-Should parents be FEARED by their children?
-Feminism permeates the culture, including churches
-How Evangelicals regularly misjudge the cultural moment
-Plus, Pkarlgh (our listener) gets a suave new Spanish nickname!</p>



<p>"If Josh McDowell could not stand up to the woke Everything-Is-Racist mob, then maybe it's time for him to step aside. The last think that Evangelicalism needs is ANOTHER person who won't stand up to paganism and evil ideologies. So, he shouldn't have done it; he shouldn't have resigned. But, since he's the type of guy who would resign--good!" --AD Robles</p>



<p>"Evangelicalism has made it an artform of preaching the sermon that does not need to be preached right now…" --AD Robles</p>



<p>Bonus: Why AD is grateful for Transgenders at Hooters.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Comedian's house, Neighbor Pkarlgh! If you don't want to spend a long time shooting the breeze about Japanese food, we apologize in advance. ....</p>
<p>John published a post about "Peacemaking" this week, and the Peaches wasn't impressed with his delivery. It was a bit rambly and unorganized. Buuuuut, there were some strong points. Here's the private message John received: "I do have to ask, have you become a Facebook troll? Hahaha! It's funny. But you seem to donate your opinions, many of which I also agree. But they are unsolicited. As I am tempted to throw my two-cents into a Facebook thread, I am also reminded that 'blessed are the peacemakers.' Are you helping to keep the peace?" This is a perfectly reasonable question! But, sometimes comedians aren't very nuanced when they have a point to make. There are two issues with this private message. #1. Private messages are like dragging someone out of the townsquare into a dark alley, where there are no witnesses, so you can confront them. #2. The definition of "peacemaking" in the Western church is a bit messed up. Unfortunately, too many people want to jusify their cowardice by calling themselves "peacemakers." But Peacemaking isn't refusing to fight; it's fighting the RIGHT PEOPLE... Send us an email: nextdoor@johnbranyan.com, Thanks for laughing with us, Neighbor!</p>]]></description>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/650f8bbc-8cb6-4e88-8793-4e174f864e16/tcnd-self-love-for-me-not-thee-family-feud.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our house, Neighbor! We're not over-exaggerating when we say John and the Peaches aren't seeing completely eye-to-eye on this episode. Be prepared for a little bickering...

A listener weighs in on a recent episode.  Do teachers WANT their students to be as offended as possible?</p>



<p> The Peaches disagrees with both John and the Neighbor who sent us this email.  </p>



<p>Many, many, many Tik-Tok, Instagram influencers claim they were raised by parents who didn't LOVE them enough, and it caused them to have low self-esteem. (Their parents were selfish.) So, they think the solution is to LOVE THEMSELVES in ways their parents never did.  In other words: they want to become as self-focused and self-absorbed as their parents were.  

Eventually, the Peaches brings up the Golden Rule, and that's where things start to go off the rails.  What happens when people start reading the Bible for OTHERS instead of applying it to themselves?... Well, it doesn't work.   (We agree about that.)  But John thinks it's possible to take the Golden Rule too far...? Or something?...   And then we have to talk about BDSM, so it gets weird. 
Sorry, Neighbor. 

We unnecessarily complicated this whole thing. 

But, bottom line:  We think there are parents and teachers out there who selfishly train up children to be THEIR PERSONAL SERVANTS; they are raising kids to be part of a world that revolves around THEM...    

Finally, the Peaches whirls about whether you can respect an idea or belief that you disagree with.  Why is this so hard for people to grasp?!?!?!

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We've got a HOUSEGUEST at the Kitchen Table today: our friend and educator, Chris "Shoof" Scheufele. Chris travels the country giving talks to students about how to be emotionally resilient. Recently, he delivered a speech at a new school that went GREAT! Everyone laughed, they clapped, and they wanted to have him come back again soon… Well, ALMOST everyone…</p>



<p>We talk about the way a small minority of offended teachers can control the entire school. Why does the principal allow this to happen? How can Christians stand up to Cancel Culture? And is Chris interested in joining a group of Christian allies who will stand up for him whenever he's attacked by humorless nincompoops?</p>



<p>All this and more in today's HOUSEGUEST episode!</p>



<p>You can find Chris at chrisintheclassroom.com and on Facebook on the "Chris in the Classroom" page.</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Just Shut Up (Facebook Down) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/da8d78bc-792b-4fc3-bc10-8b9e9e8ebc49/tcnd-just-shut-up-facebook-down.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor Pkarlgh! We decided to record a podcast in the middle of the Facebook Outage, because we thought it might be headline news for longer than 10 minutes...  John talked to his Computer Coding Genius friend who gave us some insider information on why the whole system went down for the longest blackout in the platform's history.

THEN, we give an update about the Speeding Ticket Lady from last week's episode about toxic femininity.  (Spoiler: she still has dozens of people encouraging her bad behavior.)

NEXT, too many people just KEEP TALKING when they're upset, which only makes everything worse.  If folks would learn to SHUT UP until their strong emotions pass, the world would be a better place.   We understand that sometimes you feel like venting! And sometimes you make mistakes and get frustrated with yourself and others.  But it's better to JUST SHUT UP. 

FINALLY, the Peaches reads one of her old blog posts (from 2010) about how you should NEVER say "shut up" to anyone. Her tirade is pretty funny in light of the title of this episode...   But, at the time, it was a serious argument she had with her new husband.  As much as she didn't appreciate being told to shut up, it turned out to be decent advice.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Peaches didn't write a proper summary for this episode, Neighbor.</p>



<p>Here are the bare basics: our culture finds it much easier to identify and call out "toxic masculinity" than to recognize when WOMEN are being toxic. So--today we're talking about sinful female behavior (with examples from social media).</p>



<p>But, before all of that, we share a plan for how to handle our new Serial Scam Caller next time he rings the Comedy Business Phone with a thick Hindi accent…</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're at the kitchen table with good friend and ventriloquist, David Pendleton--but DON'T CALL HIM DAVE! 

If you've never listened to a conversation with David before, you won't know that he's an expert on German Baptist theology.  (It's a long story, Neighbor Pkarlgh. But you can listen to the German Baptist episode of the Comedy Sojourn by clicking here: <a href="https://branyancomedy.libsyn.com/podcast/scandals-forgiveness-foot-washing-and-german-baptists" data-type="URL" data-id="https://branyancomedy.libsyn.com/podcast/scandals-forgiveness-foot-washing-and-german-baptists">Scandals, Forgiveness, Foot-washing, and German Baptists</a> )</p>



<p>Today, David gives just a brief description of the baptism ceremony in the German Baptist community--and then we're able to seque nicely into talking about a DIFFERENT kind of fundamentalism which is infecting the culture... That is, Woke Fundamentalism. </p>



<p>David has been a staff member at Campus Crusade for Christ since the mid-80's, and he has an insider's perspective to share regarding the recent criticism of (and subsequent apology from) Josh McDowell. David's testimony may or may not include examples from Cru's internal message boards.</p>



<p>This is an extended episode detailing how a once strong, faithful organization can become infiltrated by unChristian ideas in a relatively short amount of time.</p>



<p>"Here's the important narrative here… if you say that a certain group of people do not have equal opportunity, you cannot then attribute it to something that is true within their culture. You always have to attribute it to [being] because they have been victimized." --David Pendleton</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We have SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT, Neighbor!</p>



<p>Tune in next Wednesday for our houseguest episode with David Pendleton with some BREAKING CULTURAL NEWS. There’s a scandal related to a respected Christian institution, and you probably aren’t even aware of it, yet. But that’s why you listen to the Comedian Next Door! So you can be “in the know.”</p>



<p>Next, John wants to get to the mail—but he has to suffer the Peaches’ sound effects first. (He was so proud of that Mouth Honk last week, and now, suddenly, it’s a burden...)</p>



<p>Our listener, Pkarlgh, writes to us from Canada using plenty of commas and making several observations about the sad state of our culture. She closes with a question about what to call “healthcare” when it’s being controlled by tyrannical professionals who hold political grudges. We have some suggestions, of course.
Later, John has a quote from G.K. Chesterton. But it takes awhile for him to read it because we enlist the help of the Podcast Ninja (Luke) to demonstrate a perfect British accent.</p>



<p>Eventually, John shares the quote:
“[Jesus] restrained something… I say it with reverence that there was, in this shattering personality, a thread that must be called shyness. There was something He hid from all men when he went up a mountain to pray. There was something that he covered constantly by abrupt silence or impetuous isolation. There was one thing that was too great for God to show us when He walked upon our earth. And I have sometimes fancied that it was his mirth.”</p>



<p>We don’t want to disagree with the famous Theologian. Buuuuut… we’re not sure why he assumes Jesus wasn’t mirthful.
And that’s just the first 15 minutes! We spend the rest of this long-winded episode mildly chastising the Focus on the Family initiative to “Take Your Bible To School.” We propose: take your school to CHURCH and stop trying to sprinkle a little bit of Jesus on top of your secular education…</p>



<p>We have much more to say about godless, Secular Humanist education and the public school system. Join the conversation! </p>



<p>And, if you want to send us your comments and questions, write to: nextdoor@johnbranyan.com!</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Dignity and Rollercoasters (Mouth Honk) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/42f9f8dc-7404-4cb3-a30e-74312d9822f7/tcnd-dignity-and-rollercoasters-mouth-honk.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome, Pkarlgh! The birthday party prep is in full swing, and 5-year-old Emery was given the best chore ever!  </p>



<p>This reminds John of a new segment idea:  Is This a Joke?!  As the culture continues to swim in irrationality, there are a lot of things happening that would have been considered unbelievable 20 years ago...  For example: Atheist chaplains and women who put their sons in dresses and then complain that they're being bullied...  Is this a joke?

Related: John is very proud of the new sound he can make with his mouth. Let us know if you're as impressed as he is, by emailing nextdoor@johnbranyan.com .  

Finally, it's mail time! How can we be respectful toward our bodies as temples and have dignity as Christians made in God's image--while we're laughing at everything?  

It's a good question, Pkarlgh!  We should want to be mature...responsible...respectable...and to maintain a human dignity.  However--we shouldn't be too preoccupied with being SEEN as very grown up.  C.S. Lewis has a great quote about our quest for maturity. </p>



<p>Shout out to Tony and Joseph on the Patriarchy Podcast! They're our network brothers on Fight, Laugh, Feast... Then we spend waaaaaay too long trying to think of a synonym for "frivolous."</p>



<p>Don't forget: A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men. --Roald Dahl
The most dignified parts of this podcast have--by far--been the most boring.</p>



<p>And what does Cami's experience on a roller coaster have to do with struggling to be dignified?</p>



<p>Finally, we wrap up with a quick Whirl from the Peaches. Christians have historically been very Libertarian-leaning. (Small government, free markets, etc.) But we don't live in a moral society anymore. We can't value "free choice" at all costs--when our neighbors are "choosing" to kill babies. And we can't value free enterprise at all costs, when pagan corporations are censoring Christian thought…

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/572bf529-08ed-463f-b2da-c26c00c4719c/tcnd-duck-suck-and-the-other-word-flf-conference-recap.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor! When you're hanging out at the Comedian's house, we affectionately call you "Pkarlgh."  So welcome, Pkarlgh.</p>



<p>We're just getting back from the Fight Laugh Feast Conference, literally minutes before recording, and John is sporting some stylish new Ear Gear.  How comfortable are his new headphones?...  Well... the Peaches gives the best description she can muster. 

Hard consonants are funny, Pkarlgh. That's your free advice from the professional today. 

And speaking of funny words, please wish Collin "good well" on his 8th birthday. Feel free to ask if you can share some of his lollipop or soda.  We'll know whether you listened to this episode if you use the special phrase! 

After we talk about "duck" and "suck," we discover there is another relevant word, used by an angry Feminist when addressing unvaccinated individuals.    The Podcast Ninja (Luke) shared his favorite take-away from the Conference: tyranny happens incrementally, through hundreds of tiny compromises.  Long story very short, THAT'S why we find our culture suddenly being bullied into compliance by Mama Bears who are PROUD to use emotional manipulation on Facebook. 

Whoops, pause for a second, Pkarlgh! The Peaches needs to update the official outro, now that the FLF Conference is over.  Now what do you think of the new one? (We especially hope you enjoy the contribution from 3-year-old Silas.)

Please send any comments or questions to nextdoor@johnbranyan.com.  Follow the John Branyan channel on YouTube and watch the Starving Comics Quarantine Show  LIVE every Sunday night at 7:00pm Eastern. (Comments left during the LIVE stream can be featured in the show!)

If you're not a Club Member in the Fight Laugh Feast Network already, what's wrong with you?!  Sign up at flfnetwork.com, and you can get caught up on the talks that were given at the conference this weekend!</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We don't know what we're talking about today, Neighbor Pkarlghl! But that never stops us from filling 45 minutes with meandering conversation...

Emmi (5-years-old) treats us to a very quiet recitation of "The Elephant."  Then we get ready to open the mailbag. (But first--a quick plug for the Fight Laugh Feast Conference.  John says we'll be recording the next episode live at the conference, and hopefully that's true!)

This week, someone mistook John's youngest daughter, Tabby, for his wife. (Awkward.)   And someone else named their computer "Pkarlgh" in honor of this podcast. (Awesome!) 

Then the Peaches' is asked for an update about the vaccine mandate being imposed on her husband, who's a registered nurse.  Luke was granted a religious exemption, and the Peaches shares the details about the scathing letter they wrote and gave to the hospital.   

Healthcare is a mess right now! Good employees are being fired (or walking out), and the leadership teams are panicking.  Facebook groups of angry healthcare workers are being blown off the internet. What a time to be alive!

Then John asks, "Why do administrators think they can just be nasty--and bare their teeth--and then people will do what they want?" And the answer is…unfortunately, because that DOES work sometimes. This leads to a conversation about Christians being bullied into deleting things off the internet.   </p>



<p>Later, Rick Warren said the best way to love your neighbor in this era is to wear a mask.   John has some thoughts about that.   And the Peaches thinks people on both sides of the debate are actually afraid they might be wrong...

Thank you to the Fight Laugh Feast Network for hosting us--and thank you to Subsplash for sponsoring the app.  </p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We are laaaaaate, Neighbor Pkarlgh! It has been a busy weekend at Vacay with Comics. (And, also, our microphones weren't turned up…but that may have been a smaller percentage of the problem.) Vacay was a success, despite Luke and Joe trying to ruin our reputation with alcohol. </p>



<p>Completely unplanned, both John and The Peaches are talking about Parents With Problems. First, a father of two kids is "NOT OKAY" (his words, not ours), because the pandemic is cramping his style. It turns out, he can't really decide whether he wants his kids to go back to public school or he wants to keep them home, safe, where they are driving him crazy.</p>



<p>Then, John reads a post from a mother of a newborn who is also NOT OKAY. (Our words, not hers.) She is afraid the new baby will get sick, so she won't let anyone hold him…including the big brothers and sisters.</p>



<p>The Peaches reads a post she wrote on this subject long before the COVID circus. Excerpt:</p>



<p>"PLEASE, please don't believe the lie that you can prevent tragedies if you refuse to let your babies be kissed or snuggled. Please don't demand that everyone within 20 miles get flu shots, or they will be eaten by Mama Bear. Please don't threaten to rip apart families over a pacifier that didn't get sterilized. And please--please--don't isolate yourself from family and friends out of fear that they'll contaminate your baby. Because…
THIS DOESN'T PREVENT TRAGEDY--It'S ACTUALLY A SICKNESS OF ITS OWN."</p>



<p>We would love to hear from you, Pkarlgh! Email us as nextdoor@johnbranyan.com to weigh in. Also, it's not too late to visit with us at the Fight Laugh Feast Conference, September 9th - 11th. Details at flfnetwork.com.</p>]]></description>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/133ce470-4b98-4ac9-93ae-a712a75560c5/tcnd-houseguests-juan-and-melodee-devevo-of-casting-crowns.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table, Neighbor Pkarlgh! Our houseguests are physically in the house with us, for once.  Normally, when Juan and Melodee are in town, we selfishly keep them all to ourselves, and we talk and play games without recording anything. </p>



<p>But, today, we're sharing a portion of our conversation about speaking TRUTH without lacking LOVE.  (This is one of Juan's favorite topics.)</p>



<p>"I've given a lot of thought to this Truth and Love debate that we're all having… One of my favorite authors is CS Lewis, and he says the enemy always introduces errors into the world in pairs of opposites…" -Juan DeVevo</p>



<p>Can we think of examples of speaking Truth -without- love?
And what do Harriet the Spy and Rosie O'Donnell have to do with this?</p>



<p>Plus: the Peaches tells the DeVevos about a "gender non-binary" Kindergarden teacher who is brainwashing 5-year-olds in a nearby town. While Christians have been agonizing over whether they're loving enough, the culture has been taken over by crazies who have no problem telling your children they can be "LGBT kiddos."</p>



<p>You can see Juan and Melodee on the Casting Crowns Drive-In Tour. Details at castingcrowns.com.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table of The Comedian Next Door! </p>



<p>John is sporting some stylish new tech equipment that you'll just have to imagine.   </p>



<p>We have three, separate pieces of mail to read--the most important of which declares THE PEACHES WAS RIGHT about something.   But, also, John's comedy could cure generations of insomnia, according to a certain critic.  If you think you can do a better job insulting John, then send your attempts to Nextdoor@johnbranyan.com.   (Keep in mind, the Peaches prefers the "Kill Them With Kindness" approach.)   The harder you swing, the more pathetic your attempts to hurt another person are...   The Peaches invites you to agree with her!

Don't miss our Houseguest episode releasing this Wednesday!  We'll have Juan and Melodee DeVevo, of Casting Crowns, to discuss education, culture, and the Kindergarten teacher who identifies as NEITHER "Miss nor Mister." 

Finally, John reads an article from a non-christian comedian who has noticed the way Cancel Culture is affecting the comedy world.  When the author was attacked by the LGBT mob, he received private messages of support, saying he did nothing wrong. But--publicly--nobody defended him.  

"There are lessons here that go well beyond comedy.  While the vast majority of my readers, even the Canadian ones, have never heard of [this Trans Comedian], or the rest of her clique, the examples show...tiny groups of enforcers can poison an entire artistic subculture, despite these enforcers' lack of any real commercial success..."    (Full article here: https://quillette.com/2021/08/01/life-as-a-stand-up-comic-can-be-brutal-safe-space-call-out-culture-is-making-it-unbearable/)

In other words, a person who's not even a FUNNY COMEDIAN can somehow influence the entire culture. </p>



<p>Never, ever ask a woman or couple if they're planning to have children...  Never, ever, ever, ever ask certain questions.  The Enforcers have spoken! 

Being afraid to speak what's on your mind will affect the entire Comedy Industry and the rest of society. 

We'll see you at the Fight Laugh Feast Conference, Neighbor!

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/90fc74ba-ee31-4e48-b45e-13ed91805ce4/tcnd-john-doesnt-want-fans-lobsters-and-crabs.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor Pkarlgh! As you probably don't know, John has a Dry Bar special which periodically goes viral on social media and doesn't impact his career in the least. </p>



<p>Be careful if you think you want tons of followers on social media! Trust us when we say, climbing to the "next level" of internet popularity isn't what it's cracked up to be.</p>



<p>This leads to a possible opportunity for the Peaches to be in a Whirl about something. (But we're not sure.) (And also, John sounds like his nose is stuffed up.)  Eventually, he clears his sinuses enough to read a social media post from a woman who doesn't think her child's father needs to be praised for "simple" things like changing diapers and washing bottles.</p>



<p>Why do some people focus obsessively on how much or how little encouragment is being given to them BY STRANGERS? We spend the majority of the conversation discussing the reasons you shouldn't tear others down to make yourself feel better, nor should you fool yourself into believing that others are happier because their efforts are recognized more than your own.</p>



<p>Finally--does anyone know whether lobsters ACTUALLY step on each others back to get out of buckets? Email us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com to solve this mystery.</p>



<p>Subscribe to the John Branyan channel on YouTube and watch the Starving Comics Quarantine Show LIVE every Sunday evening at 7:00pm Eastern. Become a Comedy Clique member for exclusive content. (Details at johnbranyan.com) And, finally, have your pets spayed and neutered.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Peaches is pretty distracted, as it's almost lunchtime and the whole family is gathering after church. 

John reads some mail from a Neighbor who regrets learning how comedy is made...  Sometimes accepting the truth requires a full grief cycle. 

Next, John shares a quote from a preacher asking for help engaging the young families who have started coming to his church.  (Specifically, the preacher wants "doctrinally sound" videos and other resources to share with the newcomers.)   Why is John being so hyper-critical this week?!    John's point:  church leaders already should have doctrinally sound resources in their possession--whether they have new families visiting or not.   Amanda's point:  many church leaders have been told it's right and proper to defer to "the experts" when it comes to dispensing resources. 

We live in a culture that values outsourced knowledge more than homemade tools. For whatever reason, we think it lends a certain credibility when we can share a well-produced video made by SOMEONE ELSE, rather than creating something of our own. 

Pause.  John needs to go get a drink before he chokes to death. 

Okay, now he wants the Peaches to tell the story of the tomato in the toaster.  But first, we need to pause again to retrieve the pizza. 

When we finally resume recording again, it has been a couple of hours. (We can't keep secrets from you, Pkarlgh!) But we eventually get around to discussing the tomato in the toaster.  Collin, who's seven-years-old, is starting to show signs of maturity, and we are optimistic he's going to be a free-thinking adult some day!    This reminds us of great advice from Pastor Doug Wilson: give your kids FEWER rules.  Make the principles broad, and trust the children to be smart enough to reason for themselves. 

And that's pretty much a wrap, Pkarlgh!   Make sure you visit johnbranyan.com for information about Vacay with Comics. This is the LAST WEEK to register.

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/456db8f3-5a08-47d1-a081-246a315a75a5/tcnd-houseguest-jesse-sumpter.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Today, we're talking all things "education" with Jesse Sumpter!    Parents have a responsibility to educate their children--but too many of us are abdicating our roles to the nearest government school building and hoping a Christian disciple emerges in 12 years. 

We are so excited to pick Jesse's brain about how to inspire fellow Christians to band together and build a school that impacts the Kingdom. 

Quotes from this episode: 

"We want freedom to educate our children how we want to, as Christians, and we want to do that in obedience to God's word."  

"The first foundation of all good teaching is to tell the truth...and that is fundamentally at odds with the government school system." </p>



<p>"To convince people of a new thing, you can give them literature and give them books--you can have thoughtful conversations with them--but the other way of getting through to people is just saying, 'Come and see.'   We're humans.  We're embodied people, we have to see it sometimes for ourselves..."

PLUS, a story about a flat tire AND why Jesse is worried (and also not worried) about artificial intelligence. 

Jesse is teaching a virtual class called "Education is Warfare: How to Start a School" on the Fight Laugh Feast network. Visit flfnetwork.com for more details.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Tabby is at the table today. She's John's OTHER daughter (and the Peaches' sister). Good luck figuring out which voice belongs to which sister.  We kick off the conversation with an email letting John know there was a sliiiiiiight problem with his 3-minute devotionals this week.  (Oops.)  Then--the Peaches shares an excerpt from a self-help book about how nothing is okay and everything sucks. 

Somehow, this leads nicely into an audio clip featuring Robin DiAngelo, who explains that you can joke about white people...but you can't joke about people of color, because they're "different."   Peaches gets John's reaction to that opinion.  </p>



<p>All of this is punctuated by Kid Noises and general familial interruptions. 

What does it mean when comedians talk about "punching up" or "punching down"...and why does John want to attach extra prepositions to the end of those terms?    </p>



<p>How have so many Jewish people mastered the art of comedy?   Why can't worship leaders laugh at themselves?  What are some good insults to use on Tabby?  All of this and more!

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John reads some mail at the beginning of this episode. (Send your questions and comments to nextdoor@johnbranyan.com)  
One listeners calls us out for our use of the word "rhetoric" as if it's always bad, even though rhetoric CAN be used for good purposes.  That's a fair complaint, Neighbor!   You should always feel free to push back when we don't treat a topic fairly... </p>



<p>Then we jump into the Peaches In a Whirl segment because the Peaches truly is in a whirl this week! She even admits it! There are so many examples of people doing and saying dumb things this week that we don't have time to cover them all.  People just want to be told pretty lies, and they decide what to believe based on who compliments them.   Why are so many people openly admitting they don't care what you think...they only care how you make them feel?</p>



<p>An astounding number of people (who would call themselves Christians) actually have a fundamentally different religion than we do. All the talk about support and encouragement and compassion and love is coming from a worldview that is the OPPOSITE of Christ-centeredness. </p>



<p>Would the Christians you know even recognize the problem with a non-believer saying, "You have restored my faith in humanity!"  Or would they accept that as a nice compliment and assume they are doing a good job spreading the Gospel?</p>



<p>Your epistemology matters, Pkarlgh!  Don't be dumb!</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We have a Houseguest at the table today: Nathan Hunter! He is an avid reader, a fair-minded conversationalist, and a student of the history of Critical Race Theory.  All of this makes him smarter than approximatley 99% of the people he meets on the internet.  If he wants to engage people on social media, he's going to need to dumb things down A LOT!</p>



<p>Nathan explains he wants to help people think on a deeper level--but he's just not great at shaming and attacking people. That's where we can help!</p>



<p>The Peaches invites Nathan to share his background/credentials. But he's not sure he has researched enough, yet.   He wants to jump into the conversation and argue IDEAS--but he's waaaaaay too thoughtful to play the role of the Troll.</p>



<p>Welcome to the Comedian's House!

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor Pkarlgh!  We're kicking off with John's favorite kind of mail: the kind which says he's under-rated! (Email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com to send us your glowing reviews.) </p>



<p>
On today's "Good Grief" segment, the Peaches shares a sad/funny story about her Grandma with Alzheimer's.    Laughter and pain are inextricably connected! Can we hold both of those feelings at the same time? </p>



<p>Next--the Peaches is in a whirl about a village in Africa which is supposedly functioning as a "Matriarchal Society."  Western women want to smash the Patriarchy.... but would that really look any different than what we currently have in the United States?  If Hilary Clinton wants to hand out made-up awards to women who are getting pregnant and intentionally raising their children without fathers, she could start a little closer to home!</p>



<p>Finally, we talk about sandwiches and frozen lasagnas and recapping some of the Facebook drama John dredged up during Pride month.  (Sometimes people are Internet Trolls by accident, and we give you a handy trick to figure out whether you're dealing with a Troll or with a person who genuinely wants a conversation.)</p>



<p>
If you don't want the answer to the question, Pkarlgh, don't ask it...

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Arresting Pastors, Child-Hating Karens (Biproduct of Intercourse) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/4dca2b22-cfc7-472e-8535-33a0f2081349/tcnd-arresting-pastors-child-hating-karens-biproduct-of-intercourse.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>We tackle three distinct questions in this episode:  What's funny about pastors getting arrested?  Can you be bald and have sin in your heart?  And...what have you MADE to make the planet better?  (Don't say "my kids," Pkarlgh! Apparently that's the wrong answer.) 

First up, we teach you how to spell your own name, Pkarlgh, in case we haven't explained that already...

Next, John explains that laughing DURING a tragedy isn't the same as laughing AT the tragedy. And then he gives his favorite joke premises for mocking the governments responsible for arresting pastors...

Finally,  we spend the vast majority of our time unpacking the most self-centered and dehumanizing comments from a Feminist about somebody's child that you've heard in awhile.  (And if you have screenshots of something MORE outrageous and offensive than this, please share them with us!)

Don't forget to send emails to nextdoor@johnbranyan.com, to be part of the show. Feel free to write letting The Peaches know how much her new sound effects complete the show.

Join us at the Fight Laugh Feast CONFERENCE (not rally) in September. We look forward to meeting you there!</p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Abusing Rhetoric (Miraculous Weight Gain) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/fb6966fd-ebca-49f0-800b-89a43383f436/tcnd-abusing-rhetoric-miraculous-weight-gain.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>John's car broke down, but at least he was able to drive 3/4 of a mile first!  Our friend, Nathan, made a great comment about people using rhetoric to say what they DON'T REALLY MEAN, and the Peaches decided to make it the theme of this episode. 
John's sister ("Aunt Bonnie") once found an injured bird in a parking lot, and it became a favorite family story about crazy emotions.  

Can you EVER trust your emotions?  We don't answer that... but you can't be mad when people laugh at your extremism.   This reminds the Peaches of a comment about gluttony and obesity that is so outrageous she has to read it verbatim. 

Later, John embraces the chaos and goes off script by trying to read a comment that is almost completely unintelligble.  Even having seen the comment with her own eyes, the Peaches needs a translator.  Apparently, one of John's former classmates passed away and another classmate was really broken up about it...so he took the opportunity to verbally abuse everyone else in the graduating class. 

Also, the next generation thinks you are going to look at their bracelets in order to figure out what pronouns to use. 

All of this is related to emotionalism and rhetoric, and it will keep happening if we continue prioritizing style and tone above objective truth. 

Follow the Comedian Next Door on Gab and MeWe.  He also posts on Facebook sometimes. 
Watch the Starving Comics Quarantine Show every Sunday at 7:00 Eastern, on the John Branyan YouTube Channel.
We'll see you at the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Tenessee this September!

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Why does Amanda ("Peaches") have a reputation for being The Salty One, when sis-in-law, Marla, says offensive things, too?  (John has an answer the Peaches doesn't like.)   Then we go to the Mail Bag...   Our neighbor doesn't know any Christians who are able to laugh at themselves!  NONE!  How can we move beyond the "safe" topics like slipping on banana peels and learn to laugh at ourselves?</p>



<p>
Sign up for John's comedy workshop at Fight Laugh Feast University!   It's called "Life is Hardy Har-Hard." 
Click here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://flfnetwork.com/product/life-is-hardy-har-hard-a-comedy-workshop-for-christians/" target="_blank">https://flfnetwork.com/product/life-is-hardy-har-hard-a-comedy-workshop-for-christians/</a></p>



<p>The Peaches writes these descriptions. Aren't they interesting?
Watch the Butter Video by clicking this link:  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGQSRjpU4F8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGQSRjpU4F8" target="_blank"> I Just Need Butter</a>   It's hysterical. Click it!</p>



<p> Later, we explore the role of the Straight Man.  Groaning and eye-rolling is a legitimate part of the Comedy Team, Neighbor! And then the Peaches is in a Whirl about the manipulation behind phrases like "I'm not going to debate" or "I'm not trying to change your mind."  DON'T FALL FOR IT, NEIGHBOR!  THEY ARE LYING POLITELY, and they definitely ARE trying to change your mind!  Don't be a naive girl at a college frat party!</p>



<p>Bottom line: we want to be friends with people who laugh.  Let's learn how to do that more often!
Make sure you<a href="https://flfnetwork.com/politics-of-sex/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://flfnetwork.com/politics-of-sex/"> register for the Fight Laugh Feast Conference</a>, taking place in Tennessee this September.

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Mock as You’d Have Others Mock You (SURPRISE!) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/d4a1e399-05dc-4e5f-849d-98effec08551/tcnd-mock-as-youd-have-others-mock-you-surprise.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>John just came back from a SURPRISE show... which isn't really as great as it may sound. This reminds Amanda ("Peaches") about the special event happening in the children's department at the local library, in honor of Pride Month. Which, actually, ALSO is less great than it was meant to sound. Then, we hit the mail bag, because one of our Neighbors wants to push back on the idea that it's okay to mock people's bad ideas. How do we avoid being one of the "scoffers" from Psalm 1? This also leads nicely into the Peaches' rant today: women often say they want a partner who makes them laugh and is their best friend. They want a Dax Shephard to share funny stories; but they're not Kristin Bell!  (That makes more sense when you've heard the Sloth Story.)   Finally: what should you do when a kind stranger washes your windshield?  And how big is pickle-sized hail? All this and more on today's episode!

 You can join John's Comedy Clique and get special member content.  Visit johnbranyan.com for more info. 
Also, ask about a promo code to attend VACAY WITH COMICS.  Email nextdoor@johnbranyan.com with all questions, comments, and good-natured mockery.

See you next time, Neighbor!

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kitchen table of the Comedian Next Door--a cozy household where there's laundry being washed in the background, and we didn't realize our mics were picking it up for the first ten minutes!   (As always, we're very high tech around here.) We're going on a picnic, and you can't come unless you figure out the rule and bring along the right item! This is a game we play with 10-year-old Cami and 7-year-old Collin.   And here's a new segment:  MAIL BAG! Send us your suggestions for appropriate sound effects.  Because, again, we're very high tech around here.  Our listener, Pkarlgha, wants to know whether pastors should be using their pulpits to push vaccines as the "Christian thing to do."   Are we alienating people from the Gospel if we are hesistant to get a vaccine?  Also:  IU Health is trying to make COVID vaccines mandatory for ALL employees, students, and vendors.  
</p>



<p>We mention Patrick Mahoney's ministry completely by mistake in this episode. (Turns out he isn't the quarterback for the Greenbay Packers.) But maybe God brought him to mind for a reason!  Here's a link if you'd like to support Colegio Biblico:  colegiobiblico.net    They provide Christian education to pastors and missionaries serving Spanish-speaking countries.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We get to play the Cliche Game with 5-year-old Emmi and laugh heartily at her responses.  (If you have a Kindergartener in your life, Neighbor, then ask him/her to fill in the blank with popular sayings, and send us the results.)  Next--we need to accept criticism when it's true, even when it comes from really awful people...  And, speaking of awful people, we bring up the unwashed miscreants on Gab.  Some gross stuff comes out of people's hearts when you let them talk freely. But don't give into the temptation to be a victim, Neighbor!   We will damage our children if we pity them for the injustice they'll inevitably encounter. Bonus stories: John was treated unfairly as a kid!...but his mom taught him that's how life goes sometimes.  
Finally, John proposes we should LET PEOPLE APOLOGIZE to the Woke mob for things they "did wrong," when their consciences demand it.  If someone wants to confess the they're horrible sinners for voicing an Indian on the Simpson's, then so be it. 

Does anybody read the subscribe information at the bottom of the page?

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're recording on a Sunday, and the Comedian's house is FULL of family. (Listen to the chatter in the background...)  Amanda, aka The Peaches, has been wrangling approximately 4,127 children this week. So she's a little impatient with John's slow reading of emails.   A listener wants to know where to find The Peaches' blog posts, and--whoops--we never actually answer that question. (Here, Neighbor! <a href="https://culturesatwar.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/if-family-doesnt-end-then-marriages-shouldnt-either/"> culturesatwar.wordpress.com</a>)  It turns out, we made a strong case for "the Indissolubility of marriage" without knowing that term.  Also, a different listener calls us out on a blindspot involving female church leaders, and now we're collecting the basal temperatures of our listeners...for science!  In the Good Grief segment, we talk about how to manage when an Atheist is angry at you.  This leads nicely into the Peaches in a Whirl segment. She shares how David Wood manages when Muslims are angry at him.   Don't tell other Christians they're doing ministry wrong, if you're not doing it better!  Finally, is it EVER okay to add an adjective before the word "Christian?" John is ready to die on this hill, and you're invited to join him.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Mark and Deanna Gungor are in the house today...on our computer screen.   Doorbells are ringing, kids are laughing in the background, and we're talking about how Mark upset some people on social media. Topics include:  Separating from abusive spouses, the problems with marriage counseling, asking questions, and "Women be crazy." (But don't say that last part on Facebook!)

"I promise you guys, this Sunday there will be churches all across America where Johnny and Suzie are getting a divorce, and everyone will be shocked." --Mark Gungor

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We start the episode playing a game with 10-year-old Cami and 7-year-old Collin you can try with your family in the car or waiting areas...  
Then John/Dad/Grandpa reads a study that concludes women are "healthier" in churches with female leaders. He has some advice for people who want to laugh about that.  Later, the Peaches brings up "Husbands are the heads, but wives are the necks."  She shares the name of a preacher who agrees with the Bible that Jesus is the Gate...but he says Christians are the hinges who can prevent people from entering if we're not open enough.  (LOL!)
Finally, we're not done talking about whether Sunday is the first day of the week! And the army gathering to die on that hill is getting larger.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>From time to time, we have house guests come to visit!  When that happens, we throw all structure and professionalism out the window and simply go with the flow. In today's special episode, we share the table with author and editor at Staseos, CARMEN SCHOBER. Topics include Christian fiction, getting cancelled, gender roles, and whether it's appropriate for women to beat the crap out of each other.   "Some people may be hesitant to read my book because they think I'm casting women in this G.I. Jane type of role. But one of my favorite things about the romance genre is that it highlights the differences between the sexes. And, in 2021, you need that!"
Carmen's book, After She Falls, is available for preorder on Amazon, and you can find her at carmenschober.com.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John and the Peaches have a lot to disagree about--including music theory and what it tastes like when you combine wheat thins with green grapes.  Then, John reads an email from a listener/neighbor asking for his take on Christian Hedonism. (Is it a sin to enjoy things?)  Meanwhile, the Peaches nearly ruptures her ear drums trying to fix her headphones. Next, a female neighbor wants to challenge the recommendation that everyone should "say true things," because it could lead to nagging and bitterness...  Finally, John's Hill to Die On includes the charge to destigmatize stigma.  What does that even mean, and will you join him?

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Peaches doesn't want to talk about Brood X. Some listeners actually took us up on the offer to write their "honest wedding vows," so we share the resulting masterpieces! Then--the Good Grief segment features a story about stillbirth/child-loss.  Is the world ready for parents who include laughter as part of the mourning process? Next--the Peaches pleads with humanity to get in the habit of saying true things (for crying out loud).  And finally, John invites you to die with him on yet another hill.  Are we too quick to label our opinions as "biblical truth?"

   <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the first OFFICIAL episode of The Comedian Next Door--if you don't count the Super Secret Alpha Test Episode. (Which we don't.)  We're immediately interrupted by a phone call from a fellow comedian friend. Then we discuss various reasons a person may intentionally look ridiculous in public, including a family story about Tim (John's son--Peaches' brother) wearing something that didn't belong to him, just for laughs.  Finally, John proposes a hill to die on and invites you to join...if only we can sort out the official documents.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>When you're a member of a comedian's family, everyone wants to know: "Is he funny at home?!"   Four years ago, we decided to turn on a recorder so you could judge for yourself. Now that we're moving our podcast to a new "neighborhood" on the Fight Laugh Feast Network, we do our best to introduce ourselves with clarity and enthusiasm.  (Spoilers: we fail miserably.)  Ice-breakers are awkward, and we'd rather skip the First Impressions so we can jump straight to being Old Friends.  But just bear with us, New Neighbor.  If you give us time, we think you'll really like having a Comedian Next Door.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Good Grief! We help a listener find humor in chronic pain that resulted from military service.  The Peaches shares about the first time one of her blog posts caused social media outrage. Related: weddings would be much more interesting if the vows were written for honesty rather than poetry.  Finally, John criticizes Tim Keller, but The Peaches isn't convinced he picked a good "hill" this time. Let us know if you agree!

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Peaches is having one of "those" homeschool days. Emmi (5-years-old) requires some discipline right off the bat.  A listener asks John whether he can trust his sense of humor considering humans are sinful creatures.  And we unpack the reasons we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously. This results in possibly the best analogy about our relationship with God that we've ever stumbled upon!
