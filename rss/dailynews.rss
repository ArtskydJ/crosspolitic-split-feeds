<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump REINSTATED on Facebook, Instagram</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Meta reinstated former President Donald Trump on their Facebook and Instagram social media platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta announced in January that it intended to reinstate Trump's accounts, a full two years after they claimed he was suspended for violating their terms of service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v274pzq-meta-president-for-global-affairs-nick-clegg-on-trumps-reinstatement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v274pzq-meta-president-for-global-affairs-nick-clegg-on-trumps-reinstatement.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg wrote in a statement, "Two years ago, we took action in what were extreme and highly unusual circumstances. We indefinitely suspended then-US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Facebook and Instagram accounts following his praise for people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Facebook, Trump's last post was from January 6 and reads, "I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law &amp; Order &ndash; respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being removed from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter Trump created his own social media network, Truth Social, and has not yet become active on the sites that have reinstated him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepoliticalinsider.com/non-binary-god-the-church-of-england-considers-making-language-in-scripture-gender-neutral/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepoliticalinsider.com/non-binary-god-the-church-of-england-considers-making-language-in-scripture-gender-neutral/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the name of the Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit&hellip;Amen; At least it is for now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Church of England is studying and deliberating on possibly changing the language of scripture to be gender-neutral.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welby's Church of England will begin using pronouns that are "gender neutral" in reference to God.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When referring to God in some prayers, the male pronouns 'He' and 'Him' will be eliminated, and the phrase "our Father" will be omitted from the beginning of the Lord's Prayer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument that God shouldn&rsquo;t be referred to in masculine terms is not new. One only has to remember the 1999 movie &lsquo;Dogma&rsquo; starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as fallen angels that depicted God as a woman played by not-ironic at-all Alanis Morrissette.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An argument by many on the left side of this argument claim that referring to God as exclusively male is what drives a lot of discrimination and sexism against women. Add to that the recent surge in gender ideology that you can identify as any number of over 50 genders; the scripture gets even more complicated for the left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this societal fad, Rev. Joanna Stobart from the Diocese of Bath and Wells has asked the Church of England to &ldquo;develop more inclusive language in our authorized liturgy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reverend is asking the Church to &ldquo;provide more options for those who wish to use authorized liturgy and speak of God in a non-gendered way, particularly, in authorized absolutions where many of the prayers offered for use refer to God using male pronouns.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not everyone sees this issue the same way, thank God.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/09/missouri-rejects-ban-children-carrying-guns-in-public"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/09/missouri-rejects-ban-children-carrying-guns-in-public</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri votes against banning children from carrying guns in public</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican-led Missouri state house on Wednesday voted against banning minors from openly carrying firearms on public land without adult supervision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal to ban children from carrying guns without adult supervision in public failed by a 104-39 vote. Only one Republican voted in support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Democrat, Donna Baringer, said police in her district asked for the change to stop &ldquo;14-year-olds walking down the middle of the street in the city of St Louis carrying AR-15s&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Missouri lawmakers repealed concealed carry requirements in most situations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure was part of an hours-long debate on the best way to fight crime, particularly in the St Louis area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Lane Roberts &ndash; a former Joplin, Missouri, police chief and state public safety director &ndash; initially included the restrictions on children possessing guns in a broader crime bill, which the House voted to give initial approval. But lawmakers on a House committee that Roberts leads stripped the provision on guns last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other provisions in the measure would allow the governor to appoint a special prosecutor in counties with high crime rates, a provision targeted at the St Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans for years have criticized Gardner, a 47-year-old Democrat first elected in 2016 as St Louis&rsquo;s first Black female prosecutor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is one of several progressive prosecutors elected in recent years with a focus on creating more fairness in the criminal justice system. Republicans say she is not doing enough to fight crime.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Gaetz Introduces Resolution to END Financial Aid to Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution also calls for a peace agreement after almost a year-long war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaetz and ten co-sponsors introduced the &ldquo;Ukraine Fatigue Resolution,&rdquo; which calls for the U.S. to &ldquo;end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Fox News reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution notes that since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort, with more than $110 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally. It includes more than $27.4 billion in security assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Daily Fetched reported last month, the total amount of military aid provided to Kyiv from the United States has soared past $26 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, Antony Blinken announced a further $2.5 billion in military aid for Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the $2.5 billion for Ukraine, congress already awarded $45 billion to the country in the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill, which was signed into law in December 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,&rdquo; Biden said, making that announcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News also notes that the resolution lists the enormous amount of equipment that the U.S. has provided to the country since the beginning of the conflict. It also cites Pentagon officials who have said the munitions have &ldquo;severely depleted United States stockpiles, weakening United States readiness in the event of conflict.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also claims that by providing assistance, the U.S. is inadvertently contributing to civilian casualties, and notes the U.S. estimates that 40,000 civilians had died in the conflict.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concern about the continued U.S. funding of the war has grown among a subset of Republicans as the conflict has dragged on, with lawmakers highlighting issues at home that could use additional funding &ndash; including what they see as a failure to protect the U.S. border against a historic migrant crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Gaetz said the U.S. has been the top contributor to an &ldquo;everlasting conflict.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-wants-downed-spy-aircraft-back-does-not-belong-to-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-wants-downed-spy-aircraft-back-does-not-belong-to-us</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China wants its downed spy aircraft back, saying it 'does not belong to the US'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People's Republic of China is requesting the return of its surveillance aircraft after the balloon was shot down over the continental United States on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning fielded questions Tuesday about the incident, which dominated news cycles and commanded attention from U.S. politicians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked for additional information regarding the purpose of the spy balloon and reports of similar aircraft making routes through North American and South American airspace, Mao declined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Chinese side has given information about the unmanned airship on several occasions. I don&rsquo;t have anything to add at the moment," she stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon said it "acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information" from the spy platform. But geopolitical experts said there is little reason to believe those efforts were successful as the balloon almost certainly transferred surveillance data over to China as it flew over several military bases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if China has requested that the debris from the destroyed aircraft be returned, Mao said Tuesday, "The airship does not belong to the U.S. It belongs to China."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mao reiterated in her Tuesday press conference the Chinese Communist Party's claim that the balloon was civilian in nature and criticized the U.S. government for not acting in a "calm and professional manner."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://contra.substack.com/p/us-led-west-opposed-peace-deal-in?r=lj90&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_campaign=post"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://contra.substack.com/p/us-led-west-opposed-peace-deal-in?r=lj90&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_campaign=post</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S.-Led West Opposed Peace Deal in Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naftali Bennett, then the prime minister of Israel, found himself praying aboard a cramped, decrepit plane last year as it sailed over Kazakhstan. The long flight, arranged with help from the Mossad, was bound for Moscow on a desperate mission: broker peace between Russia and Ukraine just after the two countries had gone to war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bennett, Russian President Vladimir Putin made two major concessions during their March 5 meeting. First, he renounced &ldquo;denazification&rdquo;&mdash;that is, regime change in Kiev. Second, he dropped his demand for Ukraine&rsquo;s demilitarization. Bennett said President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to abandon Ukraine&rsquo;s pursuit of NATO membership in exchange. Both Putin and Zelensky seemed eager to end the fighting. But the U.S. had other plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett said a &ldquo;decision by the West&rdquo; was made &ldquo;to keep striking Putin&rdquo; through Ukraine. &ldquo;They blocked it and I thought they were wrong,&rdquo; he said. Bennett noted that the governments of Germany and France were pragmatic toward the idea compared to the U.S. and the U.K., which took a more belligerent attitude against Russia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the U.K. is little more than a neutered lapdog of D.C., it is more than likely that it was the U.S. who decided to keep the war going. Indeed, Bennett said he deferred &ldquo;to America in this regard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with author and comedian Hanoch Daum, Bennett provided a behind-the-scenes look at his efforts to establish a ceasefire and how it initially showed promise until being doomed by imperial intrigue. It was the first time time he talked about his attempt to mediate peace between the two countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His solution was &ldquo;creating contact with both sides and trying to mediate,&rdquo; leveraging his good relations with Putin and Zelensky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett maintained contact with the governments of Germany, France, the U.K., and the U.S. throughout the negotiations, keeping them appraised as talks, mostly by phone, progressed. While Putin was open to diplomacy, the U.S. was not, according to Bennett.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett described Putin as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Messianic&rdquo; but governed by limited, concrete objectives, contra the Western portrait of him as a madman bent on world domination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putin does not think of himself as an imperialist, Bennett said, but as someone fighting against imperialism in the form of NATO expansionism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone, maybe Mark Twain, said that history doesn&rsquo;t repeat, but it does rhyme. What Bennett revealed is a reminder that the U.S. has been calling the war tune for decades.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Sues Biden Admin Over &lsquo;Pharmacy Mandate&rsquo; to Dispense Abortion Drugs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration on Tuesday to block federal health guidance that allegedly forces pharmacies to dispense abortion-inducing drugs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration in July 2022 released guidance requiring pharmacies to supply women with abortion-inducing drugs or risk losing Medicaid and Medicare funds, even if certain state laws prohibit the procedure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas argues in its lawsuit, which refers to the guidance collectively as the &ldquo;pharmacy mandate,&rdquo; that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has attempted to impose, via executive fiat, a federal right to abortion. The lawsuit said this was a part of the Biden administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;war against&rdquo; the Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health decision. That ruling reversed a 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;But whether the Biden Administration likes it or not, the question of abortion is up to the people&rsquo;s elected representatives&mdash;not unelected bureaucrats,&rdquo; the lawsuit states (pdf). &ldquo;The Biden Administration&rsquo;s attempt to inject itself into that question is both procedurally and substantively illegal.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HHS guidance, which involved roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies, claims that federal anti-discrimination law requires pharmacies to provide these drugs. The guidance was released on July 13, 2022, a few days after President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed an executive order that made it easier to obtain abortion services following the Dobbs decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, argues that Title IX&rsquo;s anti-discrimination protections don&rsquo;t require companies to provide abortions, and instead protect any person or entity from being forced to aid in the provision of abortions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Paxton&rsquo;s office, the alleged HHS assertion that federal anti-discrimination law mandates every pharmacy to provide abortion drugs is &ldquo;patently false.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxton further argues that the Supreme Court returned the power to decide on abortion law back to the states, instead of the federal government. The &ldquo;pharmacy mandate,&rdquo; therefore, preempts certain state laws, which prohibit pharmacies from providing abortion-inducing drugs, and goes against the Dobbs decision, according to Paxton.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original copy of the HHS guidance document published in July 2022 is not currently available on the department&rsquo;s website, but a version archived on Jan. 23, 2023 can still be accessed (pdf).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance reminds approximately 60,000 retail pharmacies and their employees of their obligation &ldquo;under federal civil rights laws&rdquo; to ensure access to prescription medication.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could Chicago be about to elect a pro-life, pro-cop Democratic mayor?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago&rsquo;s next mayoral election is quickly approaching, scheduled for the 28th of this month. Most of the polls indicate that the incumbent mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is not doing well and she might not be given another term. That wouldn&rsquo;t be a terribly surprising result, given the soaring crime rates and the generally decrepit state of the Windy City these days. If that&rsquo;s the case, who will replace her? Interestingly enough, one of the current frontrunners is a man named Paul Vallas. What makes him unique among Chicago Democrats is his history of being opposed to abortion and his promises to crack down on crime. But can someone like that really be elected in a liberal stronghold? (ABC7 Chicago)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago mayoral candidates are touting dueling endorsements as Paul Vallas comes under fire for his Democratic credentials and past statements opposing abortion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several recent polls suggest Vallas is one of the frontrunners in the mayor&rsquo;s race, so it&rsquo;s no surprise he&rsquo;s coming under attack, but it&rsquo;s also an indication that this race will be rough and tumble in its final three weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the other candidates, Jesus &ldquo;Chuy&rdquo; Garcia, has been running attack ads against Vallas. He dug up a clip from some years ago where Vallas describes himself as &ldquo;more of a Republican than a Democrat&rdquo; and saying that he&rsquo;s personally opposed to abortion. Garcia is accusing him of not being a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Democrat and claims that Vallas would be &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; for Chicago. Really? More dangerous than, say&hellip; stopping your car at a red light for more than ten seconds?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vallas has now received the endorsement of both the Chicago Tribune and the Fraternal Order of Police, which is rather remarkable. The Chicago Sun-Times has run a number of articles on this Vallas, listing all of the progressive liberals who are losing their minds about him. They&rsquo;re accusing him of having trodden upon the rights of workers in previous positions he&rsquo;s held and wanting to outlaw abortions. There are probably a couple of them calling him a satan worshipper by now. In other words, all of the right people hate him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An update on the situation in Turkey &amp; Syria:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/earthquake-death-toll-crosses-5000-as-turkey-experiences-285-aftershocks_5039212.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport&amp;src_src=partner&amp;src_cmp=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/earthquake-death-toll-crosses-5000-as-turkey-experiences-285-aftershocks_5039212.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport&amp;src_src=partner&amp;src_cmp=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earthquake Death Toll Passes 7,200 as Turkey Experiences 285 Aftershocks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll from the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have exceeded 7,200, with thousands more injured, infrastructure crumbling, and rescue groups struggling to bring aid to the victims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Turkey, at least 5,434 people are confirmed dead. In Syria, state news agency SANA reported at least 1,832 deaths. Combined, at least 7,266 people have died in Turkey and Syria.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, at least 3,749 people are estimated to have been injured in Syria. Turkey&rsquo;s injured are estimated to be over 30,000. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the death toll could rise to around 20,000 in the coming days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quake, with an epicenter in the Pazarcik district of Turkey&rsquo;s southern Province, had a magnitude of 7.8. A second quake of 7.6 magnitude hit the same region nine hours later, worsening the situation. Turkey experienced 285 aftershocks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. President Joe Biden &ldquo;noted that U.S. teams are deploying quickly to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and coordinate other assistance that may be required by people affected by the earthquakes, including health services or basic relief items,&rdquo; a readout of Biden&rsquo;s conversation with Turkish President on Jan. 6 said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earthquakes have caused widespread devastation in Turkey. A video shared on Twitter shows innumerable buildings turned to rubble, with only a few tall buildings still standing. Another video shows a building crashing down while people run for safety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Turkey&rsquo;s southern region, which is home to some of the worst-hit cities, damaged roads and poor internet connections are hampering rescue attempts. In some places, freezing winter weather is also posing a challenge. Families were forced to sleep in cars lined up in the streets. Families wrapped themselves in blankets and gathered around fires to keep themselves warm. The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency of Turkey (AFAD) is said to have deployed 13,740 search and rescue personnel as well as over 300,000 blankets, 100,000 beds, and 41,000 tents to the region. According to Organ Tatar, an official from AFAD, 5,775 buildings have been destroyed by the quake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The infrastructure is damaged, the roads that we used to use for humanitarian work are damaged, we have to be creative in how to get to the people &hellip;&nbsp; but we are working hard,&rdquo; U.N. resident coordinator&nbsp; -told Reuters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earthquake on Monday is Turkey&rsquo;s deadliest since a quake of similar magnitude hit the country in 1999 and killed over 17,000 people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massive Human Trafficking Bust Sees 368 Arrested, 131 Rescued in California</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three hundred sixty-eight people have been arrested, and 131 victims rescued in large-scale human trafficking operation by a multi-agency task force in California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Michel Moore said: &ldquo;We know that the sex trade is a prolific one that exists throughout this state and throughout our nation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ugly scar against this great country that exists too oftentimes in plain sight,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Reclaim and Rebuild occurred between Jan. 22 and Jan. 28 in nine counties, including Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino, Kiro7 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies teamed up for the effort, including the LAPD, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victims of human trafficking, including ages ranging from 13 to 52, including children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators worked with victim advocacy groups to provide resources &ldquo;to help [victims] escape from this life-threatening environment,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators responded to advertisements offering sexual services and visited massage parlors suspected of being involved in sex trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those arrested included pimps and panderers, Moore said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victims, most of whom were kidnapped, face &ldquo;threat of death&rdquo; or coercion and are isolated from their former support to become dependent on the trafficker, Moore added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/death-tourism-oregon-becomes-national-destination-for-assisted-suicide?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/death-tourism-oregon-becomes-national-destination-for-assisted-suicide?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Death tourism': Oregon becomes national destination for assisted suicide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals residing in states that outlaw euthanasia, such as Texas, have started traveling to Oregon to gain assistance in their suicide, making the state the first "death tourism" destination in the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, Dr. Nicholas Gideonse, the director of End of Life Choices Oregon, recently admitted to assisting a man from Texas with Lou Gehrig's disease who came to the doctor's Portland clinic in achieving suicide and said that "for a small number of patients who otherwise qualify or are determined to go through that and who have the energy and the resources &hellip; it has started to happen."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Oregon's official website, the state passed its Death with Dignity Act in 1997, "which allows terminally ill individuals to end their lives through the voluntary self-administration of lethal medications, expressly prescribed by a physician for that purpose." The law enabled terminally ill patients expected to die within six months to request fatal drugs from doctors that the patient then takes and self-administers. In 2021, 238 people committed suicide via the program, and 383 doses of fatal drugs were prescribed by doctors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was originally a restriction for people out-of-state but in 2021 Dr. Gideonse sued Oregon to lift the restriction, which was granted in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, if a resident from another state wants to go to Oregon for the fatal drugs, they are placed on a 15-day waiting period. In that time paperwork is processed and two doctors along with witnesses must sign off on the request for suicide by prescription. The expansion of Death with Dignity to out-of-staters is not yet law in Oregon but is expected to be codified this year with House Bill 2279.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law resembles Canada's state-sponsored euthanasia program known as medical assistance in dying (MAiD), originally intended for those with physical illnesses where death was a reasonable inevitability although it has been amended to allow those with mental health issues to apply.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gideonse's original lawsuit was over neighboring residents of Washington who wanted suicide drugs and has expanded to residents from further states, including those with strict laws against euthanasia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive director of the Patients Rights Action Fund, a group pushing back against Oregon's law, Matt Valli&egrave;re, said "You end up in this Wild West scenario where people take the drugs back to their home states, and there are a lot more questions than there are answers about what would happen after that."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gideonse, who also has campaigned for legalizing psilocybin to treat depression, has connections with the Compassion &amp; Choices group which "grew out of the 1980s right-to-die movement of the Hemlock Society and Jack Kevorkian &mdash; the pathologist and notorious 'Dr Death' who assisted scores of suicides and was ultimately convicted of murder," reports the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tucker Carlson &amp; Charles Camosy spoke on this very subject.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Study Could Be 'Scientific Nail in the Coffin' for Masks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the largest and most comprehensive studies on the effectiveness of masks found they do almost nothing to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study reviewed 78 randomized control trials&mdash;experiments that have long been considered "the gold standard" for medicine&mdash;which assessed the effectiveness of face masks against flu, COVID-19, and similar illnesses. It found that wearing masks "probably makes little or no difference" for the general public, no matter what kind of mask is used. Even N95 masks, considered the most effective at filtering airborne particles, showed no clear benefit for health care workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study was published on January 30 by the Cochrane Library, a world-renowned medical database that is famous for its high-quality evidence reviews. It comes as a battering ram to the recommendations of the U.S. public health establishment, which urged children as young as two to wear masks throughout the pandemic.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 2,300 dead after devastating earthquake, aftershocks in Turkey and Syria</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll has surpassed 2,300 after a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Turkey and Syria around 4:17 am on Monday. Both countries have declared a state of emergency as rescue efforts move to find survivors trapped under rubble, reports the Times of Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck a few minutes later at 4:24 am approximately 60 miles north of the first quake's epicenter, which was centered in the southeastern province of Gaziantep, Turkey, according to the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quake's depth was up to 10 miles according to the US Geological Survey and had aftershocks reaching 6.7 on the Richter Scale. Tremors reverberated as far away as Israel and Cairo in Egypt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS reports that UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said "We stand ready to provide further support as needed." A total of 76 search and rescue specialists have been dispatched from the UK to help with the efforts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost immediately after the quake hit, Turkey asked the European Civil Project and Humanitarian Aid Operations for assistance and aid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Turkish Interior Minister said, "The main impact of the earthquake fell on Kahramanmaras. After that, there were at least 22 aftershocks, 6 of magnitude over 6. The earthquake was felt in 10 provinces</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Two hours after the earthquake, several dozen dead are known. In many cities, multi-storey buildings have been destroyed; it is not yet possible to start clearing the rubble."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prostitutes solicit sex right outside Catholic elementary school, police handcuffed after California Democrats passed law to protect transgender sex workers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents of children are up in arms that prostitutes are soliciting sex work right outside a California elementary school. Some are saying that a law passed by California Democrats has handcuffed law enforcement in cracking down on sex workers selling their bodies in broad daylight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGO-TV conducted an investigation about prostitutes working outside St. Anthony's elementary school in East Oakland. The San Francisco-based news station captured video of sex workers dressed in minimal clothes and stiletto heels walking the streets near the Catholic school to sell their bodies in the middle of the day with students nearby.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGO-TV reported, "The I-Team captured videos along E. 15th Street outside the school gate on four different dates over the past couple weeks showing young women wearing barely any clothing walking along the school sidewalk, the street corners, or directly across from the school. All of the videos were captured as children were being dropped off or walked into school."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerned parent Rosa Vargas told KGO-TV said she sees prostitutes near the Catholic school "every day, during all periods of the day."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vargas said the sex workers solicit sex so close to the elementary school that they recently "were blocking the entrance of the parking structure" of the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo noted that he is receiving complaints about prostitutes every week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallo stated, "I get the call saying, 'Mr. Gallo I can't get into my home because the pimp is blocking my driveway.' It's constant."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallo said he has seen up to 20 scantily-clad women walking up and down the street, appearing to engage in prostitution. He revealed that some of the girls are as young as 15 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials believe some of the women are victims of human trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some believe that recent construction along a busy highway caused the sex workers to migrate to residential neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodney Pierre-Antoine &ndash; who oversees seven Catholic elementary schools, including St. Anthony's &ndash; said the hands of the police "are somewhat handcuffed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierre-Antoine is referencing Senate Bill 357, known as the Safer Streets for All Act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 357 states:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing law prohibits soliciting or engaging in an act of prostitution, as specified. Existing law also prohibits loitering in a public place with the intent to commit prostitution, as defined, or directing, supervising, recruiting, or aiding a person who is loitering with the intent to commit prostitution, or collecting or receiving all or part of the proceeds of an act of prostitution. Under existing law, a violation of any of these provisions is a misdemeanor. This bill would repeal those provisions related to loitering with the intent to commit prostitution and would make other conforming changes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed SB 357 into law in July, and it went into effect on Jan. 1.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers told KGO-TV that the new law is prohibiting them from rescuing women who they believe are victims of human trafficking.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat-led state that&rsquo;s &lsquo;killing businesses&rsquo; could shrink amid push to secede in several counties</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 11 Oregon counties approved a preliminary vote to secede from the Democrat-led state, local leaders around the movement are explaining how the urban-rural divide has left them with no other choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People in eastern Oregon have felt like their state-level governance has not heard them, has not paid attention to our concerns, and has not been working for eastern Oregon," Greater Idaho Movement spokesperson Matt McCaw said on "Fox &amp; Friends First" Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCaw, along with Oregon business owner Sandie Gilson, supports the idea of having select counties elect to move their state borderlines so state-level governance would come from Idaho.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last two years, the Greater Idaho Movement has worked to gather constituent sentiment around the proposal. Business owners like Gilson sounded off on Oregon&rsquo;s tax policy, detailing the burden taken on by a corporate activity tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to secede from the state, McCaw argued, would be a "win-win" for all involved parties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formal state bill, called the Greater Idaho Bill, was introduced to the Oregon legislature on Jan. 10.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho state leaders reportedly motioned for formal discussions about the proposal last week, noting the purpose is to "begin official discussions on whether it is feasible to move the Idaho border into eastern Oregon."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if Idaho and Oregon were to negotiate a border adjustment, U.S. Congress would have to sign off on it, in addition to both Oregon and Idaho legislatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan would create what would become the nation&rsquo;s third-largest state geographically.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Months Of Late Night: 93 Liberal Guests, 1 Conservative</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The late-night comedy shows ended 2022 with a unanimously liberal guest count and that trend continued until the very last day of January, a NewsBusters study has revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRC analysts found that from Labor Day through January 31, liberal guests outnumbered conservative guests 93 to 1. It was 99 percent liberal and/or Democrat. The one exception was My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell who Jimmy Kimmel put on to mock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is follow up to MRC&rsquo;s late night guest election campaign study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study looked at the daily six late night comedy shows: ABC&rsquo;s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, NBC&rsquo;s Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, CBS&rsquo;s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden, and Comedy Central&rsquo;s The Daily Show with Trevor Noah and 2023 temp hosts. Fox's Gutfeld! was not included.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRC analysts divided guests into two categories: partisan officials and then journalists and celebrities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to the count of politicians, the count was 27 Democrats to 0 Republicans. Stephen Colbert led with ten, Noah was second with seven, Meyers was third at four, Fallon came in fourth with three, Kimmel placed fifth at two, and Corden was sixth and last with one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, and former First Lady Michelle Obama were the guests who appeared multiple times during the length of the study. Obama's appearance on Colbert was split into multiple episodes and is counted as multiple appearances and was the only guest to appear three times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for journalists and celebrities, the results were 66 liberals to 1 conservative. Stephen Colbert was again the most partisan with 21. Trevor Noah and The Daily Show temp hosts came in second at 17 (11 for Noah, 1 for Leslie Jones, 2 for Wanda Sykes, 3 for D.L. Hughley). Meyers and Fallon tied for bronze with ten. Kimmel again placed fifth with seven and Corden was the least partisan with one.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese spy balloon carried explosives to self-detonate</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon over the weekend, Pentagon officials have revealed that the balloon potentially was carrying explosives to destroy itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, Air Force Gen. Glen D. VanHerck, commander of US Northern Command, revealed in a Monday call with reporters that the Balloon, in addition to potentially carrying explosives, was 200 feet tall, weighed thousands of pounds, and its payload was the size of a jetliner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v28clmv-the-chinese-spy-balloon-has-finally-been-shot-down..html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v28clmv-the-chinese-spy-balloon-has-finally-been-shot-down..html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanHerck&rsquo;s comments came following a briefing by National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, who defended Biden&rsquo;s decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until the weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the coast of South Carolina on Saturday afternoon, the US military, using an F-22 fighter jet, shot down the balloon with a missile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly before the balloon was shot down, Federal Aviation Administration had issued a ground stop for three airports in the Carolinas located in Wilmington, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balloon had entered US airspace on January 28 and was known to the Biden administration for nearly a week before its report in the news on Thursday, February 2. The White House reportedly tried to keep its presence secret to not disrupt Secretary of State Antony Blinken scheduled trip to China, which was postponed after the public's discovery of the balloon.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antifa claims responsibility for attack on far-left Portland bar in retaliation for them 'spreading Covid' by staying open</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Rose City Antifa have taken credit for vandalism that occurred at a worker-owned Portland Bar in the early hours of January 29.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a "communique" posted to Rose City Counter-Info on January 31, the group stated that the vandalism, carried out by "disabled anarchists," targeted the Worker&rsquo;s Tap because of "how this bar inherently operates with unmitigated COVID spread."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In the early hours of January 29th, some disabled anarchist attacked Worker&rsquo;s Tap by tagging it and damaging a window. Due to the bullet-proof glass, the window&rsquo;s damage would only consist of small dents," the statement read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group said that phrases and symbols like the anarchist "A," and "161" which calls out "that it was fascists forces whom originally paved the path of COVID as a genocide since April 2020 through the blood of primarily Black and Indigenous disabled people, a road of bones which now many liberals and ableist anarchists goose-stomp on in collaboration with the fascists to maintain a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for keeping bars and other viral-friendly entertainment operating at the expense of disabled lives."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the bar was tagged with "Covid Kills!" twice "to address how this bar inherently operates with unmitigated COVID spread, murdering disabled people in the process."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement continued on to say that the act was carried out in "retaliation" to the "event organizers in the anarchist scene who contribute to the COVID pandemic by organizing super-spreader gatherings that, in the end, lead to more disabled people dying."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Multnomah County, where Portland is located, the number of new Covid-19 cases has remained under 1,000 since July. The most recent data shows that in the last full week of January, there were just 275 cases. 31 of those cases required hospitalization. This is down from a spike seen over the summer, with 3,180 cases recorded, and dramatically lower than the omicron spike seen last winter, with 11,373 cases being recorded at its peak, according to county data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Worker&rsquo;s Tap, the bar targeted by the vandalism, is a worker-owned and operated beer bar in Portland, Oregon. The bar required proof of vaccination to enter the establishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to its website, "Our business is run democratically and profits are split amongst our members."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilhan Omar REMOVED from Foreign Affairs Committee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, who has a long history of anti-Semitic remarks, was removed from her position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a 218 to 2011 party-line vote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Correspondent Chad Pergram tweeted, "The House has voted to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) from the Foreign Affairs Committee. The vote was 218 to 211 with one member voting 'present.'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he intended to remove Omar due to her history of antisemitic comments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries acknowledged this history on Thursday and said, "Rep. Omar certainly has made mistakes. She has used antisemitic tropes."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omer was elected to Congress in 2018, and in her long history of using antisemitic tropes has compared the boycotting of the Jewish state of Israel to the boycotting of Nazis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A move to remove Omar began in 2021 after the Democrat-led Congress removed GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a press conference that the removal was a "political stunt" and a "disservice to the American people."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Omar out, but Biden's Top Economic Advisor Is Out</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden announced Thursday morning his top economic advisor, Brian Deese, is leaving his position at the White House. Deese served as Biden's National Economic Council Director since taking office in January 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deese's departure comes as economists warn the U.S. is headed into a recession this year. As the head of the NEC, Deese repeatedly claimed Biden's inflation crisis was transitory and advocated for massive federal government spending by Democrats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS' Margaret Brennan pressed Deese over Biden's lie that inflation was "transitory" and solely due to Putin's war:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain officially left his position on Wednesday.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/madelineleesman/2023/02/01/trans-inmate-sent-to-womens-prison-n2618969"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/madelineleesman/2023/02/01/trans-inmate-sent-to-womens-prison-n2618969</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender Inmate Who Committed Kidnapping, Murder Transferred to Women&rsquo;s Prison</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A biological male prisoner who began identifying as a transgender woman and has a history of violence against women was reportedly transferred from a men&rsquo;s prison in Kansas to a women&rsquo;s prison this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inmate, who was known as Thomas Lamb, was convicted of kidnapping and killing a young woman in 1969 and kidnapping a second woman in 1970, according to News13. In 2007, Thomas Lamb changed his name to &ldquo;Michelle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years that followed, Lamb reportedly requested to be moved to a women&rsquo;s facility. This request, however, was denied. But, records obtained by News13 show that Lamb was moved to a women&rsquo;s prison this month (via News 13):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, a U.S. District Court ruled against Lamb in a lawsuit asking the state to transfer HIM to an all-female facility, and allow him to pursue gender re-assignment surgery. An Appeals Court upheld the ruling in 2018, stating that, although it was not the treatment Lamb might want, evidence showed he was being provided treatment for gender dysphoria, and the state was not showing &ldquo;deliberate indifference&rdquo; to his situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Kansas Dept. of Corrections records show he was transferred Jan. 27 to Topeka Correctional Facility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is not known if Lamb will now be allowed to go forward with the gender reassignment surgery, 13 NEWS asked KDOC public affairs director Randall Bowman whether the state would pay for the procedure if he did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowman would not comment on Lamb&rsquo;s case specifically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Healthcare decisions are not made by KDOC officials,&rdquo; Bowman said. &ldquo;Due to patient privacy concerns, KDOC and the Governor&rsquo;s Office cannot comment on the specifics of medical care for any one individual.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/02/tom-brady-announces-his-retirement-for-good-from-the-nfl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/02/tom-brady-announces-his-retirement-for-good-from-the-nfl/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Brady Announces His Retirement &lsquo;For Good&rsquo; From The NFL</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brady, 45, is widely considered the best to ever play his position and potentially the greatest NFL star of all time, following a 23-year career that saw him go to 15 Pro Bowls and win five league MVP awards. His accolades are so far-reaching that his name fills the record books. He leaves the game as its all-time leader in completions (7,753), yards (89, 214), and touchdowns (649).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning six titles playing for Coach Bill Belichick in New England, Brady mulled retirement before signing with Tampa Bay in 2020. He would go on to win his seventh Super Bowl in his first year for the Buccaneers. There, he would be reunited with his old Patriot partner in crime, Rob Gronkowski.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately for Brady and the Bucs, the last two seasons have been a bit of a downward spiral. They captured the woeful NFC South. But at 8-9, they didn&rsquo;t look like they had a prayer of advancing in the postseason. They were bounced by the Dallas Cowboys in the opening round, 31-14, the team looked old and tired, even their forever-young signal caller.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brady certainly was no slouch during the regular season. He still threw for threw for 4694&nbsp; yards and 25 touchdowns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he already (half-heartedly) put off retirement last year to return for one more round. He famously announced he was quitting, had a flirtation with joining the Miami Dolphins organization, and then finally acquiesced to returning to Tampa for 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the fatigue and frustration were already there. And the whispers grew into full-fledged gossip as the season progressed: This looked more and more like it was Tom Brady&rsquo;s final season. At least in Tampa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he&rsquo;s confirmed that he won&rsquo;t be playing for anyone in 2023. Brady is, as he puts it into his own words, retiring &ldquo;for good&rdquo; this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his farewell video, the future NFL Hall of Famer was (as usual) reserved and reminiscent. Like so many of his famous fourth-quarter comebacks, he tried to stay calm and cool in the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Tom Brady couldn&rsquo;t hide a hint of emotion as he bid farewell to those who helped him on his epic journey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When his story is eventually written, Brady&rsquo;s will be about an unlikely hero who rose to the level of royalty. He ascended to heights never before reached, all while coming from nearly the bottom of the heap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was famously picked 199th overall in the 2000 draft by the Patriots, behind six other quarterbacks. During his rookie campaign, he played in only one game and didn&rsquo;t exactly look like a future great: The University of Michigan product finished the season having only gone one-for-three for six yards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2001, a serious injury to franchise quarterback Drew Bledsoe would necessitate the start of the Brady Era in New England.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What followed was the greatest run that any quarterback, head coach, or franchise would ever embark on in NFL history. After upsetting the dominant St. Louis Rams and &lsquo;The Greatest Show on Turf&rsquo; in Super Bowl XXXVI the next 17 years were like a whirlwind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What New England was able to accomplish in the 2000s and 2010s not only superseded anything ever seen in the NFL, it rivaled storied franchises from any sport and any era. The Murderers&rsquo; Row Yankees of 1920s Major League Baseball or the NHL&rsquo;s Montreal Canadiens from the 1950s-70s come to mind&hellip; but that&rsquo;s about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers alone put up by Brady and his teams over the years is astronomical. When Joe Montana retired as the gold standard of Super Bowl QBs, he had four rings. TB12 has almost twice that many. And he&rsquo;s played in a whopping TEN title games. The ability to stay healthy and play that well for so many years will likely never be seen by sports fans&rsquo; eyes again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say that Brady&rsquo;s departure from a league where he will always be a figurehead is hard to overstate. His mark on the NFL and the game of football is unparalleled. And his track record of winning is nearly unfathomable. His road to Canton is literally paved in gold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of his successors in signal calling, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said about the G.O.A.T., &ldquo;It&rsquo;s special to see the things he has done in this league. The way he was able to change the position &mdash; the longevity of great success. That&rsquo;s the crazy part: looking at his career, he has never really had a down year.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, it&rsquo;s Friday&hellip; How about a quick feel-good story heading into your weekend?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conservativereview.com/amazon-driver-risks-his-own-safety-to-rescue-dog-from-burning-car-2659365675.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.conservativereview.com/amazon-driver-risks-his-own-safety-to-rescue-dog-from-burning-car-2659365675.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon driver risks his own safety to rescue dog from burning car</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Amazon driver with a history of helping others while on his route came to the rescue once again when he recently helped spring a dog that had become trapped inside a burning vehicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the evening of January 23, Ervin Ruhe, a 49-year-old Amazon driver, was heading home after a long day at work. He had just assisted a colleague finish his deliveries when he spotted a car on fire on the side of the road in Merced, about 40 minutes outside his hometown of Modesto, California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruhe spotted a man guiding his wife away from the burning vehicle and stopped to see whether he could help. Ruhe described the man &mdash; who, by that time, had returned to the vehicle and had begun attempting to open one of the car doors &mdash; as "distressed," so Ruhe pulled over and quickly grabbed the emergency fire extinguisher located in the back of his delivery van.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It didn&rsquo;t look like it was too bad yet, but I was just hoping nobody was inside," Ruhe later recalled. "I just wanted to try and help out if I was able to."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruhe began immediately dousing the flames with the fire extinguisher when the couple apprised him of their main concern. "Our dog&rsquo;s inside," one of them shouted, "our dog&rsquo;s inside!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, a small chihuahua was trapped in the back seat of the vehicle. Ruhe managed to contain the fire enough to unlock the back door so that the man could open it and bring the little pooch to safety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all creatures, great and small, were out of danger, Ruhe called 911 and took a quick video of the burning car.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Ban China from Buying US Farmland</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and John Tester (D-Mont.) on Feb. 1 introduced a bill to ban China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea from buying or leasing U.S. farmland and agricultural businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed legislation, named the PASS (Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security) Act of 2023, would require the president to report to Congress on any waiver granted to the prohibited countries. It would also make the secretary of agriculture a standing member of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a federal panel that reviews foreign acquisitions for national security risks, and specify agricultural investments as falling under CFIUS&rsquo; jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the legislation is the same as a version introduced last year, Rounds said that this year&rsquo;s bill has more bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress and support from stakeholders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The intent behind this particular legislation was to prohibit China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from establishing locations in the United States where they could monitor activity, specifically potential military activity,&rdquo; said Rounds in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rounds highlighted the value of farming and seed technology developed in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;China has an interest in taking some of our advancements and using them in their country without acknowledging the patents that may accompany that material, which is made easier if they have a base of operation in the United States in which to obtain the material in the first place,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third-generation Montana farmer, Tester said in a statement that he was proud to sponsor the bill to &ldquo;ensure our farmers have a seat at the table when the government makes decisions impacting our national security.&rdquo; Tester added that he was not going to &ldquo;sit back&rdquo; and &ldquo;let our foreign adversaries weaken our national security by buying up American farmland.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture is the lifeblood of South Dakota&rsquo;s economy, worth nearly $12 billion in 2021, according to the South Dakota Department of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources (pdf). As the state&rsquo;s largest industry, agriculture leads tourism&mdash;the second-largest industry, estimated at over $4 billion in 2021&mdash;by three times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South Dakota Farmers Union (SDFU) and South Dakota Sheep Growers Association (SDSGA) have endorsed the bill. Doug Sombke, president of SDFU, in a statement also encouraged other state farmers&rsquo; unions to support the bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is cosponsored by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.). The House version, also introduced on Wednesday, is sponsored by Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Jim Costa (D-Calif.), and Rick Crawford (R-Ark.).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, CFIUS decided that it didn&rsquo;t have jurisdiction to review a land purchase related to a controversial Chinese corn mill project in Grand Forks, North Dakota. That project is located within 15 miles of the Grand Forks Air Force base, which houses sensitive drone, satellite, and surveillance technology, and has prompted significant pushback from Republican lawmakers and locals who say it threatens both national and economic security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Dec. 31, 2020, China owned 325,686 acres of U.S. agricultural land, according to the Department of Agriculture. While the acreage under Chinese ownership is slightly less than 1 percent of all foreign-held agricultural land, it represents a 20-fold leap from 13,720 acres in 2010.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the relatively low percentage of Chinese ownership does not diminish the severity of the threat, according to Rounds, who said that thwarting the trend is important.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lifenews.com/2023/02/01/satanic-temple-opens-new-abortion-clinic-to-kill-babies-in-ritualistic-abortions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.lifenews.com/2023/02/01/satanic-temple-opens-new-abortion-clinic-to-kill-babies-in-ritualistic-abortions/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satanic Temple Opens New Abortion Clinic to Kill Babies in Ritualistic Abortions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple isn&rsquo;t just promoting the killing of unborn babies in abortions anymore. It&rsquo;s actually killing them through a new &ldquo;religious&rdquo; abortion practice in New Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the satanic group launched a new &ldquo;religious medical services arm,&rdquo; TST Health, to begin doing abortions. The Satanic Temple believes aborting unborn babies is a religious &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; and compares it to communion or baptism for Christians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of its first &ldquo;telehealth&rdquo; abortion practice doubles as a covert death wish to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Samuel Alito&rsquo;s Mom&rsquo;s Satanic Abortion Clinic in New Mexico will offer abortion drugs to women ages 17 and up who are up to 11 weeks of pregnancy, according to Fox News. The FDA does not recommend abortion drugs after 10 weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In 1950, Samuel Alito&rsquo;s mother did not have options, and look what happened,&rdquo; said Malcolm Jarry, co-founder of The Satanic Temple, in a statement. &ldquo;Prior to 1973, doctors who performed abortions could lose their licenses and go to jail. The clinic&rsquo;s name serves to remind people just how important it is to have the right to control one&rsquo;s body and the potential ramifications of losing that right.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a press release from the group, &ldquo;anyone in New Mexico seeking to perform The Satanic Temple&rsquo;s abortion ritual will be able to receive free online medical services.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Licensed medical workers will screen patients during a virtual appointment, and then prescribe abortion drugs through pharmacies that will mail them in &ldquo;a discreet package,&rdquo; the group said. Women will be charged a pharmacy fee of about $90, it continued. The satanic group also set up a 24-hour abortion hotline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, The Satanic Temple leaders said they want to expand their new abortion practice to states that ban abortions. Their group has filed lawsuits in several states challenging their legal protections for unborn babies on religious grounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The satanic group claims killing unborn babies in abortions is a religious ritual, and restricting it violates its &ldquo;fundamental tenets,&rdquo; according to an article on Glenn Beck&rsquo;s website. Its leaders also claim pro-life laws are rooted in &ldquo;Christian nationalism&rdquo; &ndash; even though people of all faiths and no faith believe basic human rights should apply to all human beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supposed religion claims to have &ldquo;seven fundamental tenets,&rdquo; including one that teaches, &ldquo;One&rsquo;s body is inviolable, subject to one&rsquo;s own will alone.&rdquo; In its lawsuits, the group claims abortion restrictions and bans violate this teaching as well as an &ldquo;abortion ritual&rdquo; that its members perform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It likens the &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; slaughter of unborn babies to communion or baptism for Christians. In 2020, it even raffled off an abortion to raise money for its lawsuits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple claims to have 700,000 members internationally, and it is a recognized religion by the IRS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group is deeply involved in abortion advocacy. Breitbart once described its work as a &ldquo;pro-abortion crusade to come to the aid of America&rsquo;s largest abortion provider,&rdquo; Planned Parenthood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the past decade, it has filed numerous lawsuits in different states to overturn pro-life laws, though its attempts thus far have failed. Other recent lawsuits include a challenge to the Texas heartbeat law, which pro-life advocates say has saved tens of thousands of unborn babies&rsquo; lives thus far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple also is pushing its beliefs on young children. Recently, the group began opening clubs in elementary schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, these satanic influences can be seen at pro-abortion rallies where abortion activists chant &ldquo;Hail, Satan!&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;fight like hell&rdquo; has become common among prominent pro-abortion politicians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, earlier this month, New York City leaders erected a golden statue to abortion on top of a city courthouse. Many described the statue, a naked woman with horns, as demonic or satanic.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspects in assassination of Haitian president taken into US custody</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, US officials announced that four suspects in custody for the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Mo&iuml;se on July 7, 2021 were transferred to the United States for their prosecution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CBS News, "The defendants, James Solages, 37, Joseph Vincent, 57, Alejandro Riveria Garcia, 44, and Christian Sanon, 54, are currently being held in US custody. Solages and Vincent, both US citizens from Florida, were arrested in Haiti shortly after the assassination."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 53-year-old Haitian president was shot 12 times and his wife wounded when his assassins entered his home located near Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspects James Solage and Joseph Vincent, the two US citizens, were arrested first after Mo&iuml;se's killing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Post, Christian Sanon, was " an elderly pastor, doctor, and failed businessman that authorities have identified as a key player. His associates have suggested he was duped by the real &mdash; and still unidentified &mdash; masterminds behind the assassination."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandro Garc&iacute;a, the fourth suspect being moved to the US and a Colombian citizen, was a member of the Colombian, as "nearly two dozen former Colombian soldiers charged in the case."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Mo&iuml;se's death, Haiti's gang activity and related violence increased to historic levels. Judges and local officials grew fearful as they received death threats concerning the assassination trial which contributed to the case being stalled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Justice said, Rivera, Solanges, and Vincent were charged with "conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping outside the US and providing material support and resources resulting in death."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanon was charged with "conspiring to smuggle goods from the US and providing unlawful export information," and allegedly moved 20 ballistic protective vests into Haiti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven suspects in total are now in US federal custody awaiting trial for their part in the assassination. The four men recently moved to the US are set to appear in court in Miami on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Post Millennial reported, Solanges, unidentified at the time, said that the assassination attempt was a DEA operation in an effort to solicit compliance from Haitian security guarding the president.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen and Ayesha Curry oppose multi-family development near their $30M home</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Famed NBA marksman Stephen Curry appears more comfortable with 3-point daggers than 3-story developments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with his influencer wife Ayesha, Curry has objected to the establishment of multi-family housing on a property next to his sprawling California mansion, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, the couple told officials in Atherton &mdash; one of the nation&rsquo;s most exclusive enclaves &mdash; that the three-story town houses would encroach on their privacy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routinely vocal on matters of social justice, the Bay Area power couple indicated that joining the well-heeled chorus of objection made them uneasy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We hesitate to add to the &lsquo;not in our backyard&rsquo; (literally) rhetoric, but we wanted to send a note before today&rsquo;s meeting,&rdquo; they wrote on Jan. 18. &ldquo;Safety and privacy for us and our kids continues to be our top priority and one of the biggest reasons we chose to live in Atherton.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home to tech moguls, athletes and international business titans, Atherton officials will reluctantly submit a plan to the state this week outlining their efforts to increase housing density.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parcel in question &mdash; which is nea the Curry residence &mdash; is set to be rezoned in order to accommodate several multi-family units sought by the owner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;With the density being proposed for 23 Oakwood, there are major concerns in terms of both privacy and safety with three-story townhomes looming directly behind us,&rdquo; their email read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple noted that the development would not add to low-income housing to the area, only increase density.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If their municipal buzzer beater falls short, the Currys asked the town to erect &ldquo;considerably taller fencing and landscaping to block sight lines onto our family&rsquo;s property.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple recently sold their prior Atherton home for $31 million and bought their current 17,000 square foot spread for $30 million, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other local heavyweights &mdash; including billionaire investor Marc Andriessen &mdash; have previously lobbied against the introduction of more affordable housing into the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a median home price of more than $7 million, Atherton ranked first on Forbes&rsquo; priciest zip code list last year.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/u-s-surgeon-general-warns-13-years-old-is-too-young-to-join-social-media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/u-s-surgeon-general-warns-13-years-old-is-too-young-to-join-social-media</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Surgeon General Warns 13-Years-Old Is Too Young To Join Social Media</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy believes children 13 years old are too young to join social media platforms, citing kids are still &ldquo;developing their identity,&rdquo; and such engagement can create a distorted sense of themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murthy, who has served as surgeon general under the Obama and the Biden administrations, signaled the warning in an interview with CNN, noting adolescents should only be allowed to access the platforms until they were 16 years old at the earliest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time, you know, early adolescence, where kids are developing their identity, their sense of self,&rdquo; Murthy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time where it&rsquo;s really important for us to be thoughtful about what&rsquo;s going into how they think about their own self-worth and their relationships, and the skewed and often distorted environment of social media often does a disservice to many of those children.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media giant platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter require a minimum age of 13 to join.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murthy further noted the issue with addictive algorithms, which pits youth against Big Tech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You have some of the best designers and product developers in the world who have designed these products to make sure people are maximizing the amount of time they spend on these platforms,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if we tell a child, use the force of your willpower to control how much time you&rsquo;re spending, you&rsquo;re pitting a child against the world&rsquo;s greatest product designers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just not a fair fight,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And so that&rsquo;s why I think our kids need help.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journal of the American Medical Association published a study earlier this month which sampled 178 12-year-olds from three public middle schools in North Carolina and reviewed how often the minors check social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found individuals with habitual checking behaviors showed initial hypoactivation but increasing sensitivity to potential social cues over time. Nonhabitual individuals, however, showed initial hyperactivation and decreasing sensitivity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Adriana Stacey told CNN using social media releases a &ldquo;dopamine dump&rdquo; and compared the addictiveness of smartphones to cocaine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surgeon General Murthy called on parents to band together to prevent their children from logging on to social media platforms until they&rsquo;re at least 16 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Public School District officials filed a lawsuit earlier this month against several social media platform owners, including Facebook and TikTok, for allegedly intentionally cultivating and creating a mental health crisis among the youth and have caused a public nuisance affecting Seattle Public Schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden drew attention to social media platforms in his 2022 State of the Union Address, alleging the harm social media has wrought on American youth should implore all to &ldquo;hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they&rsquo;re conducting on our children for profit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration &amp; General Murthy took fire howewver, due to what appears to be inconscistencies in their rules.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told "CNN Newsroom" host Pamela Brown that parents should look to push back the age at which their children begin using social media platforms to make sure kids "don't get exposed to harm early."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last March, Murthy addressed a directive from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, R., effectively cutting gender-affirming care for minors in his state, taking to Twitter to write, "Yesterday afternoon in Austin, I met with transgender youth and their parents to hear how they are coping in light of the state's recent directive equating gender-affirming care to child abuse."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The pain and fear in their voices was heartbreaking. Parents and kids are terrified about being separated. They described repeated attacks on their families at traumatic&hellip; LGBTQ+ youth were already at increased risk of suicide and other mental health struggles. We should be seeking to provide them with support and medical care&hellip;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Forcing parents to choose between following medical advice for their child and risking an investigation from the state is simply not right. The government shouldn't be interfering with decisions between doctors and patients," he continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/border-patrol-agents-told-to-not-chase-all-vehicles-that-flee_5022784.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/border-patrol-agents-told-to-not-chase-all-vehicles-that-flee_5022784.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol Agents Told to Not Chase All Vehicles That Flee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas&mdash;Border Patrol agents will soon be limited in chasing vehicles that flee from them, under new rules unveiled in January and set to take effect in May.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents must determine that vehicular pursuits are &ldquo;necessary and objectively reasonable&rdquo; under the rules, and can terminate a pursuit at any time without fear of questioning from superiors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents are being told that they must consider factors such as &ldquo;the seriousness of the reason&rdquo; for a pursuit and weather conditions when deciding whether to chase a fleeing vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint or port of entry&mdash;the official places to enter the United States from Mexico and Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A Vehicular Pursuit is considered Necessary when an Authorized Officer/Agent concludes there is an immediate need to apprehend a subject as part of their enforcement duties based on the totality of the known facts and circumstances,&rdquo; the rules state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pursuit meets the &ldquo;objectively reasonable&rdquo; standard when the government&rsquo;s interest in apprehending the persons or people in the fleeing vehicle &ldquo;clearly outweighs the Foreseeability of Risk to the public, officers/agents, other law enforcement, and vehicle occupants,&rdquo; the rules state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents must evaluate the interest and the potential risk when choosing whether to pursue a fleeing vehicle and continue the evaluation during the chase. They must also alert a supervisor &ldquo;as soon as feasible&rdquo; during a pursuit and immediately terminate the chase if the supervisor does not authorize it to continue, or orders it stopped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a chase is terminated, agents must pull their vehicle over to signal to the public and the fleeing driver that the chase has ended, according to the rules. They must alert superiors. They can then start driving again in the last known direction of the fleeing vehicle to check for &ldquo;crashes, potential flight on foot, to determine if the Subject Vehicle was abandoned, or for any other incident.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules also suggest alternatives to vehicular pursuits, such as tracking with airplanes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troy Miller, who became acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner in late 2022 after the ouster of Chris Magnus, said that vehicular pursuits &ldquo;pose inherent risks&mdash;to members of the public, officers and agents, and vehicle occupants&rdquo; and that the new policy &ldquo;acknowledges these risks and shifts our Agency&rsquo;s overall approach to a risk-based model when it comes to pursuits.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnus stressed that the policy does not bar vehicular pursuits but &ldquo;provides a clear framework&rdquo; for weighing the risks associated with pursuits against the benefits.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://hotair.com/tree-hugging-sister/2023/01/30/florida-taking-the-first-steps-to-become-26th-constitutional-carry-state-n527375"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/tree-hugging-sister/2023/01/30/florida-taking-the-first-steps-to-become-26th-constitutional-carry-state-n527375</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida taking the first steps to become 26th constitutional carry state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speaker of the Florida House announced lawmakers had filed the bill this morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida lawmakers&rsquo; promise to introduce legislation allowing permitless concealed carry of firearms, called &ldquo;Constitutional Carry&rdquo; by proponents, has been met. At a Monday morning press briefing, House Speaker Paul Renner (R-Palm Coast) and other gathered lawmakers announced House Bill 543, which would allow weapons and firearms without a license for concealment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed bill was written by Rep. Chuck Brannan (R-Lake City), with state Sen. Jay Collins (R-Tampa) writing the companion legislation for the Florida Senate. Gov. Ron DeSantis said in December that he was committed to the legislation passing and urged state lawmakers to propose it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed bill, Floridians would no longer need to apply for a license for concealed carry. The state of Florida already allows firearm purchases for those 21 and older without need of state application, aside from federal requirements for background checks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the bill pass, the regulation of concealed carry permits, handled by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, would end.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York hotel mobbed by illegal migrants who refuse to leave</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal aliens standing outside of the Watson Hotel in New York's Hell's Kitchen district on Sunday night refused to leave for a new shelter, causing police to mobilize.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 50 migrants were outside of the hotel, along with activists who were handing out food and water.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials said that single men were supposed to be brought to a new shelter at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal that would provide the same services that they were receiving at the hotel. The city bus arrived, but only a small number of migrants hopped on the bus. Most decided to stay outside the hotel on West 57th Street. Activists claimed that migrants were being relocated from the hotel. One activist was quoted telling the New York Post that they were prepared to stay overnight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dozen police were originally stationed at the Watson hotel, with police remaining on-scene until around midnight as migrants were still surrounding the entrance of the hotel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brooklyn Cruise Terminal is a new mega shelter that can house as many as 1,000 single adult men, Mayor Eric Adams said last week.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/suicide-bomber-breaches-high-security-in-pakistan-mosque-kills-59"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/suicide-bomber-breaches-high-security-in-pakistan-mosque-kills-59</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now in world news&hellip; Suicide bomber breaches high security in Pakistan mosque, kills 59</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A suicide bomber blew himself up inside a crowded mosque in a highly fortified security compound in Pakistan on Monday, killing 59 people, the latest attack by resurgent Islamist militants targeting police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attacker appeared to have passed through several barricades manned by security forces to get into the &ldquo;Red Zone&rdquo; compound that houses police and counter-terrorism offices in the volatile northwestern city of Peshawar, police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the 170 wounded people were in critical condition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll rose to 59 after several people succumbed to their wounds, hospital official Mohammad Asim said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bombing happened a day before an International Monetary Fund mission to Islamabad to initiate talks on unlocking funding for the South Asian country&rsquo;s economy, which is enduring a balance of payments crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bomber detonated his load at the moment hundreds of people lined up to say their prayers, officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have found traces of explosives,&rdquo; Khan told reporters, adding that a security lapse had clearly occurred as the bomber had slipped through the most secured area of the compound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An inquiry was under way into how the attacker breached such an elite security cordon and whether there was any inside help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US military operation kills senior ISIS leader in Somalia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN - A US military operation killed a senior ISIS leader and 10 members of the terror group in northern Somalia on Wednesday, two senior Biden administration officials said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;From a mountainous cave complex in northern Somalia, Bilal al-Sudani is assessed to have supported ISIS&rsquo; expansion and activities across Africa and beyond the continent,&rdquo; the first senior administration official said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed that al-Sudani had been killed in a statement later on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;On January 25, on orders from the President, the U.S. military conducted an assault operation in northern Somalia that resulted in the death of a number of ISIS members, including Bilal-al-Sudani, an ISIS leader in Somalia and a key facilitator for ISIS&rsquo;s global network. Al-Sudani was responsible for fostering the growing presence of ISIS in Africa and for funding the group&rsquo;s operations worldwide, including in Afghanistan,&rdquo; Austin said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No civilians were harmed as a result of this operation. We are grateful to our extraordinary service members as well as our intelligence community and other interagency partners for their support to this successful counterterrorism operation,&rdquo; Austin added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US forces, according to the official, were prepared to capture al-Sudani but the &ldquo;hostile force&rsquo;s response&rdquo; ultimately resulted in his death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No US troops or civilians were killed, although one service member was injured during the operation after being bitten by an American military dog.The second official said that the US notified two counterterrorism partners, including the Somali government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unusual for the US to carry out an operation against ISIS in Somalia, where military operations have typically focused on al-Shabaab fighters, the dominant terror group in Somalia. The strike comes after US forces killed two top ISIS leaders in an airstrike in Syria near the end of last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation represents the continuation of the Biden administration&rsquo;s strategy to counter terrorist threats through &ldquo;over-the-horizon&rdquo; operations like this, a shift in strategy the president made clear following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al-Sudani was sanctioned by the US treasury in 2012 for helping foreign fighters travel to an al-Shabaab training camp and facilitating financing, according to the first official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation, according to the first official, is expected to provide &ldquo;valuable information&rdquo; for the US intelligence community, although they declined to go into specifics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation was announced by US Africa Command (AFRICOM) on Thursday, which said only that the US military &ldquo;conducted a successful counterterrorism operation in Somalia&rdquo; and that &ldquo;no civilians were injured or killed.&rdquo; The second senior administration official said on Thursday that senior members of President Joe Biden&rsquo;s national security team were first briefed on the intelligence that led to this operation a &ldquo;number of months ago.&rdquo; Biden authorized the operation earlier this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first official declined to provide details on the service members who were involved in the operation but emphasized their &ldquo;exceptional preparation&rdquo; for the mission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-official-pushed-ban-gas-stoves-calls-anger-misdirected"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-official-pushed-ban-gas-stoves-calls-anger-misdirected</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden official who pushed to ban gas stoves calls anger over it &lsquo;misdirected&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. pushed back against the firestorm his comments about banning gas stoves created, calling the anger "misdirected."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When you learn upsetting new information about something you&rsquo;ve been around for a long time &mdash; maybe your whole life &mdash; you can never predict people&rsquo;s reactions," he said. "And there is going to be justifiable anger, and sometimes it&rsquo;s misdirected," he told The Washington Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trumka was appointed by President Biden in 2021 and is the son of labor union leader, Richard Trumka, the longtime president of AFL-CIO.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden official admitted to the paper that his work and experience as a father made him "paranoid" about every day hazards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s very easy to see how everyday things can be hazardous," Trumka said to the outlet adding later, "I&rsquo;m much more paranoid than the average person."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Biden official hoped the national debate over gas stoves caused more people to be aware of how their indoor appliances could be causing health risks due to pollution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Post noted that the Consumer Product Safety Commission is in "the very early stages" of determining regulations on new gas stoves, after "years of research" has found they emit nitrogen dioxide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when asked by Fox News Digital, the government agency could not provide any specific studies that backed up these claims to justify a ban on these products.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bans against stoves have started at the local and state level. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed abolishing the sale of gas-powered appliances and banning their installation in new buildings by 2025.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and far-left environmental groups are pushing to regulate several other household appliances, from water heaters to furnaces, to washing machines to microwaves and shower heads in their quest to get Americans away from fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We&rsquo;re actually going to do 100 rules this year alone on appliances," former top White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said during a speech last May. "We are developing partnerships on how we work together for new building standards."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when news broke earlier this month that the Biden administration was considering a ban on gas stoves, it created a backlash from the public, restaurant owners and Republicans who slammed the move as an example of government overreach.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/katie-hobbs-to-bus-illegal-immigrants-out-of-arizona-wont-say-where-they-are-going?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/katie-hobbs-to-bus-illegal-immigrants-out-of-arizona-wont-say-where-they-are-going?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie Hobbs to bus illegal immigrants out of Arizona, won't say where they are going</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is continuing her Republican predecessor Doug Ducey&rsquo;s program to bus illegal migrants out of the state, but in a way that she says will be more "efficient and humane."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs told The Arizona Republic on Tuesday that her administration would focus on ensuring that the program and associated costs were "efficient and humane."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ducey began busing the illegal migrants out of the state in May, and Hobbs has expanded the program to include an option of chartered air travel, according to an updated contract signed on January 14. Over 3,000 people were bused from the Yuma area to Washington DC during Ducey&rsquo;s time in office, costing the state over $7 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Republican lawmakers had earmarked $15 million for the program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, a Yuma official warned that the city is on the brink of collapse due to being overwhelmed by illegal migrants thanks to the Biden administration's failed immigration policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The border has seen a historic crisis under President Joe Biden's presidency. Illegal border crossings in December reached their highest level of the Biden administration, topping 250,000 in the final month of 2022 continuing the pattern of breaking records every month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs told reporters last week regarding the bussing: "We need to look at that practice and make sure it&rsquo;s effective, [that] it&rsquo;s something that supports local communities. If we&rsquo;re spending the money to bus people, why not just get them to their final destination?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs told The Arizona Republic that her actions would be different than the methods of Republican governors Greg Abbott, of Texas, and Ron DeSantis, of Florida, who both have transported migrants to Democratic-run cities to showcase the failure of Biden&rsquo;s border policies. An updated contract removed the requirement that buses with illegal immigrants must be sent to Washington, DC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Washington, DC's Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a public emergency related to the migrants being bussed to the US capital. Democratic New York Mayor Eric Adams declared that there is no more room for illegal immigrants in the city despite its status as a "sanctuary city" for migrants, and called on the federal government to solve the crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs added, "We're interested in focusing on the humanitarian aspects of this and just putting people on a bus as a political stunt and sending them to Martha's Vineyard or wherever they went is not providing any help or any solution to the actual issue."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN&rsquo;s Primetime Viewership Plummets to Just 444,000 as Don Lemon Hits Record Low</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And no, it wasn&rsquo;t a slow new week. Between the classified documents scandal, Ukraine, and the roil over House committee seats, CNN had plenty to report on, or should we say &lsquo;spin.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Fox News raked in an n average of 1.996 million primetime viewers during that week, five times more than CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSNBC faired better than CNN, attracting nearly a million with 943,000 average primetime viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN barely cracked 400,000 with just 417,000 in total day viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News more than tripled that with 1.387 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSNBC did better but still only averaged 629,000 total viewers throughout the day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 25-54 age demographic that sets advertiser rates, Fox News averaged 256,000 demo viewers, MSNBC averaged just 91,000, and CNN did just 93,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News averaged 176,000 demo viewers throughout the day and came in a distant second with 80,000, and MSNBC came in last with 69,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For cable news, which set a baseline for success for 100,000 demo viewers, CNN and MSNBC are failing miserably.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all of cable, Fox News came in second behind ESPN in total primetime viewers, MSNBC third, and CNN eighteenth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newly-installed Chris Licht was supposed to turn CNN back into a network viewers wanted to watch, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, CNN sucks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As previously reported, Lemon was demoted from his primetime show to save CNN&rsquo;s failed morning show. With Lemon on board, New Day became CNN This Morning, and that became a catastrophe that averaged only 331,000 viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that time, Fox News attracted 1.3 million and 180,000 demo viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Lemon sunk to only 65,000 demo viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN has been a national joke for quite a while, but now it&rsquo;s official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2023/01/26/biden-makes-first-move-toward-a-radical-national-rent-control-law-n1665210"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2023/01/26/biden-makes-first-move-toward-a-radical-national-rent-control-law-n1665210</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Makes First Move Toward a Radical National Rent Control Law</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to a letter sent earlier this month by congressional radicals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urging the president to take executive action to prevent evictions and lower rent prices,&nbsp; Joe Biden has initiated a series of actions that will eventually lead to a national rent control law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning of the republic, laws governing rent and leases have been local matters. If a landlord is cheating renters, local and state governments have the authority and the tools to punish the landlord. And being much closer to the problems of renters and landlords than anyone in Washington, local and state governments have a much better handle on the local rental housing situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, the federal government doesn&rsquo;t believe that landlords should be compensated for owning rental property. They&rsquo;re &ldquo;gouging&rdquo; renters. This is after more than two years of preventing landlords from evicting renters for non-payment of rent. And in a period of rapidly rising inflation, landlords are being accused of &ldquo;profiteering&rdquo; at the expense of renters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s a ridiculous charge given that 98 percent of all rental property owners, or 80 percent of all rental properties, are owned by small business entrepreneurs who own five units or fewer, according to a study in Business Wire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rules, and any legislation supported by AOC, would destroy the rental housing market and make it much harder to find affordable housing. What small business owner wants to be beholden to Washington for their business? Rental housing will disappear &mdash; perhaps the intended purpose of the new rules.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrative of corporate greed being responsible for rent increases is a far easier sell than small businesses struggling to keep their properties during an inflationary economy that Warren, AOC, and Biden are mostly responsible for.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/idaho-massacre-suspect-had-job-interview-with-same-police-department-that-aided-in-his-arrest?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/idaho-massacre-suspect-had-job-interview-with-same-police-department-that-aided-in-his-arrest?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho massacre suspect had job interview with same police department that aided in his arrest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Kohbeger, the 28-year-old PhD criminology student suspected of murdering four University of Idaho students in November, reportedly met with the police chief of the same department that helped track him across the country, ultimately leading to his arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The New York Times, the Washington State University student met with Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins on April 12, 2022, according to emails the publication obtained. Hours after the meeting, Kohberger followed up with Jenkins, writing "It was a great pleasure to meet with you today and share my thoughts and excitement regarding the research assistantship for public safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publication reported that the accused killer was looking to land a three-year research assistant position in public safety, which was being offered through WSU's doctorate program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Edition reported that the job description posted by the school stated that "the purpose of these positions is to support each agency through data management and analysis, and to position them for success when they seek external funding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently unknown if Kohberger landed the position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also unclear if this research role is the same position referenced in Kohberger's probable cause affidavit, which claims that he "wrote an essay when he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in the fall of 2022."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the affidavit, Kohberger "had an interest in assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technical data in public safety operations."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brutal stabbing murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, all students at the University of Idaho, led law enforcement on a cross-country chase all the way to Kohberger's hometown in Pennsylvania. According to the Post Millenial, It was the Pullman police department that collaborated with federal law enforcement in tracking the suspect after he left Moscow, Idaho.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hate-crime-hoax-idaho-police-white-power-graffiti-high-school-created-rival-hispanic-gangs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/hate-crime-hoax-idaho-police-white-power-graffiti-high-school-created-rival-hispanic-gangs</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate crime hoax: Idaho police say 'White Power' graffiti on high school created by 'rival' Hispanic gangs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Idaho police department determined that "White Power" graffiti found at a local high school was not an act of hate, but an "act of intimidation" between two "rival Hispanic criminal street gangs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At this time, detectives no longer believe the incident to be motivated by hate but rather an act of intimidation between two rival Hispanic criminal street gangs from Caldwell," the Caldwell Police Department said on Facebook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Detectives are basing this off of evidence, video, and other factors discovered in the course of the investigation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words "White Power" were found spray-painted on the side of Caldwell High School last Thursday, two days after the high school held a "Brown Pride" protest, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Tuesday protest was held in support of a student who was told to remove a hooded sweatshirt reading "Brown Pride" because other people reportedly found it "racist," the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School officials reportedly compared the phrase to a "white pride" shirt, according to the student who was told to remove the shirt, Brenda Hernandez. She ultimately turned the hoodie inside-out so the phrase could not be seen while she was on school property.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell High School principal Anita Wilson said at the time that the school has a strict dress code "compared to other school districts because Caldwell has had a gang problem before, and 'Brown Pride' is associated with gangs."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the graffiti was found Thursday, the police chief denounced what at the time appeared to be an act of hate, saying "we will not tolerate hate in our city and will ensure that whoever is responsible for this will be held accountable for their actions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, police provided an update that the graffiti vandalism is believed to be a "diversion tactic" used by one of the Hispanic gangs in the area to avoid being caught by police, and "was possibly done to exploit the recent protest at Caldwell High School."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police posted screenshots of surveillance footage from the night the school was vandalized, showing individuals wearing black masks and hoodies standing near a wall while holding what appears to be spray paint. Police said they believe two groups of four people, or a total of eight suspects, arrived in two separate cars on Thursday to graffiti the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell Chief of Police Rex Ingram lauded his department for its investigation and vowed to track down those responsible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A police spokesperson further clarified to Fox News Digital Monday that the department believes the vandalism is gang related as it is "consistent with gang activity and we&rsquo;ve identified the tagging as consistent with gangs in the area."

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenient Timing: Pelosi Sold $3 Million of Google Stock Weeks Before DOJ Launched Antitrust Probe</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and her multimillionaire husband sold up to $3 million in shares of Google in recent weeks&mdash;just before the Biden Justice Department launched an antitrust probe of the tech giant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pelosi sold 30,000 shares of Google from Dec. 20 to Dec. 28, according to a financial disclosure filing the former House speaker submitted to the House Ethics Committee. The Pelosis made an undisclosed profit from the investments, according to the filing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trade proved timely. On Monday, the Justice Department and attorneys general from eight states&mdash;including California&mdash;sued Google over its monopoly on the digital ad market. The lawsuit could force Google to break up its online ad business, which generated nearly $55 billion in revenue for the company in the most recent quarter. Google's stock has dropped around 6 percent since the Justice Department announced the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trades are the latest in a string of questionable transactions for Paul and Nancy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They saved roughly $600,000 in June by selling shares of microchip maker Nvidia weeks before the U.S. government placed restrictions on the company's business in China and Russia. The Pelosis have seen their fortune grow $140 million since 2008, thanks largely to Paul Pelosi's stock trades, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi's stock market charades have sparked calls for tougher regulations on members of Congress cashing in on their positions of power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) on Tuesday introduced the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act&mdash;the PELOSI Act&mdash;to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US joins Germany in sending tanks to Ukraine as Biden hails &lsquo;united&rsquo; effort</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden has approved sending 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a significant escalation in the US effort to counter Russian aggression as international reluctance to send tanks to the battlefront falls away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reversal of the US&rsquo;s previous position came after Germany confirmed it will make 14 of its Leopard 2A6 tanks available for Ukraine&rsquo;s war effort, and give partner countries its permission to re-export other battle tanks to aid Kyiv.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By agreeing to send the Abrams, the US is able to meet the demand of the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for an American commitment but without having to send the tanks immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden added: &ldquo;We remain united and determined as ever in our conviction and our cause. These tanks are further evidence of our enduring, unflagging commitment to Ukraine and our confidence in the skill of the Ukrainian forces.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&rsquo;s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy applauded Biden for the &ldquo;powerful decision to provide Abrams,&rdquo; declaring on Twitter that &ldquo;the free world is united as never before&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, the president had spoken by phone with president Emmanuel Macron of France, Scholz of Germany, prime minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy and prime minister Rishi Sunak of Britain. Biden said: &ldquo;Germany has really stepped up. The chancellor&rsquo;s been a strong, strong voice for unity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In public statements, Washington and Berlin had denied any connection between their respective decisions on tanks, although media reports said German officials had made clear in private that the Leopards were conditional on the US making a similar commitment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a minority of parents emphasize passing on their faith to children:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Christianity Today: While mental health concerns top the list of worries for parents today, and studies suggest religion is good for mental health, passing on their religious beliefs to their children is not highly prioritized by US adults with children younger than 18, new data from the Pew Research Center show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across racial and ethnic lines, overwhelming majorities of U.S. adults with children younger than 18 believe being a parent is either one of or the most important aspect of who they are as a person. But when it comes to prioritizing the passing on of their faith to their children, white Evangelicals and black Protestants are the only two Christian groups where a majority of parents prioritize this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Parents place less importance on their children growing up to have religious or political beliefs that are similar to their own. About a third (35%) say it is extremely or very important to them that their children share their religious beliefs, and 16% say the same about their children's political beliefs," Pew researchers Rachel Minkin and Juliana Horowitz said in Parenting in America Today released on Tuesday. "Republican and Democratic parents are about equally likely to say it's at least very important to them that their children share their political beliefs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data for Parenting in America Today came from some 3,757 U.S. parents with children younger than 18, which was collected as part of a larger survey conducted from Sept. 20 to Oct. 2, 2022, to better understand how American parents approach parenting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 40% of black parents and 39% of Hispanic parents in the study told researchers that it's extremely or very important to them that their children share their religious beliefs. That share is even lower among white and Asian parents where only 32% say it's important that their children share the same religion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results of a survey of nearly 10,000 young people ages 13-25 about their beliefs, practices, behaviors, relationships and mental health published last October by Springtide Research Institute in The State of Religion &amp; Young People 2022: Mental Health&ndash;What Faith Leaders Need to Know, it was found that during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, 53% of respondents reported that mental health was their biggest challenge. Yet only 34% reported being comfortable talking about their struggle with adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 57% said new spiritual practices helped them endure the pandemic and more than half (51%) said they turned to prayer. Others turned to activities like reading, yoga, the arts or being in nature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that while religion and spirituality "can be strong antidotes to much of what contributes to mental-health struggles among young people" and that "people who are religious are better off mentally and emotionally," only 35% of the respondents said they are connected to a religious community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents connected to a religious community were found to be more likely to say they are "flourishing a lot" in their mental and emotional well-being (29%) than those not connected to a religious community (20%).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents who say they are "very religious" were more likely to report that they are "flourishing a lot" (40%) compared to those who say they are not religious (17%). Respondents who are "not religious" were more than twice as likely to say they are "not flourishing" (44%) than "very religious" respondents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study appeared to confirm decades of previous research pointing to a positive relationship between religion, spirituality and mental health.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho massacre suspect had job interview with same police department that aided in his arrest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Kohbeger, the 28-year-old PhD criminology student suspected of murdering four University of Idaho students in November, reportedly met with the police chief of the same department that helped track him across the country, ultimately leading to his arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The New York Times, the Washington State University student met with Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins on April 12, 2022, according to emails the publication obtained. Hours after the meeting, Kohberger followed up with Jenkins, writing "It was a great pleasure to meet with you today and share my thoughts and excitement regarding the research assistantship for public safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publication reported that the accused killer was looking to land a three-year research assistant position in public safety, which was being offered through WSU's doctorate program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Edition reported that the job description posted by the school stated that "the purpose of these positions is to support each agency through data management and analysis, and to position them for success when they seek external funding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently unknown if Kohberger landed the position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also unclear if this research role is the same position referenced in Kohberger's probable cause affidavit, which claims that he "wrote an essay when he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in the fall of 2022."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the affidavit, Kohberger "had an interest in assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technical data in public safety operations."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brutal stabbing murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, all students at the University of Idaho, led law enforcement on a cross-country chase all the way to Kohberger's hometown in Pennsylvania. According to the Post Millenial, It was the Pullman police department that collaborated with federal law enforcement in tracking the suspect after he left Moscow, Idaho.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate crime hoax: Idaho police say 'White Power' graffiti on high school created by 'rival' Hispanic gangs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Idaho police department determined that "White Power" graffiti found at a local high school was not an act of hate, but an "act of intimidation" between two "rival Hispanic criminal street gangs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At this time, detectives no longer believe the incident to be motivated by hate but rather an act of intimidation between two rival Hispanic criminal street gangs from Caldwell," the Caldwell Police Department said on Facebook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Detectives are basing this off of evidence, video, and other factors discovered in the course of the investigation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words "White Power" were found spray-painted on the side of Caldwell High School last Thursday, two days after the high school held a "Brown Pride" protest, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Tuesday protest was held in support of a student who was told to remove a hooded sweatshirt reading "Brown Pride" because other people reportedly found it "racist," the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School officials reportedly compared the phrase to a "white pride" shirt, according to the student who was told to remove the shirt, Brenda Hernandez. She ultimately turned the hoodie inside-out so the phrase could not be seen while she was on school property.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell High School principal Anita Wilson said at the time that the school has a strict dress code "compared to other school districts because Caldwell has had a gang problem before, and 'Brown Pride' is associated with gangs."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the graffiti was found Thursday, the police chief denounced what at the time appeared to be an act of hate, saying "we will not tolerate hate in our city and will ensure that whoever is responsible for this will be held accountable for their actions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, police provided an update that the graffiti vandalism is believed to be a "diversion tactic" used by one of the Hispanic gangs in the area to avoid being caught by police, and "was possibly done to exploit the recent protest at Caldwell High School."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police posted screenshots of surveillance footage from the night the school was vandalized, showing individuals wearing black masks and hoodies standing near a wall while holding what appears to be spray paint. Police said they believe two groups of four people, or a total of eight suspects, arrived in two separate cars on Thursday to graffiti the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell Chief of Police Rex Ingram lauded his department for its investigation and vowed to track down those responsible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A police spokesperson further clarified to Fox News Digital Monday that the department believes the vandalism is gang related as it is "consistent with gang activity and we&rsquo;ve identified the tagging as consistent with gangs in the area." The spokesperson added that the department has additional evidence, but is not releasing the details as the investigation is ongoing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">49ers' Brock Purdy receives praise for keeping his faith in the picture ahead of NFC title</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco 49ers rising star Brock Purdy is on the brink of making history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quarterback could become the first rookie to lead his team to a Super Bowl appearance. He&rsquo;s the latest rookie quarterback to guide his team to a conference championship. And while Purdy has won each of the seven games he&rsquo;s started, he&rsquo;s receiving praise for another reason &mdash; putting faith first.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former Iowa State standout has been open about his religion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rev. Franklin Graham, CEO of Samaritan's Purse and of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, was the latest to congratulate Purdy after his win over the Dallas Cowboys and noted his openness about his belief in God and Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They&rsquo;re now just one game away from the Super Bowl! In addition to being a super talented football player, I love the fact that Brock Purdy is so open about his faith in Jesus Christ," Graham wrote Monday in a Facebook post, adding that he was rooting for the 49ers to win the Super Bowl.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the days leading up to the game against the Cowboys, Purdy explained to reporters how he was just trying to stay in the moment amid all the attention swirling around him and his team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdy also opened up to Sports Spectrum in 2021 about his faith. He said that while at Iowa State, he asked God to forgive him for putting the sport he loved ahead of his relationship with God.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Policies to Burden American Businesses With Higher Taxes This Year</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses in the United States are set to face a bigger federal tax burden in 2023 due to Democrat policies and the phasing out of Republican tax overhauls, combined with an expected raise in corporate minimum tax for billion-dollar companies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included several changes due to which businesses will face higher taxes. In addition, some of the temporary provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted under the Trump administration are set to get phased out in 2023. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the total effect of these two developments would result in additional tax increases of $115 billion for businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new corporate minimum tax charges a 15 percent levy on American businesses that make more than $1 billion in book income in a year for three consecutive years. As a result, the average effective tax rate on corporate income is expected to rise from 18.7 percent to 19.3 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 200 of America&rsquo;s biggest companies with more than $1 billion in profits are likely to be affected by the corporate minimum tax. They usually pay less than the 21 percent tax typically charged on firms. In addition, the minimum tax rule will also apply to foreign firms that generate over $100 billion in book income in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that meet the conditions under this new tax policy must calculate their taxes in two ways: under the 15 percent corporate minimum tax rule and the 21 percent income tax rule. They must then pay the higher tax. Businesses operating in sectors like mining and real estate are expected to be the hardest hit by this change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock buyback tax levies a 1 percent charge on publicly traded firms when they repurchase stocks. Some experts estimate that this tax will end up forcing businesses to maintain more cash on their company books when the money could have gone for investment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategists at UBS calculate the two taxes will be a drag on company earnings this year, estimating a 1.5 percent decrease per share in firms listed on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Hawley to Propose Legislation Banning TikTok Nationwide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said on Tuesday he will introduce legislation to ban TikTok nationwide, charging that it violates the privacy of Americans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley for years has moved to rein in TikTok.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sens. Hawley and Rick Scott (R-F) proposed legislation in March 2020 that would ban TikTok from all federal government devices, citing cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Chinese government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress passed Hawley&rsquo;s bill to ban TikTok, which was signed into law on December 29, 2022. The bill was included in the $1.7 trillion, 4,155-page omnibus spending bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley has questioned tech executives about their companies&rsquo; potential compliance with Chinese law that could provide the Chinese Communist Party access to data that could endanger Americans&rsquo; privacy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public officials and pundits across the political spectrum have contended that TikTok amounts to a national security concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1191863214096703489"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1191863214096703489</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play 0:00-0:50</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Hawley and Scott proposed their legislation to ban TikTok on federal government devices, many states, such as Georgia, Montana, Alabama, and Iowa, have moved to ban the controversial Chinese social media app off of their state government devices.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President Mike Pence discovered classified documents in Indiana home</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President Mike Pence informed Congress on Tuesday that he discovered documents bearing classified markings from his time as vice president in his Carmel, Indiana, home on Jan. 16.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the revelations that classified documents from President Joe Biden's tenure as vice president were found at the Penn Biden Center think tank and Wilmington, Delaware, Pence's team conducted searches of Pence's Indiana home and the office of his political advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his team, Pence informed the National Archives on Jan. 18 that a small number of potential classified documents were found in two small boxes. Another two boxes contained copies of vice presidential papers. The National Archives then informed the FBI, per standard procedure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence attorney Greg Jacob wrote on Jan. 18 to Acting Director Kate Dillon McClure of the White House Liaison Division National Archives and Records Administration to inform her of the papers "containing classified markings."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the documents with classified markings were discovered, they were immediately put into a safe, according to the Pence team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documents were collected by the FBI at Pence's home in Carmel, Indiana, on Thursday evening, Jan. 19. Pence was in Washington, D.C., for the annual March for Life when the FBI collected the documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence's team said that although the documents bear classified markings, the Department of Justice or the agency that issued the documents will need to make a final determination on whether the documents are considered classified or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a letter from Jacob to Chief Operating Officer William Bosanko of the National Archives and Records Administration on Jan. 22, the DOJ departed from its standard procedures that it ran with Biden when it requested direct possession of the documents on Jan. 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other documents that were not identified as potential classified documents were driven from Indiana to the National Archives in Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No classified docs were found at Pence's Advancing American Freedom office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Oversight Committee confirmed to Fox News Digital that Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., was notified by Pence's team Tuesday regarding the discovery of classified documents in his personal residence.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British MPs call for probe into massive spike in deaths</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 3,000 more Britons are dying than average on a weekly basis, and it&rsquo;s not Covid-19 that&rsquo;s responsible</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubled by national statistics showing 20% excess deaths per week, UK MPs have demanded an investigation, the Daily Mail reported on Tuesday. Unlike the last time excess deaths reached such levels, during the second Covid-19 wave, few of these deaths could be attributed to the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking before the House of Commons on Tuesday, Conservative MP Esther McVey skewered Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty for blaming the spike in non-Covid excess deaths on &ldquo;patients not getting statins or blood pressure medicines during the pandemic,&rdquo; pointing out that the monthly figures for statin prescriptions had remained constant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Where is the evidence? And if there isn&rsquo;t one, what is causing these excess deaths?&rdquo; she asked, demanding the minister &ldquo;commit to an urgent and thorough investigation of the matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour shadow public health minister Andrew Gwynne described health secretary Steve Barclay as &ldquo;part man, part ostrich&rdquo; over his refusal to confront the issue, accusing PM Rishi Sunak&rsquo;s government of &ldquo;denial and buck-passing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There were 50,000 more deaths than we would have otherwise expected in 2022,&rdquo; he told the House of Commons on Tuesday. &ldquo;Excluding the pandemic, that&rsquo;s the worst figure since 1951.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Office for National Statistics, 2,837 more people died in the second week of January than normal in England and Wales, with just 5% of those deaths being attributable to Covid-19.e</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time excess deaths were so high, during the second week of February 2021, Covid-19 deaths made up 37% of the total. Nor is the statistic an outlier &ndash; the last two weeks of December saw 21% and 20% excess deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal College of Emergency Medicine reported as many as 500 people a week are dying because they cannot receive emergency treatment in time. A record 54,532 people waited more than 12 hours in emergency departments to actually be admitted to the hospital once the decision was made to admit them, according to NHS data, and only 65% of patients were seen within four hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Whitty warned that &ldquo;postponement of elective and semi-elective care and screening&rdquo; due to lockdowns and NHS delays would result in another wave of mortality after Covid-19 had largely subsided, with undiagnosed cancers and other chronic conditions claiming a larger than usual number of victims.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrats consider wealth tax &mdash; including for people who moved out of state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California lawmakers are pushing legislation that would impose a new tax on the state's wealthiest residents &mdash; even if they've already moved to another part of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblyman Alex Lee, a progressive Democrat, last week introduced a bill in the California State Legislature that would impose an extra annual 1.5% tax on those with a "worldwide net worth" above $1 billion, starting as early as January 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 2026, the threshold for being taxed would drop: those with a worldwide net worth exceeding $50 million would be hit with a 1% annual tax on wealth, while billionaires would still be taxed 1.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide wealth extends beyond annual income to include diverse holdings such as farm assets, arts and other collectibles, and stocks and hedge fund interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is a modified version of a wealth tax approved in the California Assembly in 2020, which the Democrat-led state Senate declined to pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current version just introduced includes measures to allow California to impose wealth taxes on residents even years after they left the state and moved elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exit taxes aren't new in California. But this bill also includes provisions to create contractual claims tied to the assets of a wealthy taxpayer who doesn't have the cash to pay their annual wealth tax bill because most of their assets aren't easily turned into cash. This claim would require the taxpayer to make annual filings with California's Franchise Tax Board and eventually pay the wealth taxes owed, even if they've moved to another state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California was one of several blue states last week to unveil bills to impose new wealth taxes. The other states were Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York and Washington. Each state's proposal contained a different tax approach, but they all centered around the same basic idea: the rich must pay more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. However, he's made public statements echoing the message that wealthier residents should pay higher taxes.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Hawley to Propose Legislation Banning TikTok Nationwide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said on Tuesday he will introduce legislation to ban TikTok nationwide, charging that it violates the privacy of Americans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley for years has moved to rein in TikTok.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sens. Hawley and Rick Scott (R-F) proposed legislation in March 2020 that would ban TikTok from all federal government devices, citing cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Chinese government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress passed Hawley&rsquo;s bill to ban TikTok, which was signed into law on December 29, 2022. The bill was included in the $1.7 trillion, 4,155-page omnibus spending bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley has questioned tech executives about their companies&rsquo; potential compliance with Chinese law that could provide the Chinese Communist Party access to data that could endanger Americans&rsquo; privacy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public officials and pundits across the political spectrum have contended that TikTok amounts to a national security concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Hawley and Scott proposed their legislation to ban TikTok on federal government devices, many states, such as Georgia, Montana, Alabama, and Iowa, have moved to ban the controversial Chinese social media app off of their state government devices.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President Mike Pence discovered classified documents in Indiana home</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President Mike Pence informed Congress on Tuesday that he discovered documents bearing classified markings from his time as vice president in his Carmel, Indiana, home on Jan. 16.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the revelations that classified documents from President Joe Biden's tenure as vice president were found at the Penn Biden Center think tank and Wilmington, Delaware, Pence's team conducted searches of Pence's Indiana home and the office of his political advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his team, Pence informed the National Archives on Jan. 18 that a small number of potential classified documents were found in two small boxes. Another two boxes contained copies of vice presidential papers. The National Archives then informed the FBI, per standard procedure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence attorney Greg Jacob wrote on Jan. 18 to Acting Director Kate Dillon McClure of the White House Liaison Division National Archives and Records Administration to inform her of the papers "containing classified markings."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the documents with classified markings were discovered, they were immediately put into a safe, according to the Pence team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documents were collected by the FBI at Pence's home in Carmel, Indiana, on Thursday evening, Jan. 19. Pence was in Washington, D.C., for the annual March for Life when the FBI collected the documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence's team said that although the documents bear classified markings, the Department of Justice or the agency that issued the documents will need to make a final determination on whether the documents are considered classified or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a letter from Jacob to Chief Operating Officer William Bosanko of the National Archives and Records Administration on Jan. 22, the DOJ departed from its standard procedures that it ran with Biden when it requested direct possession of the documents on Jan. 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other documents that were not identified as potential classified documents were driven from Indiana to the National Archives in Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No classified docs were found at Pence's Advancing American Freedom office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Oversight Committee confirmed to Fox News Digital that Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., was notified by Pence's team Tuesday regarding the discovery of classified documents in his personal residence.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British MPs call for probe into massive spike in deaths</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 3,000 more Britons are dying than average on a weekly basis, and it&rsquo;s not Covid-19 that&rsquo;s responsible</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubled by national statistics showing 20% excess deaths per week, UK MPs have demanded an investigation, the Daily Mail reported on Tuesday. Unlike the last time excess deaths reached such levels, during the second Covid-19 wave, few of these deaths could be attributed to the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking before the House of Commons on Tuesday, Conservative MP Esther McVey skewered Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty for blaming the spike in non-Covid excess deaths on &ldquo;patients not getting statins or blood pressure medicines during the pandemic,&rdquo; pointing out that the monthly figures for statin prescriptions had remained constant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Where is the evidence? And if there isn&rsquo;t one, what is causing these excess deaths?&rdquo; she asked, demanding the minister &ldquo;commit to an urgent and thorough investigation of the matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour shadow public health minister Andrew Gwynne described health secretary Steve Barclay as &ldquo;part man, part ostrich&rdquo; over his refusal to confront the issue, accusing PM Rishi Sunak&rsquo;s government of &ldquo;denial and buck-passing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There were 50,000 more deaths than we would have otherwise expected in 2022,&rdquo; he told the House of Commons on Tuesday. &ldquo;Excluding the pandemic, that&rsquo;s the worst figure since 1951.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Office for National Statistics, 2,837 more people died in the second week of January than normal in England and Wales, with just 5% of those deaths being attributable to Covid-19.e</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time excess deaths were so high, during the second week of February 2021, Covid-19 deaths made up 37% of the total. Nor is the statistic an outlier &ndash; the last two weeks of December saw 21% and 20% excess deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal College of Emergency Medicine reported as many as 500 people a week are dying because they cannot receive emergency treatment in time. A record 54,532 people waited more than 12 hours in emergency departments to actually be admitted to the hospital once the decision was made to admit them, according to NHS data, and only 65% of patients were seen within four hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Whitty warned that &ldquo;postponement of elective and semi-elective care and screening&rdquo; due to lockdowns and NHS delays would result in another wave of mortality after Covid-19 had largely subsided, with undiagnosed cancers and other chronic conditions claiming a larger than usual number of victims.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-democrats-consider-wealth-tax-people-moved-out-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-democrats-consider-wealth-tax-people-moved-out-state</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrats consider wealth tax &mdash; including for people who moved out of state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California lawmakers are pushing legislation that would impose a new tax on the state's wealthiest residents &mdash; even if they've already moved to another part of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblyman Alex Lee, a progressive Democrat, last week introduced a bill in the California State Legislature that would impose an extra annual 1.5% tax on those with a "worldwide net worth" above $1 billion, starting as early as January 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 2026, the threshold for being taxed would drop: those with a worldwide net worth exceeding $50 million would be hit with a 1% annual tax on wealth, while billionaires would still be taxed 1.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide wealth extends beyond annual income to include diverse holdings such as farm assets, arts and other collectibles, and stocks and hedge fund interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is a modified version of a wealth tax approved in the California Assembly in 2020, which the Democrat-led state Senate declined to pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current version just introduced includes measures to allow California to impose wealth taxes on residents even years after they left the state and moved elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exit taxes aren't new in California. But this bill also includes provisions to create contractual claims tied to the assets of a wealthy taxpayer who doesn't have the cash to pay their annual wealth tax bill because most of their assets aren't easily turned into cash. This claim would require the taxpayer to make annual filings with California's Franchise Tax Board and eventually pay the wealth taxes owed, even if they've moved to another state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California was one of several blue states last week to unveil bills to impose new wealth taxes. The other states were Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York and Washington. Each state's proposal contained a different tax approach, but they all centered around the same basic idea: the rich must pay more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. However, he's made public statements echoing the message that wealthier residents should pay higher taxes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The working class has shouldered the tax burden for too long," Lee wrote in a tweet. "The ultra-rich are paying little to nothing by hoarding their wealth through assets. Time to end that."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Lee, the tax would affect 0.1% of California households and generate an additional $21.6 billion in state revenue, which would go to the state general fund. California has among the highest taxes of any state in the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates argue that the money could boost funding for schools, housing and other social programs. Perhaps more importantly, however, Lee hopes it could help address California's massive $22.5 billion budget deficit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is how we can keep addressing our budgetary issues," he told the Los Angeles Times. "Basically, we could plug the entire hole."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, experts counter that the bill will have the exact opposite effect through high administrative costs and by causing an exodus of people to flee the state.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota Legislature Passes Barbaric Bill to Legalize Abortions Up Until Birth</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minnesota state senate passed an abortion rights bill that guarantees a right to an abortion up to the time of birth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill, known as the Protect Reproductive Options (PRO) Act, passed by a vote of 34-33 and now goes to Gov. Bill Walz&rsquo;s desk. He has indicated he will sign it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.F. 1, authored by Sen. Jennifer McEwen, would create a &ldquo;fundamental right&rdquo; to abortion and would allow abortions for any reason, even late in pregnancy. Since a fetus can feel pain as young as 20 weeks into gestation and no later than 28-30 weeks, some states have mandated anesthesia for babies to be aborted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota has no such law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LifeNews:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many amendments that would have made H.F. 1 less extreme were voted down or thwarted. The defeated amendments included ones to protect unborn children in the third trimester (with exceptions), to protect against the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion, to provide the option of anesthesia when unborn children can feel pain, and to protect women&rsquo;s health by requiring that third-trimester abortions take place in a hospital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional abortion-expanding bills have also been introduced at the Capitol. One bill, H.F. 91/S.F. 70, would repeal numerous abortion-related laws, including a law protecting newborns who survive abortion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backers of the bill claim it only legalizes what was already legal and will codify the &ldquo;human right&rdquo; to abortion into law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents disagree, arguing the bill establishes a right to abortion up until the moment of birth. Republicans had attempted to amend the bill with &ldquo;guard rails&rdquo; that would restrict abortions in the third-trimester, but the newly-elected Democratic majority blocked their amendments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Today we are not just codifying Roe v. Wade or Doe v. Gomez, as the author has indicated, we are enacting the most extreme bill in the country,&rdquo; said Republican Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks during debate.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finland Introduces First 'Transgender' Figure Skater, and Things Go Very Badly</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far-left ideology continued to make a mockery of Western civilization over the weekend. Finland, which hosts the European Figure Skating Championships, decided it&rsquo;d be a great idea to hold an opening ceremony that featured a &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; figure skater.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you&rsquo;ll see, things went very badly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1619560033985130496"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1619560033985130496</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you actually watch the video, because the joke here is not just that this man that is pretending to be a woman fell down. It&rsquo;s the entire performance. As the clip rolls, I don&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry because it looks like he&rsquo;s never stepped into an ice rink before. If you strapped skates on some random hobo, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they could do the same job.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone quipped on Twitter in response, it&rsquo;s like watching one of those videos where a football team lets the young kid with cancer score a TD. Except in this case, this isn&rsquo;t a young kid with cancer. It&rsquo;s a full-grown man living out his mental illness for all the world to see. Worse, that mental illness is being affirmed as good and proper by entire nations.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Gates addresses Jeffrey Epstein relationship in awkward interview: 'I had dinner with him and that's all'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft co-founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates continued to downplay his relationship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, claiming for the "100th time" they were merely dinner pals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia&rsquo;s ABC 7.30 host Sarah Ferguson noted during an interview with Gates on Monday "one of the issues that dogged" his relationship to ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, was his ties to Epstein.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LNAwUxZ5nfw"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;WATCH: Bill Gates says meetings with Jeffrey Epstein were 'a mistake'&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/LNAwUxZ5nfw&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">WATCH: Bill Gates says meetings with Jeffrey Epstein were 'a mistake'</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epstein died at age 66 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He was found hanged to death inside a Manhattan federal jail cell on August 10, 2019. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to soliciting a prostitute who was a minor.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixth Memphis police officer involved in Tyre Nichols investigation relieved of duty</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Memphis Police Department has relieved of duty a sixth police officer who was involved in the investigation into Tyre Nichols' death this month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MPD spokesman confirmed the department relieved Officer Preston Hemphill of duty in a Monday statement to Fox News Digital. The 26-year-old officer joined the force in 2018 and allegedly used his taser on Nichols prior to the beating by five other officers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preston, who is white, has not yet been charged with a crime in connection to the incident. Memphis police say he is the subject of an ongoing investigation, however.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five other officers, who are black, include Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr., Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith. They were each terminated on Jan. 18 and are facing seven counts: second-degree murder; aggravated assault, act in concert; two counts of aggravated kidnapping; two counts of official misconduct; and official oppression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials released footage of Nichols' beating on Friday. It shows the five officers punching, kicking, and hitting Nichols with batons as he lies prone on January 7. He died of his injuries in the hospital three days later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to firing the officers, Police Director Cerelyn "CJ" Davis also permanently disbanded the city's so-called Scorpion unit on Saturday. The Unit included the five officers and was focused on preventing and punishing street crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nichols' beating and death has led to outrage acrossthe country, with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) requesting to meet directly with President Biden to discuss police reforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group will meet with the president Wednesday.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-Life activist Mark Houck found NOT GUILTY in Philadelphia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a Philadelphia jury found pro-life activist Mark Houck not guilty of violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Life News, Houck testified during the trial that on October 13, 2021, now-former Planned Parenthood Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center escort Bruce Love chased Houck 100 feet down the sidewalk and across the street to stop Houck from counseling two individuals who had left the planned Parenthood location. The two made contact, with Houck moving Love out of the way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a second incident the same day, Houck and his then-12-year-old son were standing by temselves 50 feet from the clinic entrance and were praying, when Love walked over and stood two feet away from the son and started saying "vile and nasty things."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being told by Houck to stop harassing his son and go away, Love did not, which ended in Houck pushing Love away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charges stemming from the 2021 incident had initially gone through the state court system and was thrown out. The case was picked up by the Biden administration's Department of Justice nearly a year later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On September 23, 2022, Houck's home, where his wife and children were, was swarmed by roughly 15 vehicles and dozens of armed federal SWAT officers. Houck was arrested during the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video evidence shown by the prosecution during the trial reportedly showed Love approaching Houck, who then shoved the 72-year-old back. After the shove, Love fell down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prosecution alleged that the altercation happened after a previous engagement between the two men, but Planned Parenthood did not save any of their camera footage from the day except the excerpt shown.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking outside the courthouse on Monday, Houck thanked those who supported him and his family over the duration of the trial and leading up to it.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Djokovic wins 2023 Australian Open men's singles final with sweep of Tsitsipas, claims 10th title</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serbian superstar Novak Djokovic swept Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 7-6, 7-6 to claim the title in the Australian Open men's singles final on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Djokovic, 35, burst into the major final with a dominating 6-3 win against Greece's Tsitsipas in the opening set. After breaking No. 3 Tsitsipas' serve in the fourth game of set, No. 4 Djokovic jumped to a 3-1 lead and maintained the advantage. The 35-year-old repeated the feat in the third set to take home the victory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunday's match marked the second time Djokovic met Tsitsipas in a major final, both ending in a win for the Serbian player. Tsitsipas claimed two sets against Djokovic in 2019, but ultimately lost the match in five.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the win, Djokovic snags the 10th Australian Open title of his career, which comes a year after he wasn't allowed to compete at Melbourne Park because he wasn't vaccinated for COVID-19. The win also marks his 22nd Grand Slam singles title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the men's record.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the title, Djokovic now moves to the No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-admin-considering-plan-for-annual-covid-boosters?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-admin-considering-plan-for-annual-covid-boosters?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden admin considering plan for annual Covid boosters</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering changing its Covid-19 vaccine strategy in an effort to keep up with an ever-changing virus and eliminate the old "fully vaccinated" model whereby one receives two shots of the original vaccine, followed by regular booster shots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to eliminate the original vaccines and to adopt an approach similar to the flu vaccine, where annually-updated shots are administered that match the strain that is predicted to be the most prevalent, according to a federal official who spoke to NPR under the condition of anonymity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the original approach, where a person must receive the two initial shots of the original vaccine, followed by periodic booster shots, the changes being considered would mean that a person simply receives the latest version of the vaccine in the fall that is tailored to whatever variant of the virus is predicted to be dominant over the winter, much like the formulation and administration of the flu vaccine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response from immunologists and vaccine researchers who spoke to NPR has been mixed, with some arguing that because of such low demand for, and widespread skepticism of, the updated boosters, the public appetite for continued vaccinations makes the new approach not worthwhile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic. "The public is voting with their arms if you will and said, 'No. I'm not going to get this. This doesn't make sense to us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's also a question as to whether the updated bivalent boosters offer any advanced protection compared to the original shots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Moore, an immunologist at Weill Cornell Medical College said, "We have no solid data about the performance of the bivalent boosters. "The hard evidence is lacking, and the evidence that is out there is at the very least inconclusive and to me trends towards saying the bivalent boosters were little if no better."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Paul Offit of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the FDA's advisers, who also questions whether everyone will need boosters or just those at high risk of severe infection. "We shouldn't really be chasing these variants, which are evanescent and are often gone by the time you've created the vaccine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Eric Rubin, a Harvard professor and another member of the FDA's advisory committee, says the administration needs to require more proof that the updated vaccines are actually reducing the risk of getting infected, getting sick, hospitalized and dying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA's potential plan acknowledges that the world might finally be settling into a more predictable co-existence with the virus, in much the same way we live with the flu and cold viruses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet on Thursday to discuss the future of the Covid-19 vaccine and to vote on any potential changes.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamala Harris omits Americans' right to 'life' from Declaration of Independence during abortion speech</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, Kamala Harris gave a speech in Tallahassee, Florida over abortion where she quoted the Declaration of Independence but left out the part of the document that said Americans have a right to life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3jOEg7gXLU&amp;t=7s"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;VIRAL MOMENT: Kamala Harris Leaves Out Right To Life In Quote Of Declaration During Abortion Speech&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3jOEg7gXLU&amp;t=7s&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">VIRAL MOMENT: Kamala Harris Leaves Out Right To Life In Quote Of Declaration During Abortion Speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play 0:00-1:06</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;. I won&rsquo;t&hellip; make you&hellip; listen&hellip;. To that&hellip; whole&hellip; speech!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those keeping score at home, The Declaration of Independence reads, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris did not mention the right to life as written in the Declaration throughout her 18-minute long speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, Harris arrived in Florida on Thursday and announced that the Biden administration planned to further extend ways to provide abortion pills to those who seek them. She also criticized Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for his pro-life views.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her speech comes on the 50 year anniversary of the now repealed Row v. Wade Supreme Court decision..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 24, in a 6-3 decision stemming from the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization the Supreme Court ruled that "The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://redstate.com/kiradavis/2023/01/22/los-angeles-rams-tells-fans-to-donate-to-democrat-anti-gun-group-following-mass-shooting-n692581"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://redstate.com/kiradavis/2023/01/22/los-angeles-rams-tells-fans-to-donate-to-democrat-anti-gun-group-following-mass-shooting-n692581</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Rams Tells Fans to Donate to Democrat Anti-Gun Group Following Mass Shooting</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tragic and reprehensible mass shooting on Saturday night, in the Los Angeles County city of Monterey Park, has prompted expressions of concern and condolences from across California and the nation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those offering condolences is the Los Angeles Rams football team. The organization took to social media to offer solidarity with the Monterey Park community and all those celebrating the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is the celebration that was happening when the violence unfolded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sentiment should have been (and is) enough (even with the gun violence bit thrown in for good measure), but in California, there is no such thing as &ldquo;too far.&rdquo; The Rams decided to push it a step further and promote the anti-second amendment group Everytown for Gun Safety, as if guns are Los Angeles&rsquo; problem, not unchecked criminal behavior and soft-on-crime policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown for Gun Safety is an anti-second amendment activist group founded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who was also the mayor of one of the most violent cities in America. It is also a Democrat political organization, having pledged over $60 million dollars to Democrat candidates in the 2020 election season. They continue to work to influence elections and elected officials toward their anti-second amendment agenda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is all well and good. They are not secretive about their mission, nor should they be. Certainly there are plenty of people within the Los Angeles Rams organization who align with Everytown&rsquo;s values, and many fans as well. To be sure, there are also plenty of employees and fans who value their second amendment rights, and find activist groups like Bloomberg&rsquo;s quite objectionable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paired with the fact that the city of Los Angeles has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, and simultaneously some of the highest gun crime rates in the nation, it only seems like common sense that a football team might want to hold off on politicizing a tragic event and then using it to fundraise for a politically partisan group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a myriad of charities the Rams organization could have encouraged Americans to donate towards, ones that don&rsquo;t actively campaign for one political party or another. In this case it is the very political party who&rsquo;s policies and &ldquo;defund the police&rdquo; platforms have led to this rash of crime plaguing innocent Americans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Los Angeles Rams join many other professional sports teams who seem to be actively trying to repulse their most loyal fans.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle running out of dead body storage due to fentanyl ODs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle&rsquo;s fentanyl overdose crisis is so bad that the King County Medical Examiner is running low on storage for dead bodies. The stunning admission was made by Seattle-King County Public Health Director Dr. Faisal Khan during a recent Board of Health meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Medical Examiner&rsquo;s Office is now struggling with the issue of storing bodies because the fentanyl-related death toll continues to climb. Obviously, they have finite space in the coolers they use and that space is now being exceeded on a regular basis,&rdquo; Dr. Khan admitted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King County has already experienced over one fatal fentanyl overdose death a day for the month of January, with 31 deaths as of Jan. 22, 2023. Last year, the county recorded 1,019 fatal overdoses, with fentanyl responsible for the majority of deaths at 686. It&rsquo;s the highest number of overdose deaths the county has ever recorded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug overdoses are straining the Medical Examiner&rsquo;s resources, forcing the county to adapt to the rise in deaths. Not only are these deaths on top of every other death handled by the county, but the area&rsquo;s population has also been growing.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Supreme Court Report Fails to Identify Leaker of Roe v. Wade Draft Opinion</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court released a report stating that, after a months-long internal investigation, the leaker of a draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade last year couldn&rsquo;t be identified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leak shattered the image of the Supreme Court, which has long prided itself on maintaining proper decorum and on keeping as confidential the deliberations of the justices in cases argued before the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day after the leak, Chief Justice John Roberts said there would be an investigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite his assurances, the unprecedented leak reportedly caused internal disruptions at the court and changed the atmosphere behind-the-scenes while giving rise to rampant speculation about the motives of the leaker or leakers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some said the leak was intended to generate a public backlash that would intimidate the conservative justices into leaving Roe intact, while others speculated that it was calculated to pressure the conservative justices, who had already signaled a willingness to reverse Roe, to stay the course and actually do it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court justices, including Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote both the draft and published versions of the opinion, previously described the leak of the document as a &ldquo;grave betrayal.&rdquo; In recent months, various justices said an update on the progress of the investigation was coming, but no updates followed until the formal release of the report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leak was followed by months of raucous protests at the homes of the conservative justices in Maryland and Virginia, targeted harassment of justices in public by left-wing activists, and angry words in Congress. One man was arrested and charged with plotting to kill Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report (pdf) on Supreme Court Marshal Gail Curley&rsquo;s investigation was issued midday on Jan. 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court ruled on June 24, 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization that there&rsquo;s no constitutional right to abortion, overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 precedent that legalized abortion nationwide. The Dobbs ruling returned the regulation of abortion to the states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five conservative justices voted to reverse Roe. Roberts, also considered a conservative, voted to uphold the restrictive Mississippi abortion law in question but wrote that he wouldn&rsquo;t have overturned Roe. Three liberal justices issued a strongly worded joint dissent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, an early version of the draft majority opinion in Dobbs made its way to the media, a first-of-its-kind leak of a full high court opinion. Politico published the draft document, dated Feb. 10, 2022, on May 2, 2022, without disclosing its source. In the end, the draft document wasn&rsquo;t much different than the official published opinion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation itself is continuing, according to the report.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump 'probably coming back to Twitter'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump is looking to return to Twitter and Facebook. Trump, whose account was reinstated following the purchasing of Twitter by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, has stuck to his own platform, Truth Social, despite his account's unsuspended status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Republican with knowledge of private discussions on Trump's potential return to Twitter, who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity, said, "Trump is probably coming back to Twitter. It&rsquo;s just a question of how and when. He&rsquo;s been talking about it for weeks, but Trump speaks for Trump, so it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess what he&rsquo;ll do or say or when."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another person close to Trump told the outlet that Trump has sought input on his potential return to Twitter for weeks, and that his campaign advisors have been workshopping ideas for his first Tweet on the platform in over 2 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Trump advisors said that the 2024 presidential hopeful could be limited in posting to other social media platforms since he founded Truth Social. A spokesman for Trump told NBC though that the campaign believes he would be able to return to Twitter as before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump was banished from the popular social media platform on January 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol riot on January 6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump previously said that he would not be returning to the platform and that he would stick to Truth Social.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Truth Social is through the roof," he said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talks of Trump's potential return to Twitter comes as Trump's campaign has petitioned for his Facebook account to be reinstated, as the account nears the end of it's two-year suspension. The Facebook ban, enacted on January 7, 2021, was for an initial period of two years, after which it would come up for review.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-alec-baldwin-to-be-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-fatal-rust-shooting?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-alec-baldwin-to-be-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-fatal-rust-shooting?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alec Baldwin to be charged with involuntary manslaughter in fatal Rust shooting</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, prosecutors announced that they will charge Alec Baldwin and armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed with two counts each of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on Baldwin&rsquo;s Rust set.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of the charge comes over two years after Alec Baldwin shot and killed 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza with a live round from a prop gun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CBS News National Correspondent Kris Van Cleve, Assistant Director David Hall "has signed a plea agreement for the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon. The terms include a suspended sentence and six months probation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No charges were filed in connection to the shooting of Rust director Joel Souza, who was injured but survived.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement from New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, she stated that her office will file criminal charges against the two by the end of the month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involuntary manslaughter is a fourth-degree felony in the state of New Mexico, and carries an 18-month jail sentence and a $5,000 fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carmack-Altwies noted that "The other charge is involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a lawful act," which is also a fourth-degree felony carrying the same sentencing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Baldwin had said in an interview with George Stephanopolous that he "didn&rsquo;t pull the trigger," but a later FBI analysis concluded that he did in fact pull the trigger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was found that the prop gun had been loaded with live rounds, and that the gun had misfired multiple times leading up to the fatal shooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April of 2022, New Mexico&rsquo;s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau fined Rust Movie Productions $136,793, the maximum possible fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bureau also reportedly issued a "scathing narrative of safety failures in violation of standard industry protocols," which included testimony that the production&rsquo;s managers took little to no action to address two previous misfires leading up to the fatal October shooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also documented numerous gun safety complaints brought forth by crew members that they say went unnoticed, and said that weapons specialists were not allowed to make decisions regarding additional safety training.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production&rsquo;s head armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, had previously had a number of complaints lodged against her in regard to concerns over her careless handling of weapons. Gutierrez-Reed and her assistants had also been allegedly been playing with weapons on the set of Rust. Hutchins had reportedly been advocating for safer conditions for her team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November of 2022, Baldwin launched a lawsuit against several crew members of the film for reckless and dereliction of duty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit named Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the chief armorer, Assistant Director Dave Halls, Prop Master Sarah Zachry and Seth Kenney, the gun supplier.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous month, Baldwin settled with Hutchins&rsquo; family in a wrongful death suit. As part of the agreement, Matthew Hutchins, Halyna&rsquo;s widower, will act as an executive producer when the film resumes production.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2022, it was revealed that Rust would resume production in January, but the production would not resume in New Mexico, according to Variety.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sister Andr&eacute;, world's oldest person, dies at age 118</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucile Randon, the French nun who was the world's oldest living person and the oldest person to survive COVID-19, died in her sleep on Tuesday, Jan. 17, at the Sainte-Catherine-Laboure nursing home in the town of Toulon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randon was less than a month away from celebrating her 119th birthday, multiple outlets reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born on Feb. 11, 1904, Randon worked as a teacher, governess and child care provider before becoming a Catholic nun in 1944.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After becoming a nun, Randon took the name "Sr. Andr&eacute;."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randon was declared to be the "oldest person living (female)" and "overall oldest person living" following the death of 119-year-old Kane Tanaka of Japan on April 19, 2022, according to Guinness World Records.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her life, Randon spent nearly 30 years working with orphans and the elderly at a hospital in Vichy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randon told Guinness World Records that she enjoyed eating chocolate and other sweets as a "guilty pleasure" and had a glass of wine each day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also credited her long life to hard work, telling French media in 2022 that she worked until she was 108 years old.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randon was what's known as a "supercentenarian" &mdash; someone who lives over the age of 110.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world's eight verified oldest living people are all women, according to the Gerontology Research Group's website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four of the top eight were born in Japan, three were born in the United States, one was born in France and one was born in Brazil.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft, Amazon and other tech companies have laid off more than 60,000 employees in the last year</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The job cuts in tech land are piling up, as companies that led the 10-year bull market adapt to a new reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft said Wednesday that it&rsquo;s letting go of 10,000 employees, which will reduce the company&rsquo;s headcount by less than 5%. Amazon</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;also began a fresh round of job cuts that are expected to eliminate more than 18,000 employees and become the largest workforce reduction in the e-retailer&rsquo;s 28-year history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The layoffs come in a period of slowing growth, higher interest rates to battle inflation, and fears of a possible recession next year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the major cuts in the tech industry so far. All numbers are approximations based on filings, public statements and media reports:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft: 10,000 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft is reducing 10,000 workers through March 31 as the software maker braces for slower revenue growth. The company also is taking a $1.2 billion charge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive,&rdquo; CEO Satya Nadella announced in a memo to employees that was posted on the company website Wednesday. Some employees will find out this week if they&rsquo;re losing their jobs, he wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon: 18,000 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Amazon</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;CEO Andy Jassy said the company was planning to lay off more than 18,000 employees, primarily in its human resources and stores divisions. It came after Amazon said in November it was looking to cut staff, including in its devices and recruiting organizations. CNBC reported at the time that the company was looking to lay off about 10,000 employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company&rsquo;s global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce: 7,000 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce is cutting 10% of its personnel and reducing some office space as part of a restructuring plan, the company announced Jan. 4. It employed more than 79,000 workers as of December.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to employees, co-CEO Marc Benioff said customers have been more &ldquo;measured&rdquo; in their purchasing decisions given the challenging macroeconomic environment, which led Salesforce to make the &ldquo;very difficult decision&rdquo; to lay off workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce said it will record charges of $1 billion to $1.4 billion related to the headcount reductions, and $450 million to $650 million related to the office space reductions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta: 11,000 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook parent Meta</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;announced its most significant round of layoffs ever in November. The company said it plans to eliminate 13% of its staff, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s disappointing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022 wiped out one-fourth of the company&rsquo;s market cap and pushed the stock to its lowest level since 2016.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech giant&rsquo;s cuts come after it expanded headcount by about 60% during the pandemic. The business has been hurt by competition from rivals such as TikTok, a broad slowdown in online ad spending and challenges from Apple&rsquo;s iOS changes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter: 3,700 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after closing his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in late October, new owner Elon Musk cut around 3,700 Twitter employees, according to internal communications viewed by CNBC. That&rsquo;s about half the staff. Since then, significantly more employees have quit after Musk changed some policies around working from home and wrote that he expected all employees to commit to a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; work environment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet on Nov. 4, Musk said there was &ldquo;no choice&rdquo; but to lay off employees as the company was losing $4 million per day.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia Flyers&rsquo; Ivan Provorov Stands By His Faith, Refuses To Wear LGBTQ+ Pride Night Jersey</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent match between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Anaheim Ducks, one member of the Flyers did not wear the Pride Night themed rainbow warmup jersey meant to show support for the LGBTQ+ movement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensemen Ivan Provorov, a religious Christian and part of the Russian Orthodox Church, abstained from taking part in the compulsory-endorsement of beliefs that go against his faith. For his refusal, the Flyers put out a politically correct response before the online mob descended on them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reports of Provorov&rsquo;s refusal to wear the Pride Night jersey were confirmed by head coach John Tortorella, who unlike the statement released by the unnamed team spokesperson, praised the player for standing by his faith instead of throwing him under the bus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provorov did speak with the media where he affirmed his position not to take part in the LGBTQ+ propaganda.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/holiday-2022-sales-fall-short-of-expectations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/holiday-2022-sales-fall-short-of-expectations.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday sales fall short of expectations, set stage for tougher 2023 for retailers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday sales came in below industry expectations, as shoppers felt pinched by inflation and rising interest rates, according to data from the National Retail Federation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales during November and December grew 5.3% year over year to $936.3 billion, below the major trade group&rsquo;s prediction for growth of between 6% and 8% over the year prior. In early November, NRF had projected spending of between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retail sales number excludes spending at automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants, and is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. It covers the period from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holiday sales gains include the impact of inflation, which drives up total sales. The consumer price index, which measures the cost of a broad mix of goods and services, was up 6.5% in December compared with a year ago, according to the Labor Department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For retailers, the shopping season&rsquo;s results reflect the challenges ahead. As Americans continue to pay higher prices for groceries, housing and more month after month, they are racking up credit card balances, spending down savings and having fewer dollars for discretionary spending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, retailers are following years of extraordinary spending. During the Covid pandemic, Americans fought boredom and used stimulus checks by buying loungewear, throw pillows, kitchen supplies, home theater systems and more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That translated to sharp year-over-year jumps in retail sales in the past two holiday seasons &mdash; a 14.1% gain in 2021 and 8.3% gain in 2020. On average, holidays sales have grown by 4.9% annually over the past decade, according to NRF.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NRF Chief Executive Matt Shay said those upward leaps were unsustainable, especially as people return to commuting, going out to dinner and booking vacations again. Plus, he said, Americans are paying higher prices across the board, from pricier rents to more expensive groceries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales rose in most major retail categories during the holiday season. Online and nonstore sales saw the biggest year-over-year gains, jumping 9.5% during the holiday season. Sales at grocery and beverage stores, which have had significant price increases, rose 7.8% versus the year-ago period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand in some categories noticeably weakened. Sales at furniture and home furnishings stores declined 1.1% and sales at electronics and appliances stores dropped 5.7% year over year.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate Group Turns on World Economic Forum after Hundreds of Private Jets Fly into Davos</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenpeace torched the World Economic Forum attendees for traveling to Davos, Switzerland, in a scathing rebuke of the Klaus Schwab run event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a newly released analysis commissioned by Greenpeace found, approximately 1,040 private jets flew in and out of airports servicing Davos during last year&rsquo;s World Economic Forum conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those jets, most were embarking on short-haul flights of less than 500 miles that &ldquo;could have easily been train or car trips.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One plane carried its passengers a mere 13 miles to attend the event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis, conducted by Dutch environmental consulting firm CE Delft, also revealed that the number of arrivals and departures out of Davos airports included neighboring countries such as Germany, France, and Italy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research concluded that private jet travel in the WEF &ldquo;Great Reset&rsquo; event in 2021 produced carbon emissions equivalent to those caused in one week by 350,000 cars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private jet emissions linked to Davos quadrupled during the week of the event compared to weeks before and after the meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WEF&rsquo;s theme for 2023 is &ldquo;Cooperation in a Fragmented World,&rdquo; which involves &ldquo;how we can tackle the numerous and interlinked challenges the world is facing and find solutions through public-private cooperation,&rdquo; the organization&rsquo;s press release said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klaus Schwab said in his opening remarks that &ldquo;investing into a greener and therefore more sustainable economy&rdquo; is one of the main objectives of the conference attendees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also confirmed during her remarks that policymakers would endeavor to &ldquo;reach net zero&rdquo; carbon emissions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Member states of the European Union which rely on fossil fuel production to combat climate change, were forced to scramble for new power supplies after the Nord Stream pipeline attack and Russia&rsquo;s severing reserves.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of the World Economic Forum</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WEF 'Danger of Disinformation' Panel: Hate Speech Laws Coming to the US</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One participant in the World Economic Forum's panel on "The Clear and Present Danger of Disinformation" at their annual meeting in Davos on Tuesday had a chilling prediction for hate speech laws in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel, hosted by former CNN host Brian Stelter, also featured Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) and Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission Vice President for Values and Transparency Věra Jourov&aacute;, who is from the Czech Republic, said there are reasons why many parts in Europe have strong speech code laws and the United States could soon have them too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Illegal hate speech, which you will have soon also in the U.S., I think that we have a strong reason why we have this in the criminal law," Jourov&aacute; said. "We need to the platforms to simply work with the language and to identify such cases."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sulzberger said overall disinformation is "the most existential" challenge and whatever problems with reporting stories inaccurately, the New York Times has made corrections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2023/01/17/taliban-reportedly-buying-blue-checks-on-twitter-n524292"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2023/01/17/taliban-reportedly-buying-blue-checks-on-twitter-n524292</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taliban reportedly buying blue checks on Twitter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought things on Twitter were getting a bit weird since Elon Musk took over, buckle up. The strangeness continues this week. There has been quite a debate taking place over Musk&rsquo;s decision to revamp the &ldquo;verification&rdquo; system and sell checkmarks of various colors to anyone who requests one and is willing to fork over a small monthly payment. Plenty of people have been taking advantage of that offer, gaining some amplification of their tweets and other user options not available to the hoi polloi. So perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t have been all that surprised to learn that high-ranking officials from the Taliban have gotten in on the action, but it still certainly sounds disturbing at first glance. (BBC)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taliban have started using Twitter&rsquo;s paid-for verification feature, meaning some now have blue ticks on their accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the blue tick indicated &ldquo;active, notable, and authentic accounts of public interest&rdquo; verified by Twitter, and could not be purchased. But now, users can buy them through the new Twitter Blue service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least two Taliban officials and four prominent supporters in Afghanistan are currently using the checkmarks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the terrorist officials who now has a blue check is Hedayatullah Hedayat, the head of the Taliban&rsquo;s department for &ldquo;access to information.&rdquo; He is definitely on Twitter with more than 180,000 followers and he tweets regularly. But I don&rsquo;t see a checkmark of any color by his name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over to China&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/chinas-first-population-drop-in-six-decades-sounds-alarm-on-demographic-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/chinas-first-population-drop-in-six-decades-sounds-alarm-on-demographic-crisis</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s population fell last year for the first time in six decades, a historic turn that is expected to mark the start of a long period of decline in its citizen numbers with profound implications for its economy and the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country&rsquo;s National Bureau of Statistics reported a drop of roughly 850,000 people for a population of 1.41175 billion in 2022, marking the first decline since 1961, the last year of China&rsquo;s Great Famine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That possibly makes India the world&rsquo;s most populous nation. U.N. experts predicted last year India would have a population of 1.412 billion in 2022 though they did not expect the South Asian nation to overtake China until this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India, however, only collects population figures every 10 years and its latest census, originally scheduled for 2021, has been delayed due to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term, U.N. experts see China&rsquo;s population shrinking by 109 million by 2050, more than triple the decline of their previous forecast in 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s caused domestic demographers to lament that China will get old before it gets rich, slowing the economy as revenues drop and government debt increases due to soaring health and welfare costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the country&rsquo;s shrinking labor force and downturn in manufacturing heft would further exacerbate high prices and high inflation in the United States and Europe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s birth rate last year was just 6.77 births per 1,000 people, down from a rate of 7.52 births in 2021 and marking the lowest birth rate on record.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of Chinese women of childbearing age, which the government defines as aged 25 to 35, fell by about 4 million, Kang said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death rate, the highest since 1974 during the Cultural Revolution, was 7.37 deaths per 1,000 people, which compares with a rate of 7.18 deaths in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the demographic downturn is the result of China&rsquo;s one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015 as well as sky-high education costs that have put many Chinese off having more than one child or even having any at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-child policy and a traditional preference for boys have also created a deep gender imbalance. The latest data shows China with around 722 million males compared to 690 million females. The imbalance, which is more pronounced in rural areas, has led to fewer families being formed in recent years.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrest of 'last godfather' deals new blow to ailing Sicilian mafia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ROME &mdash; The arrest of Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro deals a powerful blow to the mythology of the Cosa Nostra, toppling a symbol of the group&rsquo;s resistance to police efforts to break up organized crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messina Denaro, 60, was Italy&rsquo;s most wanted mafia boss and had been on the run for three decades. He had been sentenced in absentia to a life term for his role in the 1992 murders of anti-mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His arrest comes almost 30 years to the day after police caught Salvatore &ldquo;Toto&rdquo; Riina, Cosa Nostra&rsquo;s biggest figure of the 20th century, and marks the last step in efforts to dismantle the group&rsquo;s historical clan leadership.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts describe Cosa Nostra, its fame amplified by movies such as &ldquo;The Godfather,&rdquo; as an ailing crime group facing several difficulties, including competition in the highly lucrative drugs market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Cosa Nostra retains control of its Sicilian territory and a capacity to infiltrate the broader economy, it has been supplanted by groups such as the Calabrian &lsquo;Ndrangheta in the drugs trade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sergi said it was not clear who would step in to replace Messina Denaro in what is now a more factionalised mafia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/biden-administration-urges-judges-to-lift-stay-on-cdcs-airplane-mask-mandate_4990674.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/biden-administration-urges-judges-to-lift-stay-on-cdcs-airplane-mask-mandate_4990674.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration in a court hearing on Jan. 17 urged judges on a federal appeals court to overturn a ruling from a lower court that struck down the administration&rsquo;s airplane mask mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; to impose the mandate and bypass the notice- and comment period required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Brian Springer, an attorney for the government, told judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time the mandate was imposed, in early 2021, &ldquo;there were variants that had just been detected that showed signs of increased transmissibility, and people were starting to travel again,&rdquo; Springer said. &ldquo;In those circumstances, the CDC had good cause to issue this order, particularly when the CDC detailed the reasons why in this particular environment, namely in the transportation sector and in transportation settings, COVID had a specific tendency to spread among people who are traveling together because they&rsquo;re standing together in lines and sitting together on conveyances.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the judges expressed skepticism with the line of thinking, accusing the CDC of issuing &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; language to impose the mandate without a notice and comment period. Under a ruling in a separate case, boilerplate statements that COVID-19 exists and that there&rsquo;s a public emergency aren&rsquo;t sufficient to satisfy the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; exception to the APA. Springer disagreed, saying the CDC&rsquo;s statement provided rationale that met the standard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, a Trump appointee, said in her 2022 ruling that the CDC violated the APA by only issuing a single conclusory sentence to support ducking the notice requirements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted that at the time the order was issued, around a year had passed since the beginning of the pandemic, and COVID-19 cases in America were on the decline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brent Hardaway, arguing for Health Freedom Defense Fund, which brought the case, said that the mandate was &ldquo;very strange&rdquo; given that airplanes and many airports already had mandates in place, in addition to the decline in cases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other portions of the hearing went over arguments as to whether the CDC has the authority to mandate masks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. code gives the federal government the power to enforce regulations judged as &ldquo;necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government, to enforce such measures, &ldquo;may provide for such inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, destruction of animals or articles found to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous infection to human beings, and other measures, as in his judgment may be necessary,&rdquo; the statute says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In striking down the CDC&rsquo;s moratorium on evictions, the Supreme Court found that the agency overstepped the authority outlined in the law. But the court also said the law empowered the CDC to impose measures that &ldquo;directly relate to preventing the interstate spread of disease by identifying, isolating, and destroying the disease itself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/study-finds-journalists-are-now-among-the-most-distrusted-groups-in-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/study-finds-journalists-are-now-among-the-most-distrusted-groups-in-the-world/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study Finds Journalists Are Now among the Most Distrusted Groups in the World</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Edelman Trust Barometer, more than two-thirds of respondents worried that journalists and reporters are &ldquo;purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the groups presented, the percentage of journalists is the highest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings also show that the percentage is the highest among the groups presented, with one percentage point above government leaders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newest finding is eight points higher than last year, proving that people are rapidly losing trust in the media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when the question was phrased differently, journalists fared slightly better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the groups presented, Government leaders ranked the lowest at 42%, with journalists coming in second with 46%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most trusted groups were scientists and fellow coworkers, at 75% and 74%, respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new findings reflect the gorwing lack of trust in media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those surveyed, 46% said media divided society, compared to just 35% who said media are a unifying force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also concerns about the weaponization of fake news, with over three-quarters of respondents saying they were concerned about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Ronald Reagan extolled the central role of the media in American democracy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Since the founding of this nation, freedom of the press has been a fundamental tenet of American life,&rdquo; Reagan said on Oct. 6, 1983.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There is no more essential ingredient than a free, strong, and independent press to our continued success in what the Founding Fathers called our &lsquo;noble experiment&rsquo; in self-government.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the media has changed a lot since then, becoming an entity that is no different from a Government lobbyist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/illinois-counties-not-enforce-assault-weapon-ban"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/illinois-counties-not-enforce-assault-weapon-ban</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 70 Illinois counties say they will not enforce state 'assault weapon' ban: Report</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois sheriffs of almost 80 counties are refusing to enforce the state's " assault weapons " ban that was recently signed into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker .</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pritzker signed the Protect Illinois Communities Act into law on Jan. 10, which bans the distribution and sale of "assault weapons," high-capacity magazines, and switches in Illinois. Those who own such guns are expected to register them with Illinois State Police by Jan. 1, 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, at least 74 sheriff's departments have publicly stated they will not enforce the ban, stating it infringes on the Second Amendment, according to ABC News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards County Sheriff Darby Boewe wrote in a statement that part of his duty is to protect the right to keep and bear arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The right to keep and bear arms for defense of life, liberty, and property is regarded as an inalienable right by the people," Boewe wrote. "Therefore, as the custodian of the jail and chief law enforcement officer for Edwards County, that neither myself or my office will be checking to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the State, nor will we be arresting or housing individuals that have been charged solely with noncompliance of this act."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement was drafted by Illinois Sheriffs' Association Executive Director Jim Kaitschuk, according to ABC News, and sent out to sheriff's departments to use or make edits if desired.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DuPage, Sangamon, and Iroquois counties are among the 74 departments that have released similarly modified statements. Iroquois County Sheriff Clinton Perzee said he would not use his jails to detain people exercising their civil rights, according to the Lake and McHenry County Scanner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an event in Quincy on Jan. 12, Pritzker told the crowd that law enforcement needs to enforce the law or leave the field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several counties have reportedly designated themselves "Second Amendment sanctuary cities," something that Pritzker dismissed at the Quincy event.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Good Things Will Happen&rsquo;: Brendan Fraser Chokes Up After Critic&rsquo;s Choice Win</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the peak of his success, being one of the highest-paid actors of the time for blockbusters like The Mummy, George of the Jungle and Bedazzled, Fraser completely disappeared from the movie scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the movie was all action-packed fun with Fraser portraying the tough and oh so handsome Rick O&rsquo;Connell, the actor suffered several major injuries during the shooting of the three films. During the filming of The Mummy in 1999, Fraser was almost choked to death during his hanging scene in the opening of the movie, as per The Things. His co-star Rachel Weisz recalled that he stopped breathing and even needed CPR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was just one mishap. The injuries he received from the ancient Egyptian-themed films led to multiple surgeries including a laminectomy, a back procedure to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves; a partial knee replacement; more back surgeries to bolt compressed spinal pads together; vocal cord repair and other procedures, as per People magazine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as his professional life took a hit, his private life also resulted in a blow when his ex-wife, Afton Smith, split from him in 2007. Fraser was then required to pay around US$900,000 for child support, as per the New York Post. Six years after the divorce, Fraser allegedly asked the court to reduce the payment as he said he was no longer able to afford the hefty sum due to lack of work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward to today&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraser broke down in tears during his acceptance speech during Sunday evening&rsquo;s Critic&rsquo;s Choice Awards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraser was nominated for his performance as Charlie &mdash; a morbidly obese teacher who was attempting to repair his damaged relationship with his daughter (played by Sadie Sink) while eating himself to death &mdash; in &ldquo;The Whale,&rdquo; and he took home the Best Actor prize.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraser was clearly already emotional when his name was announced, and everyone at his table got to their feet and cheered. The applause continued as he made his way to the stage, stopping only to offer hugs and handshakes to a few people along the way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Fraser took the stage, it was clear that he was not going to make it through the speech without his emotions getting the best of him.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/new-guidelines-recommend-drugs-surgery-for-12-year-olds-to-tackle-obesity-early?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/new-guidelines-recommend-drugs-surgery-for-12-year-olds-to-tackle-obesity-early?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New guidelines from American Academy of Pediatrics suggest treating childhood obesity with drugs, surgery</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medications and surgery are being recommended for children as young as 12 in order to fight off obesity "early and aggressively," according to new guidelines released Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the practice of "watchful waiting" was applied to see if a child would grow out of their obesity but "Waiting doesn&rsquo;t work," according to Dr. Ihuoma Eneli, who co-authored the first guidance on childhood obesity in 15 years from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Associated Press reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What we see is a continuation of weight gain and the likelihood that they'll have (obesity) in adulthood," Eneli continued. Eneli is the director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children&rsquo;s Hospital located in Columbus, Ohio. According to the Columbus Dispatch, Columbus' Childrens Hospital has spent 3.3 billion in recent additions to its complex.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance contains specific diets, exercises and other behavior and lifestyle interventions, as well as specific ages at which specific treatments can and should be offered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medications for kids as young as 12 and surgery for kids as young as 13 are now the recommendations in order to stave off the worsening obesity problem that affects more than 14.4 million young people in the US and is responsible for myriad health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is for the new guidelines to change the way that obesity is viewed, so that its not just seen as "a personal problem, maybe a failure of the person's diligence," said Dr. Sandra Hassink, another co-author of the guidance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is not different than you have asthma and now we have an inhaler for you," she added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines also take into account that obesity is often affected by biological factors, and that it's not just a lifestyle problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obesity affects close to 20 percent of US children and teens, and around 42 percent of adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new guidelines come at the same time as a new obesity drug for children is approved for use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegovy, a weekly injection for use in children ages 12 and older, has been shown in trials to be efficient for teenages, reducing their BMI by around 16 percent on average. The drug affects the communication between the brain and the stomach, enabling the user to feel more full than they otherwise would be.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2023/01/15/how-badly-did-we-overcount-covid-deaths-and-hospitalizations-n523940"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2023/01/15/how-badly-did-we-overcount-covid-deaths-and-hospitalizations-n523940</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How badly did we overcount COVID deaths and hospitalizations?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;re still only on the first steps of the road to learning how badly the COVID pandemic was handled by the government, the media, and, well&hellip; pretty much everyone. But the veil is slowly being lifted regarding some of the unforced errors that were made. Even the legacy media is starting to admit that a serious math error took place alongside the many other errors being discovered. Specifically, the total count of COVID hospitalizations and deaths being reported was obviously far higher than it should have been. At Townhall, our colleague Sarah Arnold reports that a CNN medical specialist and Washington Post columnist has been allowed to speak the truth. Many of the people hospitalized &ldquo;for COVID&rdquo; sought medical care for entirely different reasons, and many of the dead did not actually die from COVID or anything related to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly two years after the Covid-19 pandemic, CNN medical analyst and Washington Post columnist Dr. Lena Wen admitted that hospitals were exaggerating the number of deaths they claimed was from Covid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titled, &ldquo;We Are Over-Counting COVID Deaths and Hospitalizations. That&rsquo;s a Problem,&rdquo; Wren acknowledged that &ldquo;90 percent of patients diagnosed with COVID are actually in the hospital for some other illness.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Since every hospitalized patient gets tested for covid, many are incidentally positive,&rdquo; Wren wrote, citing Robin Dretler, an attending physician at Emory Decatur Hospital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sarah points out, while this admission may be a welcome step toward setting the record straight, it&rsquo;s coming out two years too late. Those death and hospitalization figures were used to justify all manner of government overreach and oppression. Learning these facts now will not do anything to change the past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how could the math possibly have been so wrong? That&rsquo;s easy enough to explain. Every patient or body showing up at a hospital or a morgue was tested for COVID. If the test came back positive, that person was added to the count. So a nearly asymptomatic person who was hit by a car and died was added to the death toll. A patient admitted to the hospital with a knife wound to the stomach who tested positive was listed as another &ldquo;COVID hospitalization.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s not as if at least some of us didn&rsquo;t already know this. There were people, including leading doctors and virologists, who were talking about this all through 2021. Or at least they were trying to talk about it. You didn&rsquo;t hear a peep about this on MSNBC or CNN unless it was a segment calling out &ldquo;misinformation.&rdquo; Dr. Robert Malone, an actual mRNA vaccine research scientist, was banned from Twitter for trying to bring up this issue. (He was reinstated after Musk took over.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that we&rsquo;re talking about the period in 2021 when the virus was still running wild. Pandemic porn was at a premium on cable news outlets and in the larger newspapers. Andrew Cuomo was still giving his Emmy-winning (later rescinded) daily pandemic updates and being touted as the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;shadow president.&rdquo; CNN kept a running count of the deaths and hospitalizations in the upper right corner of the screen 24/7 no matter what story they were currently covering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are going to be a lot of people with much to answer for when all of this is said and done. Will any of them be held accountable? Don&rsquo;t hold your breath. (And if you do hold your breath for too long, you&rsquo;ll probably be taken to the emergency room and counted as another &ldquo;COVID hospitalization.&rdquo;)</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Country&rsquo;s Biggest School Districts Are Explicitly Hiding Kids&rsquo; Gender Transitions From Parents</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nation&rsquo;s largest school districts are implementing policies that require educators to keep students&rsquo; gender transitions a secret from their parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Unified School District, Chicago Public Schools and New York Public Schools are promoting practices and policies that hide a student&rsquo;s transgender status from their parents. The policies have become a cultural flashpoint amid a battle over the role parents should play in their child&rsquo;s education, and the extent to which gender ideology has infiltrated K-12 classrooms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest school district in the nation with 565,000 students, has a &ldquo;Gender Identity and Students &ndash; Ensuring Equity and Nondiscrimination&rdquo; policy that tells educators to be mindful that a student may have not told their parents about their change in gender identity and be careful not to reveal the child&rsquo;s gender status. Educators are advised to not reveal a student&rsquo;s gender identity unless the student wants because the parent may not be &ldquo;supportive of the student.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Public Schools, which enrolls about 340,000 students, has a &ldquo;guidelines regarding the support of transgender and gender nonconforming students&rdquo; which requires a &ldquo;student administrative support team&rdquo; to coordinate action and support for transgender and gender nonconforming students. Parents are not required to be notified or involved in the process of the child&rsquo;s transition at school, the guidelines stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York City Department of Education which oversees New York Public Schools, with more than one million students, released guidelines and protocols for transgender students that advised educators that some students do not want their parents to know about their gender status. Students do not need parental consent or a court-ordered name and gender change before changing their name and pronouns at school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montgomery County Public School in Maryland, which enrolls about 160,000 students, has a &ldquo;Guidelines for Student Gender Identity&rdquo; that stated that students have the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to keep their gender transitions a secret from their parents. Educators must &ldquo;respect the right of students to keep their gender identity or transgender status private and confidential.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upper Moreland School District in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, added a &ldquo;Code of Conduct&rdquo; for the 2022-2023 school year which tells elementary school teachers that they should not share if a student has or is making a change in their gender identity with the student&rsquo;s parents unless instructed by the child. A presentation to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District Board of Education, which enrolls about 134,000 students, detailed district policy that stated that a student can request a name or pronoun change at school without parental consent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Eric Adams slams Biden's border crisis from El Paso, says New York has 'no room' for more migrants</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After surveying the US-Mexico border this weekend, New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams called on the Biden administration to do more to address the massive influx of illegal immigrants that is causing a border crisis and overwhelming New York, and other major cities. He called the situation at the border a "national crisis," and said New York has "no room" for more migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams said Friday that New York City, which has proclaimed itself a "sanctuary city" is at its "breaking point" as record numbers of illegal migrants continue to arrive in the Big Apple. Over 3,100 migrants seeking asylum showed up last week, with more than 800 arriving on Thursday alone. Adams has said "there's no room at the inn."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Fox News, the mayor submitted an emergency mutual aid request to New York State this weekend for immediate assistance to shelter the illegal migrants. Thousands of illegal migrants have been bused to New York City by the city of El Paso, as well as by the state of Texas since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City has a right to shelter law in place, meaning that anyone who seeks shelter will be granted a place to sleep. This law was made with New York's average number of homeless in mind, and New York simply does not have enough shelter for the huge increases they are seeing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunday afternoon, Adams spoke at a press conference alongside El Paso Democratic Mayor Oscar Leeser, saying, "We&rsquo;re pointing the finger &hellip; at our national government. This is a national problem. We must have real immigration reform, and we must immediately have a short-term fix of making sure that the cost of this does not fall on our local cities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams added that the illegal migrants are given a false impression from websites before they travel that The Big Apple is "paved with gold" and that they will be &ldquo;given employment" when they arrive. "Our cities are being undermined. And we don&rsquo;t deserve this. Migrants don&rsquo;t deserve this. And people who live in the cities don&rsquo;t deserve this," Adams continued. "We expect more from our national leaders to address this issue in a real way."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/san-frans-reparations-committee-proposes-5-million-each-longtime-black-resident-total-debt-forgiveness"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/san-frans-reparations-committee-proposes-5-million-each-longtime-black-resident-total-debt-forgiveness</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Fran's reparations committee proposes $5 million to each Black longtime resident, total debt forgiveness</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco&rsquo;s reparations committee has proposed paying each Black longtime resident $5 million and granting total debt forgiveness due to the decades of "systematic repression" faced by the local Black community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco African American Reparations Advisory Committee, which advises the city on developing a plan for reparations for Black residents, released its draft report last month to address reparations &ndash; not for slavery, since California was not technically a slave state, but "to address the public policies explicitly created to subjugate Black people in San Francisco by upholding and expanding the intent and legacy of chattel slavery."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft plan includes a long list of financial recommendations for Black San Francisco residents, including a one-time, lump sum payment of $5 million to each eligible individual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for the program, the applicant must be 18 years old and have identified as Black or African American on public documents for at least 10 years. They must also prove at least two of eight additional criteria, choosing from a list that includes, "Born in San Francisco between 1940 and 1996 and has proof of residency in San Francisco for at least 13 years," and/or, "Personally, or the direct descendant of someone, incarcerated by the failed War on Drugs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan also calls on the city to supplement lower-income recipients&rsquo; income to reflect the Area Median Income (AMI), about $97,000, annually for at least 250 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan also seeks to establish "a comprehensive debt forgiveness program" that clears each eligible person&rsquo;s student and housing loans, credit card debt, etc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden spars over classified documents in garage with Fox News' Peter Doocy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden sparred with Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy on Thursday, following revelations that a second batch of classified documents had been discovered at one of Biden's homes in Delaware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House Counsel's Office announced the discovery on Thursday, saying it had initiated a search of Biden's homes in Rehoboth Beach and Wilmington after news of the first stash broke this week and found documents in the Wilmington home's garage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Il8R4BEhrjo"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Fox News presses Biden over classified docs in garage: 'What were you thinking?'&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Il8R4BEhrjo&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Fox News presses Biden over classified docs in garage: 'What were you thinking?'</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play Video</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House lawyers say they immediately contacted the DOJ when they discovered the documents this week. There has been no indication of what the documents contain or whether Biden or anyone else read them after he left office as vice president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wilmington documents are the second stash of Obama-era classified documents to be uncovered. The first collection was found at the Washington office of the Penn Biden Center, a Biden-aligned think tank.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/more-americans-id-as-republicans-than-democrats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/more-americans-id-as-republicans-than-democrats</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Americans identify as Republicans than Democrats</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in decades, more people identify as Republicans than Democrats, a striking change that bolsters polls showing that the United States is a moderate-conservative nation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest massive Gallup survey of 10,000 adults, 45% identified as Republicans and 44% as Democrats. That&rsquo;s a tiny edge for sure, but it&rsquo;s the first time the GOP has had the lead since former President George H.W. Bush launched the Gulf War in 1991.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup said: &ldquo;A virtual tie in party identification and leaning represents one of the better outcomes for the Republican Party over the past three decades.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when the choice of independents is thrown in, more U.S. adults picked that label. &ldquo;Since 2009, independent identification has grown and reached levels not seen before. Now, political independents (41%) greatly outnumber Republican (28%) and Democratic (28%) identifiers,&rdquo; said Gallup on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a related survey, the polling giant also said that America politically is a moderate-conservative nation. When asked to describe their political views, 47% of adults said moderate, 30% conservative, and 21% liberal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That survey also revealed that the Democrats are more liberal than ever. &ldquo;After hovering near 50% in recent years, the percentage of Democrats who identify as politically liberal rose four percentage points in 2022 to 54%, a new high for this group,&rdquo; said Gallup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.based-politics.com/2023/01/11/these-5-states-lost-the-most-population-in-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.based-politics.com/2023/01/11/these-5-states-lost-the-most-population-in-2022/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These 5 states lost the most population in 2022</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another year is in the books, which means there&rsquo;s another year of data to analyze, too. And the Tax Foundation just published an interesting analysis shedding light on which states gained the most population in 2022&mdash;and which ones saw residents leave in droves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis examined the time period between July 2021 and July 2022 and found overall US population growth was at 0.4%, but some states&rsquo; populations shrank while others grew. As it turns out, the state that gained the most population was Florida, which saw 1.9% population growth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states that gained 1% population include Idaho, South Carolina, Texas, South Dakota, Montana, Delaware, Arizona, North Carolina, Utah, Tennessee, Georgia, and Nevada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the 5 states that lost the most population were:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York (-0.9%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois (-0.8%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana (-0.8%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Virginia (-0.6%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii (-0.5%)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noticing any trends yet?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, the states losing population are blue states with high taxes and heavily restricted economies. On the other hand, the booming states, like Florida, South Carolina, and Texas, are red states with lower tax burdens and less-regulated economies. That&rsquo;s just speculation, but it&rsquo;s borne out in the data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;People move for many reasons,&rdquo; the Tax Foundation explains. &ldquo;Sometimes taxes are expressly part of the calculation. Often, they play an indirect role (by contributing to a broadly favorable economic environment). And other times, of course, they don&rsquo;t factor in at all. The Census data and these industry studies cannot tell us exactly why each person moved, but there is no denying a very strong correlation between low-tax, low-cost states and population growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It really is becoming so glaring that even New York Governor Kathy Hochul recently admitted their state needs to address its population drain&mdash;months after telling Republicans to &ldquo;get out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As twitter user Jim Stinson tweeted: If you tell people to leave, they will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you over-regulate them and overtax them, they will leave faster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/out-of-left-field-uscs-school-of-social-work-bans-the-word-field-because-its-racist-apparently"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/out-of-left-field-uscs-school-of-social-work-bans-the-word-field-because-its-racist-apparently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USC&rsquo;s School Of Social Work Bans The Word &lsquo;Field&rsquo; Because It&rsquo;s Racist, Apparently</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever aspired to be the best in your field? Did you ever refer to doing a job outside of the office as &ldquo;field work?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if you answered yes to any of those questions, then you may unwittingly be promoting racism and bigotry &mdash; according to the University of Southern California School of Social Work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems wokeness knows no bounds &mdash; which is entirely the point of those who promote it. They have no limit in their zeal to assert power and are willing to coerce you into following along with their plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 9, the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work sent an email to faculty, staff, and students notifying them that the department has new speech code guidelines in order to ensure &ldquo;inclusive language and practice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Specifically, we have decided to remove the term &lsquo;field,&rsquo; from our curriculum and practice and replace it with &lsquo;practicum,'&rdquo; the letter explained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is so egregious about the word &ldquo;field&rdquo;? Well, according to the brainiacs out on the West Coast, it is offensive to black and immigrants everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Language can be powerful, and phrases such as &lsquo;going into the field&rsquo; or &lsquo;fieldwork&rsquo; may have connotations for descendants of slavery and immigrant workers that are not benign,&rdquo; according to the letter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a word isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;benign&rdquo; that would mean it is malignant. Per the letter sent around, the word &ldquo;field&rdquo; is so malevolent that merely using it promotes &ldquo;white supremacy, anti-immigrant and anti-blackness ideologies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the school is beginning to put its words into action by banning the term altogether.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In doing so, of course, they are unwittingly revealing their own racism by implying that only black people and immigrants work in &ldquo;fields.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t need to be said, but of course, every civilization on earth has had &ldquo;fields&rdquo; in one form or another and somebody who worked there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://humanevents.com/2023/01/11/italian-mp-giorgia-meloni-mimics-desantis-sends-migrants-to-left-run-cities?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://humanevents.com/2023/01/11/italian-mp-giorgia-meloni-mimics-desantis-sends-migrants-to-left-run-cities?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italian PM Giorgia Meloni Pulls a DeSantis, Sends Migrants to Left-Run Cities</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is facing a fierce backlash from their left-wing detractors after directing NGO ships carrying illegal migrants to ports in cities governed by pro-migration mayors, a move immediately compared to a policy ordered by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a recent security decree, authorities are now redirecting vessels that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to ports located farther away from the search and rescue area, frequently opting for cities governed by leftist mayors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the decree has been met with opposition from the left-leaning Democratic Party and the mayors of the affected cities, both of whom argue the measures are excessive and go against the supposed advantages of mass illegal migration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these concerns were rubbished by Wand Ferro, the undersecretary at Italy&rsquo;s Interior Ministry, who said: &ldquo;The left protests because NGO ships are finally disembarking in other regions of central Italy and no longer only in the South. Evidently, on the left, they would like to transform Calabria and Sicily into the refugee camp of Europe, a completely unacceptable prospect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferro stated that the asylum centers in southern Italy have faced persistent strain for years and that the government's action to alleviate that pressure amount to a necessary response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also dismissed the criticisms from NGOs who operate the migrant transport ships, pointing out that it is not unusual for these ships to keep refugees at sea for extended periods while waiting to pick up more migrants, adding that these ships have a tendency to take migrants to European ports instead of closer ports located in North Africa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Perhaps the left suffers from a sort of NIMBY [not in my backyard] syndrome, preaching welcome as long as it is away from their backyard,&rdquo; Ferro continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, NGOs who help facilitate these routes of illegal migration complained in a joint statement that the policy is hindering their efforts to save stranded migrants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Among other rules, the Italian government requires civilian rescue ships to head to Italy after each rescue immediately," the statement reads. "This delays further lifesaving operations, as ships usually carry out multiple rescues over the course of several days."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy of the Meloni conservative government, which came to power in last October's general election, immediately drew comparisons to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who last year sent illegal migrants to the wealthy, heavily liberal island enclave of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move sparked outrage from wealthy residents, with local authorities opting to activate the National Guard in order to have the individuals quickly removed.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Thursday, January 12th, 2022. We&rsquo;ve got a lot of news to get to folks, so let&rsquo;s get right to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-vote-against-bill-requiring-medical-care-babies-born-alive-abortion-attempt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-vote-against-bill-requiring-medical-care-babies-born-alive-abortion-attempt</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">210 Democrats vote against bill requiring medical care for babies born alive after abortion attempt</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly every House Democrat on Wednesday voted against legislation that would require immediate medical attention for babies who are born alive after an attempt was made to abort them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which says any infant born alive after an attempted abortion is a "legal person for all purposes under the laws of the United States." Doctors would be required to care for those infants as a "reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill passed 220-210, and all 210 of the "no" votes came from Democrats. Only one Democrat voted for the bill &mdash; Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas &mdash; and one other Democrat, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, voted "present."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that level of care, doctors would be required admit those infants to a hospital for further care. Any violation of this standard would result in fines and imprisonment for up to five years, or both.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans argued on the floor that comments from Virginia&rsquo;s former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam are an example of why the law needs to be clarified to protect newborn infants who survive abortions. Northam was talking about third-trimester abortions and appeared to indicate support for delivering babies that might still be alive before taking their life outside the womb.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We all know in 2019, then-Gov. Northam of the state of Virginia stated this: 'The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that&rsquo;s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,'" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The cavalier attitude he displayed towards human life is just wrong," Jordan said. "It is simple. Infants born alive following an abortion are kids, are children. All newborns deserve the same level of care."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Democrats overwhelmingly rejected the bill. Some, like Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., argued that the bill would set up new requirements that would "directly interfere with the doctors&rsquo; medical judgment and dictate a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all circumstances."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and other Democrats said the requirement to eventually take infants who survive abortion to a hospital may not be in the best interest of the family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats said the bill is unnecessary because it is already illegal to kill newborn infants, but Republicans accused Democrats of opposing the legislation to further their radical agenda of abortion on demand.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2023/01/11/breaking-faa-grounds-all-outbound-domestic-flights-as-system-crashes-n523027"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2023/01/11/breaking-faa-grounds-all-outbound-domestic-flights-as-system-crashes-n523027</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAA grounds all outbound domestic flights as system crashes; Update: FAA lifts ground stop</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this writing, the FAA has grounded all outbound domestic flights until at least 9 am ET. It may take longer than that to restore service to its NOTAM system, the on-line platform that all commercial and military pilots must consult before taking off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disruption began hours earlier, and the FAA has apparently struggled to overcome it. Savannah Guthrie calls it a &ldquo;sweeping outage,&rdquo; and it will almost certainly impact flights for hours even after the FAA restores it:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1613145694923096065"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1613145694923096065</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FAA lifted the national ground stop a few minutes ago, but it&rsquo;s not clear whether the NOTAM system has been fully restored or they&rsquo;re using work-arounds. They reopened two airports without out NOTAM due to &ldquo;air congestion&rdquo; prior to ending the ground stop:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican President Praises Biden for Not Building Border Wall Even When &lsquo;Conservatives Don&rsquo;t Like It&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has praised President Joe Biden for taking a stand against the U.S. border wall, and criticized conservatives during the North American Leaders&rsquo; Summit on Tuesday. It comes as the United States sees a surge in illegal immigration across the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You, President Biden, you are the first president of the United States in a very long time that has not built not even one meter of wall. And that&mdash;we thank you for that, sir, although some might not like it&mdash;although the conservatives don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Lopez Obrador said in a joint press conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thanked Biden for maintaining a &ldquo;relationship of cooperation&rdquo; with Mexico and for not subjecting Mexicans who &ldquo;live and work in a very honest fashion&rdquo; in the United States to harassment. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not suffering raids as it unfortunately used to happen in the past,&rdquo; the Mexican president added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez Obrador asked Biden to insist that Congress &ldquo;regularize the migration situations&rdquo; of millions of Mexicans who have been living in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 21, 2021, a day after becoming president, Biden issued an executive order that halted construction of the border wall, commenting that a massive wall spanning the entire southern border is &ldquo;not a serious policy solution&rdquo; and a &ldquo;waste of money.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2017 and 2020, 450 miles of the wall were authorized and built under the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July last year, the Department of Homeland Security announced that the remaining funds, which were allocated for the construction of the wall along the Mexico&ndash;U.S. border, would be spent on &ldquo;environmental remediation and mitigation&rdquo; as well as for installing cameras, lighting, and detection technology in places where barriers are already built.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Biden administration, illegal immigrants entering via the southern border have surged. During fiscal year 2020, there were 458,088 apprehensions. This rose to 1.73 million in fiscal year 2021, a jump of 278 percent, data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During fiscal year 2022, apprehensions rose to 2.3 million. In the first two months of fiscal year 2023, apprehensions exceeded the total apprehensions of fiscal year 2020. According to Steven Kopits with Princeton Policy Advisors, the rise in border crossers is set to continue its upward trend this year as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kopits had earlier predicted around 2 million apprehensions for 2021 and 2.3 million for 2022, which is close to the actual numbers. For 2023, Kopits is predicting apprehensions to hit 2.6 million, another record in terms of annual illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Kopits&rsquo;s projections are true, it would mean that 6.9 million illegal aliens would have been apprehended between 2021 and 2023 under the Biden administration.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-life pregnancy center hires private investigators to look into attack, blasts FBI: 'Where's the manhunt?'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A network of pro-life pregnancy centers in New York hired private investigators to probe a firebomb attack against a facility last June after what they describe as an inadequate response from federal law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They've been responsive, but what they've done we don't know," Tom Brejcha, president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Society, told Fox News Digital of the FBI.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CompassCare, which has multiple pro-life pregnancy centers in upstate New York, announced last week that it was joining forces with the society, a nonprofit law firm, to hire private investigators to find those behind the incident at their Buffalo office last summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vandals reportedly smashed windows and lit fires in the building's reception room and nurses&rsquo; office, then defaced the building with "Jane was here" graffiti, an apparent reference to the radical pro-abortion group Jane's Revenge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pro-life pregnancy center was able to rebuild quickly, but the individuals responsible have not been apprehended.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brejcha, who told Fox News Digital that his own home was targeted last July by "40 to 50 masked, black-clad thugs," said the investigation has expanded to include all 78 of the attacks against pro-life facilities in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Along with CompassCare and others, we're looking to investigate connections here," the lawyer explained. "We have security video of attackers. We have license plates. We're pursuing the kind of investigation that lawyers pursue when they're looking to achieve justice on behalf of their clients, civil and criminal. So we're not sitting on our hands just writing letters to the editor about it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brejcha said they hope to reveal "some of the folks that are behind this," and he is optimistic that they will succeed.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biological males blocked from competing in women's school sports in West Virginia: federal court</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge in West Virginia has upheld a state law preventing male athletes who identify as female from participating in female school sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a ruling on January 5, Judge Joseph R. Goodwin of the Southern District of West Virginia said that HB 3293, the Save Women&rsquo;s Sports Bill, was "constitutionally permissible." The bill defines "girl" and "women" as biologically female for the purpose of secondary school sports and Goodwin found that this was "substantially related to its important interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law was first introduced in March 2021 but was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The ACLU represented trans-identified male middle school student Becky Pepper-Jackson who was barred from the girls' cross-country team. This, the ACLU argued, was a violation of Pepper-Jackson&rsquo;s rights under the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, the federal state statute that prohibits sex-based discrimination, reports Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Goodwin ruled in favor of the ACLU and blocked the law at the preliminary stage, ruling that Pepper-Jackson was being excluded from school sports on the basis of sex making it a Title IX violation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Goodwin acknowledged in his new decision that the law was seeking to "prevent transgender girls from playing on girls&rsquo; sports teams," he highlighted the biological differences between males and females that give males a significant sporting advantage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While some females may be able to outperform some males, it is generally accepted that, on average, males outperform females athletically because of inherent physical differences between the sexes. This is not an overbroad generalization, but rather a general principle that realistically reflects the average physical differences between the sexes," said the judge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwin also noted that while Pepper-Jackson had taken puberty blockers, not all transgender athletes do. Some only socially transition, while others take blockers and hormones at a later stage in puberty. Goodwin stated that "there is much debate over whether and to what extent hormone therapies after puberty can reduce a transgender girl's athletic advantage over cisgender girls."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The fact is, however, that a transgender girl is biologically male and, barring medical intervention, would undergo male puberty like other biological males. And biological males generally outperform females athletically. The state is permitted to legislate sports rules on this basis because sex, and the physical characteristics that flow from it, are substantially related to athletic performance and fairness in sports," Goodwin ruled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West Virginia ACLU had filed the lawsuit alleging that banning girls from participating in school sports because they are transgender is unconstitutional.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2019 speech, developmental biologist Dr. Emma Hilton demonstrated just how wide the gap between the athletic performance of biological males and females is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"So big is the gap, there are 9000 males between 100m world record holders Usain Bolt and FloJo. So early does the gap emerge, the current female 100m Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson, is slower than the 14-year-old schoolboy record holder," said Hilton.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEYTON HILLIS IS REPORTEDLY STILL IN CRITICAL CONDITION</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors have given an update on the condition of former NFL running back Peyton Hillis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Hillis was rushed to the hospital after a swimming incident at a Florida beach. He reportedly rescued his two children who were in danger of drowning in the ocean. Both children were reportedly uninjured in the incident</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WREG Memphis reporter Otis Kirk reported that he had been told that Hillis is &ldquo;battling and definitely needs as many prayers as he can get.&rdquo; He also reported that the former Razorback&rsquo;s kidneys and lungs were the primary reasons why he was still in the hospital. WREG&rsquo;s report mentioned that Hillis&rsquo; kidneys are now the main concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirk did not reveal who gave him this information or their relationship with Hillis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He played both high school and college football in the state, before embarking on an NFL career that took him to Cleveland, Denver, New York, and Kansas City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at Arkansas, Hillis was one part of a running back triumvirate comprised of himself, Darren McFadden, and Felix Jones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report on Hillis&rsquo; condition comes just as a prayer vigil was being held in his native Arkansas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillis volunteers as an assistant for his son&rsquo;s football team. Bryant Davis, who is coach and head of the program, was at the vigil and spoke to KSFM-TV. He talked about the importance of community support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;One of the great things about being a body of believers is relationship and community, and it&rsquo;s about being not only here to pray for people, but it&rsquo;s also here, Bryant said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also to be here to support them through times like this.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republican files articles of impeachment against DHS Sec. Mayorkas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon has filed impeachment articles against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, delivering on a promise he made last week before the 118th Congress was officially sworn in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The articles of impeachment against Mayorkas for "high crimes and misdemeanors," known as House Resolution 8, were introduced by Fallon in the House on Monday and have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Fallon vowed to file impeachment articles against Mayorkas after the Congress was sworn in. The effort from Republicans in the House is one of many that the new GOP majority will take as it works to fight the Biden administration on issues related to immigration and the southern border crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is currently no text available for the impeachment articles filed against Mayorkas, Fox News reported last week that Fallon's first article alleges that Mayorkas has failed to faithfully execute the "Secure the Fence Act of 2006." The article says that law requires the secretary of Homeland Security to "maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second article alleges that Mayorkas, "in violation of his constitutional oath, willfully provided perjurious, false, and misleading testimony to Congress." To back up that charge, the article quotes Mayorkas' testimony during April 26 and Nov. 15 congressional hearings in which he said the border was secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final of the three articles charges that Mayorkas "publicly and falsely slandered" border agents who were accused &ndash; but later cleared &ndash; of whipping Haitian migrants in Del Rio, Texas, in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayorkas on Sunday said he will not resign over his handling of the border crisis and insisted he will be ready for future investigations by House Republicans while continuing to fulfill his daily responsibilities.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reps. Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell, Ilhan Omar To Officially Be Kicked Off Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committees</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy confirmed Monday night that Democratic California Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell will be removed from the House Intelligence Committee and the House will vote on the removal of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, McCarthy told the Daily Caller that if he is elected Speaker that he intends to strip Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee and Swalwell and Schiff from the Intelligence Committee. On Monday, McCarthy confirmed to The Associated Press (AP) that he would be moving forward with that decision, saying both Swalwell and Schiff should not have seats on the committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy has said Swalwell&rsquo;s reported relationship with a Chinese spy and Schiff&rsquo;s defense of the Steele dossier are some of the reasons they should be removed from the committee. McCarthy has said Omar&rsquo;s anti-Semitism is a reason she should be removed from Foreign Affairs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Swalwell can&rsquo;t get a security clearance in the private sector. I&rsquo;m not going to give him a government security clearance. Schiff has lied to the American public&hellip;,&rdquo; McCarthy told The AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Caller contacted Swalwell, Schiff, and Omar&rsquo;s offices about McCarthy&rsquo;s decision to move forward and have them removed from committee assignments to which they did not immediately respond.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Tate to remain in Romanian jail after losing appeal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former kickboxer and controversial social media personality Andrew Tate lost his appeal against not being held for 30 days at a Romanian detention center. Andrew, along with his brother Tristan, were detained last month pending a criminal investigation into alleged human trafficking and organizing a crime group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A document from the judge who instated the 30-day detention wrote that "the possibility of them evading investigations cannot be ignored" and the suspects could "leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition," reports Mirror.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In this sense, I would like to point out, at least from this point of view, I am also somehow amazed, there is not a single piece of evidence apart from the victim's statement that leads to the idea that a crime of rape was committed. In my view, there is no evidence to the formation of an opinion of reasonable suspicion regarding the commission of offenses provided for and punishable by criminal law. In this case we are talking about human trafficking and organized crime," said the Tate brothers' lawyer Eugen Vidineac.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon pledges to affirm sex changes for kids as reading proficiency plummets</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Oregon Department of Education released guidance for schools to better support "Gender Expansive Students" that include bathroom and pronoun policies aligned with radical gender ideology and include links for minors to seek "gender-affirming healthcare"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LibsofTikTok posted "Oregon Dept of Education released new guidelines on affirming LGBTQ+ students. They promote the use of pronouns, using bathrooms based on gender identity, and support 'gender affirming care' for minors. It also provides links to kids with info on 'tucking' &amp; 'chest binding'."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon Department of Education Director Colt Gill said, "It is our responsibility to move beyond mere tolerance and inclusion toward respectful, affirming, and celebratory school communities where all students belong and succeed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new guidance comes as a growing number of Oregon students are falling behind in their reading proficiency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Oregon Live, "A staggering 61 percent of third graders and 54 percent of seventh graders aren&rsquo;t fully proficient at reading, including 30 percent of seventh-graders found to be substantially below grade level" in the Beaver State.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures of success according to the guidance include telling students, "You have the ability to change your first name in your school record and student information system, without legal documentation" and "You have the ability to change your sex/gender marker in your school record and student information system."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You have the ability to use school restrooms and changing rooms that align with your gender identity or safety needs," according to the guidance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance also includes informing students they can "date who you want, if you want" and can form student groups focused on LGBTQ2SIA+.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan offers textbooks and guidance to students so they can learn "inclusive and affirming information about the LGBTQ2SIA+" community and inform the students they can participate in "sports, PE, and school activities according to your gender identity."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"If you are 15 or older, you have the ability to seek gender-affirming healthcare from an Oregon medical provider," according to the list of resources, which also remind students they can seek mental health resources if they are 14 or over and get birth control if they are "any age."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance provides a detailed list instructing students where they can receive "gender affirming care" that includes details on "tucking" and "chest binding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent guidance release is part of Oregon's larger LGBTQ2SIA+ Student Success Plan that was developed in 2020 "amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic."</span></p>
