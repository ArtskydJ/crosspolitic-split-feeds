<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DeSantis expands Florida's state of emergency as Hurricane Idalia to make landfall Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded a state of emergency to include more counties as the southern U.S. braces for Hurricane Idalia to make landfall Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 33 of Florida's 67 counties were under the previous executive order, DeSantis' updated order issued Monday now includes 46 counties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service said Tuesday that Idalia is "expected to rapidly intensify into an extremely dangerous major hurricane" before making landfall.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis said Monday that Idalia is expected to develop into at least a category 3 hurricane by the time it makes landfall, according to CBS News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service states that with a category 3 hurricane, "devastating damage will occur," and things such as utilities, trees and well-built homes may incur major damages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for Idalia's landfall, DeSantis fully activated the Florida National Guard, and 5,500 are expected to be mobilized to respond to the storm. Additionally, dozens of public schools have closed down and the state government is taking additional steps to ensure people have access to food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden posted Monday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that he spoke with DeSantis "to inform him that we've approved the Emergency Declaration for Florida as they prepare for Hurricane Idalia," and he said, "Florida has my full support as they prepare for Idalia and its aftermath."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/kyle-rittenhouse-sued-by-estate-of-the-child-molester-he-blew-away-in-self-defense"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/kyle-rittenhouse-sued-by-estate-of-the-child-molester-he-blew-away-in-self-defense</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Rittenhouse sued by estate of the convicted child molester he blew away in self-defense</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Rittenhouse shot three attackers who mobbed him during a leftist riot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020. Two of the three are no more. He was cleared of all charges in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being found not guilty by a jury of his peers, Rittenhouse has since had to fight various efforts to paint him as a villain and to punish him for defending himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent attempt comes in the form of a civil lawsuit filed by the convicted child molester Joseph Rosenbaum's estate Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Scorecard reported that the suit names Rittenhouse as a defendant along with local sheriff's departments, Kenosha officials, the City of Kenosha, the City of West Allis, and various counties, demanding "compensatory and punitive damages" for the "wrongful death" of Rosenbaum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post noted that Rosenbaum spent most of his adult life in prison after preying upon five preteen boys.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears his life on the outside was marked by rage and rootlessness. For instance, one month prior to his demise, Rosenbaum's fianc&eacute;e, Kariann Swart, pressed charges against him for domestic abuse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just hours before catching four bullets, the homeless and bipolar 36-year-old had been released from a hospital following a suicide attempt, reported NPR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh out of the hospital, Rosenbaum joined in the destructive riots that kicked off in response to the non-fatal police shooting of Jacob Blake, whom state prosecutors indicated had been wanted on a felony warrant and was armed with a knife.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rittenhouse's lawyers claimed during his murder trial that Rosenbaum attempted to "engage" the youth, at which point Rittenhouse attempted to flee. Rosenbaum gave chase, threw a sack of belongings at him, then, according to witness testimony, attempted to disarm the then-17-year-old by force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footage of the incident shows that it was only when the 17-year-old appeared cornered in a car lot did he open fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to claiming Rosenbaum was a peaceful protester who "was not a danger to himself or others," the Rosenbaum estate cast Rittenhouse in the lawsuit as a menace who "fired his assault rifle indiscriminately multiple times," despite the 17-year-old's documented restraint and sure aim.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Rosenbaum can be seen on film chasing down the boy, the suit alleges that "there was no justification for Defendant Rittenhouse to point his weapon at Joseph Rosenbaum."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Federal judge dismisses University of Wyoming students' lawsuit against trans sorority member</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Wyoming sorority members&rsquo; lawsuit for the inclusion of a transgender student in their organization was dismissed by a federal judge on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, several current and former members of the University of Wyoming&rsquo;s Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority sued the national sorority to revoke the membership allowing what they described as "peeping" transgender student Artemis Langford. Despite the women&rsquo;s descriptions of Langford&rsquo;s alleged actions, the judge ruled that the school did not violate any policies by allowing the student to join.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The University of Wyoming chapter voted to admit - and, more broadly, a sorority of hundreds of thousands approved - Langford. With its inquiry beginning and ending there, the Court will not define &lsquo;woman&rsquo; today. The delegate of a private, voluntary organization interpreted &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, otherwise undefined in the nonprofit's bylaws, expansively; this Judge may not invade Kappa Kappa Gamma's freedom of expressive association and inject the circumscribed definition Plaintiffs urge," the judge said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling continued, "Holding that Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege their derivative, breach of contract, tortious interference, and direct claims, the Court dismisses, without prejudice, Plaintiffs' causes of action."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit brought by seven members of Kappa Kappa Gamma claimed that Langford violated sorority policies by joining a sorority despite not being a woman or making efforts to appear female.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden Seeks Long-Term Military Aid to Ukraine to Prevent Next President From Scaling Back Funding</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration is seeking to hammer out a long-term Ukraine aid agreement with European allies in hopes of both preventing Russia from gaining an edge on the battlefield and hamstringing a future president&rsquo;s ability to scale back U.S. commitments, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scheme emerged during sideline talks among Group of Seven leaders at a NATO summit in July, and so far involves negotiations between the U.S. and Ukraine, and between the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ukraine, according to the WSJ. It&rsquo;s an attempt, in part, to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin he can simply wait until a new American administration, as several top GOP political contenders have expressed intention to reduce or eliminate U.S. aid that makes up the brunt of Western support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building up Kyiv&rsquo;s defense forces in the long term can theoretically deter Russia from invading again, officials calculated, according to the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump has maintained a lead in Republican primary candidate polling and could face a second showdown with President Joe Biden in the 2024 election. Trump has claimed he could solve the war &ldquo;within 24 hours.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the first Republican primary debate Wednesday, several candidates indicated they would support drawing down aid for Ukraine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighteen countries not belonging to the G-7 wealthy democracies, including the Netherlands and Sweden, have also agreed to the long-term security assistance pledge for Ukraine, according to the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European capitals want to cement support and restrict ways countries could renege on pledges, fearing what might happen during a second Trump administration, according to the WSJ. At present, Western European nations lack the industrial and financial capacity to match the billions in annual military aid provided by the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has devoted more than $40 billion worth of weapons and equipment, as well as training and investment into U.S. weapons companies, for the purpose of aiding Ukraine&rsquo;s resistance. The aid has exposed weaknesses in American military readiness and industrial base capacity, provoking criticism that the U.S. should be using those funds to shore up defenses with an eye toward China as the war in Ukraine drags on with no end in sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the practical workings of the agreement pose significant hurdles to the Biden administration&rsquo;s goals, the WSJ reported, citing officials. A sitting president has limited ability to bind his successor to any initiative or policy.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>UNC-Chapel Hill faculty member killed in shooting that sent campus into lockdown</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill faculty member was killed Monday in a shooting that prompted a campuswide lockdown while officials searched for an "armed and dangerous person," university officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A suspect was captured about an hour and a half after the shooting at Caudill Laboratories, and an all-clear alert was issued for the campus about two hours after that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No other injuries were reported, schools officials said at a briefing Monday afternoon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am devastated and saddened by today&rsquo;s shooting in one of our campus buildings, a place where we conduct our important work of teaching, mentoring and research every day," UNC Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz said in a letter to the university community. "This shooting damages the trust and safety that we so often take for granted on our campus. We will work to rebuild that trust and safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university first alerted students of an armed and dangerous person on or near campus shortly after 1 p.m.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 2:24 p.m., the university issued an alert to remain sheltered in place because a suspect was at large. Video from campus showed a large police presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When campus police released a photo of a person of interest at 2:35 p.m., they warned, "If you see this person, keep your distance, put your safety first and call 911."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school said at 3:14 p.m. that all classes and events were canceled Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement that officials "are taking precautions to protect campus safety following today&rsquo;s shooting."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is a tragic way to start a new semester and the state will provide any assistance necessary to support the UNC community,&rdquo; Cooper said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one with the university was immediately reached Monday afternoon for additional comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials with the FBI in Charlotte said the federal agency is assisting local law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-trumps-dc-trial-date-set-for-march-4-one-day-before-super-tuesday?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-trumps-dc-trial-date-set-for-march-4-one-day-before-super-tuesday?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trump's DC trial date set for March 4&mdash;one day before Super Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DC federal Judge Tanya Chutkan has set March 4, 2024 as the trial date for Trump's case over the aftermath of the 2020 election. This is the day before Super Tuesday, when 14 states, including California and Texas, head to the polls to determine the GOP nominee for president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case, brought by special counsel Jack Smith, alleges that Trump engaged in conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct and official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Trump's trial in Manhattan, brought by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, is set to start March 25, 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In setting the date, Chutkan reportedly spoke to the New York judge who is overseeing the "falsified business documents" case in New York.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Setting a trial date does not depend and should not depend on a defendant's personal obligations," Chutkan said, comparing Trump's campaign obligations to those of a professional athlete, whose schedule would also not be considered when setting trial dates in a criminal case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 12.8 million pages of discovery have been given by the DOJ to Trump's defense. Special counsel prosecutor Molly Gaston said that "at this point, discovery is now substantially complete."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's attorneys are likely to file many motions in the coming weeks, and John Lauro, representing the president, said that Trump is essentially being prosecuted for "being President Trump." Lauro is reportedly preparing a motion to dismiss the entire case over selective prosecution, saying "it provides an advantage to these prosecutors' boss who's running a campaign against President Trump."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has asserted his belief that the 4 cases currently against him, two from Biden's DOJ and one each in Georgia and New York, constitute election interference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Trump was impeached the first time, it was on the basis of election interference. Congress alleged that Trump encouraging an investigation by Ukraine into Joe Biden's influence on the judicial system while he was VP, more than a year prior to the US presidential election of 2020, constituted election interference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House said that Tump "acting both directly and through his agents within and outside the United States Government&mdash;corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into&mdash; a political opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the Biden administration is ordering these public trials, and that is not being characterized as election interference. Just weeks before the first indictment, Biden officials reportedly met with Jack Smith. This despite Biden continuously saying that the DOJ is independent.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-12443319/Mask-study-published-NIH-suggests-N95-Covid-masks-expose-wearers-dangerous-level-toxic-compounds-linked-seizures-cancer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-12443319/Mask-study-published-NIH-suggests-N95-Covid-masks-expose-wearers-dangerous-level-toxic-compounds-linked-seizures-cancer.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mask study published by NIH suggests N95 Covid masks may expose wearers to dangerous level of toxic compounds linked to seizures and cancer</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgical N95 mask has been held up as the gold standard when it comes to protecting against Covid.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a study quietly re-shared by the National Institutes of Health in spring suggests the tight-fitting mask may expose users to dangerous levels of toxic chemicals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers from Jeonbuk National University in South Korea looked at two types of disposable medical-grade masks, as well as several reusable cotton masks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that the chemicals released by these masks had eight times the recommended safety limit of toxic volatile organic compounds (TVOCs).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inhaling TVOCs has been linked to health issues like headaches and nausea, while prolonged and repeated has been linked to organ damage and even cancer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'It is clear that particular attention must be paid to the VOCs associated with the use of KF94 [medical] masks their effects on human health,' the researchers wrote in the study published April.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are ways to reduce the danger, they said. 'Exposure can be significantly reduced if a mask is opened and left to sit for at least 30 min,' the researchers wrote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This suggests that the packaging of these masks could play a role in the amount of chemicals they have.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TVOCs are a large group of odorous chemicals, many of which are released by cleaning and beauty products, burning fuel and cooking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest study, researchers tested 14 disposable and cloth masks purchased online by measuring the amount of TVOCs in them. The disposable masks were KFAD and KF94 models, which were made from thermoplastics polypropylene and polyurethane nylon.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These masks have been popularized in South Korea, where the study was conducted, whereas KN95s are more popular in the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, their differences are miniscule. KFADs and KF94s filter 94 percent of particles, while KN95s filter 95 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources of TVOCs in the home include aerosol sprays, cleansers and disinfectants, moth repellents, air fresheners and automotive products.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other sources include building materials and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, permanent markers, correction fluids, carbonless copy paper and craft materials including glues and adhesives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research carried out by the Cochrane Institute, for example, suggested that face masks made 'little to no difference' in Covid infections and deaths.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers said harms caused by masks - including hampering children's schooling - were poorly measured in the studies, meaning any small benefit on infection rates may be outweighed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a controversial study suggested that wearing face masks raises the risk of stillbirths, testicular dysfunction, and cognitive decline in children.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tucker Carlson in Negotiations to Interview Putin</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news has the left-wing media up in arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news was first announced by the Russian state-owned media outlet Russia Today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan said on Sunday that Tucker Carlson has been seeking an interview with Putin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlson has yet to comment on the news.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putin is known to shy away from one-on-one interviews with foreign media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news was broke by Kanekoa The Great on X: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1695898131781853682"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1695898131781853682</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last interview Putin did of this type with a Western journalist was an interview with CNBC anchor Hadley Gamble on the sidelines of the Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow in October 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, President Donald Trump&rsquo;s interview with Carlson was viewed 261 Million times, according to the view counter displayed on Twitter.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Trump supporters, counter-protesters clash outside of Fulton County jail ahead of his arrival</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, both supporters and opponents of 2024 GOP frontrunner Donald Trump gathered outside the Fulton County jail in expectation of his arrival to surrender to authorities in the 2020 election case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the afternoon, police had blocked off the road leading up to the jail, as a crowd gathered at the end of the road.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One person was seen standing with a "Donald J Trump did nothing wrong sign," while others flew American flags and wore red MAGA hats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One anti-Trump man wearing a black and white striped jail suit blasted a bullhorn alarm into the ear of a Trump supporter. Three more behind him were dressed as rats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday morning, Trump replaced his lead Georgia lawyer with Steve Sadow, who last represented Atlanta rapper Gunna in the YSL RICO case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump and 18 codefendants have been charged with violation of the Georgia RICO Act, solicitation of violation of oath by public officer, false statements and writings, impersonating a public officer, conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, forgery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit false statements and writings, criminal attempt to commit filing false documents, conspiracy to commit filing false documents, criminal attempt to commit influencing witnesses, influencing witnesses, conspiracy to commit election fraud, conspiracy to commit computer theft, conspiracy to commit computer trespass, conspiracy to commit computer invasion of privacy, conspiracy to defraud the state, and perjury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying with Trump&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2023/08/24/trump-tucker-interview-gets-amazing-number-of-views-n2162988"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2023/08/24/trump-tucker-interview-gets-amazing-number-of-views-n2162988</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trump Claims Debate Victory, and He Has Some Incredible Numbers to Support the Claim</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican debate was Wednesday night, and some were somewhat disappointed that the debate didn't spend time on the economy, how horrible Joe Biden is, and the weaponization of the government against political opponents and the American people. It seems like the candidates spent more time trying to verbally take on Vivek Ramaswamy than Joe Biden. It was clear that they were concerned about Ramaswamy's numbers when the rest were mainly in single digits,. They were hoping to have that springboard moment off of him. But it seemed that only focused more attention on him, rather than on them. "Vivek" was trending this morning on polls running this morning like the Drudge poll had him polling as the winner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here was perhaps one of the funniest moments of the debate when Ramaswamy came back at Chris Christie</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1694525968021647466"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1694525968021647466</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I think the problem for the folks at the debate was the guy Fox referred to as the "elephant not in the room" --- President Donald Trump. In the Fox debate format, you don't get the chance to expound on your thoughts. You're given a very limited time to make an impression, sometimes in the. midst of being shouted down or attacked by another candidate. Meanwhile, as we reported, Trump was free to speak at length and benefitted from the long-form interview format.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here was a hilarious moment where he eviscerated the abilities of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and speculated that other folks might come forward in the primary because those two were so bad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1694527574955761965"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1694527574955761965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that I found commendable in the Trump interview was that even in the face of four indictments, what was Trump talking about? The concerns about China's movements in our hemisphere, trying to build bases in Cuba, and their influence over the Panama Canal. There was precious little foreign policy in the GOP debate apart from asking about continued funding for Ukraine, which most seemed to be okay with and Ramaswamy wanted to stop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a strategic understanding that we've seen from Trump in the past for example in trying to warn Germany and NATO about being beholden to Russia for their oil. It's something that Biden completely fails at because he doesn't seem at all concerned about America's security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did any of the candidates at the GOP debate have that springboard moment to shake up the polls and move past Trump? I don't think so. There might be some minor jockeying around, but they faced an almost impossible task to begin with, with Trump so far ahead. How do you gain on him if he isn't even there?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's team released a statement after the debate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"President Trump won this evening's Republican debate in dominating fashion," said the statement attributed to Trump campaign senior adviser Susie Wiles. "More people watched President Trump's interview with Tucker Carlson than the rest of the field on the debate stage combined. Tonight, voters saw a clear contrast between President Trump engaging in a thoughtful policy discussion about what his second term will look like versus 90-second canned sound bites and platitudes from the debate stage."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiles' statement continued: "What is clear after the dust settles: none of the other candidates looked ready to take on Crooked Joe Biden. Only one leader can Make America Great Again, and that's President Donald J. Trump."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this juncture, if winning is determined by attention and eyes on you, then Trump has some receipts for the claim. According to the view count, it's almost 200 million views -- 195+ million at this juncture, after not even a full day.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Maui Survivors on Instructions from Government During Fire: &ldquo;Only Those Who Disobeyed Survived&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents in West Maui faced a barricade that blocked the only paved exit out of town when they attempted to escape the raging wildfires, according to the Associated Press, forcing them to evade the authorities&rsquo; obstacles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents encountered a gridlock caused by several Hawaiian Electric trucks that were replacing telephone poles along the road to Highway 30, and received instructions from electricians to turn back into Lahaina, AP reported. Some died in their cars while others swerved around the barricade or used dirt roads to escape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It made no sense what they were doing,&rdquo; Cole Millington, a resident, said, according to NBC News. &ldquo;They could see the sky was black. They could see the city was on fire. They could see the wind was still whipping everything around. But they were already starting to plant new power poles.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many residents could not escape the traffic and abandoned their cars to jump in the Pacific, making the gridlock even worse, according to The Washington Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The gridlock would have left us there when the firestorm came,&rdquo; Kim Cuevas-Reyes, a resident who drove into the wrong lane to escape, said, according to AP. &ldquo;I would have had to tell my children to jump into the ocean as well and be boiled alive by the flames or we would have just died from smoke inhalation and roasted in the car.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wildfires have burned approximately 2,170 acres in Lahaina, according to CBS News. There have been at least 115 deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaiian Electric did not immediately respond to requests for a comment.</span></p>

<p><strong>US Approves New $500M Arms Sale to Taiwan as Aggression from China Intensifies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has approved a $500 million arms sale to Taiwan as it ramps up military assistance to the island despite fervent objections from China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Department said Wednesday it had signed off on the sale of infrared search tracking systems along with related equipment for advanced F-16 fighter jets. The sale includes the infrared systems as well as test support and equipment, computer software and spare parts, it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the deal is modest in comparison to previous weapons sales, the move is likely to draw fierce criticism from Beijing, which regards self-governing Taiwan as a renegade province and refuses to rule out the use of force to reunify it with the mainland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient&rsquo;s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,&rdquo; the State Department said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The proposed sale will improve the recipient&rsquo;s capability to meet current and future threats by contributing to the recipient&rsquo;s abilities to defend its airspace, provide regional security, and increase interoperability with the United States through its F-16 program," it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement came just hours after Taiwan&rsquo;s President Tsai Ing-wen renewed a pledge to strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s self-defense as she visited a war memorial from the last time Taiwan and China battled. Tsai, visited the outlying islands of Kinmen where the conflict was fought 65 years ago, commemorated those who died.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday's State Department announcement also follows an angry Chinese reaction to the transit through the United States of Taiwanese Vice President William Lai on his way to and from an official visit in Paraguay last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, China has stepped up its military activity in the waters and skies around Taiwan, sending fighter jets and navy vessels near the island or to encircle it.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden Redistributes Student Loan Debt...Again</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden has again worked with administration officials to redistribute student loan debt belonging to wealthy degree holders to Americans taxpayers, most of whom never went to college.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1693962658775474442"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1693962658775474442</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to Fox Business, the new plan will cost taxpayers $276 billion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The move comes after the administration announced an additional round of bailouts earlier this month and in defiance of a recent Supreme Court ruling on the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Speaking of Biden&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-takes-action-restricting-oil-gas-development-settlement-eco-groups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-takes-action-restricting-oil-gas-development-settlement-eco-groups</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden admin takes action restricting oil, gas development after settlement with eco groups</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Biden administration issued new restrictions on oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico, in an effort to protect a whale species after it settled last month with a coalition of environmental groups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which manages energy development in federal waters, published a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) on Monday evening highlighting expanded protections for the Rice&rsquo;s whale, a species listed under the Endangered Species Act. BOEM was slated to issue the NTL last week, but delayed it until Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"This decision by the Biden Administration does an end-around legal requirements and the public process, imposing unwarranted restrictions on U.S. energy production at a time of continued inflation with prices rising at the pump for consumers," said National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He added that the agreement the administration reached with environmental groups ignores the "best science," contravenes congressional intent under the Inflation Reduction Act and threatens America's energy independence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under the NTL issued Monday, BOEM created a vast new protection zone stretching across the Gulf of Mexico with a variety of new conditions for industry operators. Among its recommendations, BOEM said specially-trained visual observers should be aboard all vessels traversing the area, all ships regardless of size should travel no quicker than 10 knots, and vessels should only travel through the area in the daytime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Those recommendations will be introduced as stipulations to Lease Sale 261, an upcoming offshore oil and gas lease auction. And BOEM removed an estimated 11 million acres of potential oil-rich lease blocks from that lease sale under its actions Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a federal stipulated stay agreement filed late last month, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) agreed to a number of conditions requested by four eco groups led by the Sierra Club which, in response, agreed to temporarily pause litigation in the related case. The case dates back nearly three years when, in October 2020, the environmental coalition sued the NMFS for failing to properly assess the oil industry impacts on endangered and threatened marine wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">They pursued the lawsuit after the NMFS coordinated a multiagency consultation studying the effects all federally regulated oil and gas activities would have on species listed under the Endangered Species Act in the Gulf of Mexico over the next 50 years. The groups argued in the original complaint that the NMFS' biological opinion resulting from its consultation was not based on the best science.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to API, the NTL solely targets oil and gas traffic while refraining from restricting vessel traffic related to other industries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/08/21/covid-mask-mandates-return-to-hollywood-lionsgate-requires-employees-to-mask-up-submit-to-daily-testing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/08/21/covid-mask-mandates-return-to-hollywood-lionsgate-requires-employees-to-mask-up-submit-to-daily-testing/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>COVID Mandates Return to Hollywood: Lionsgate Requires Employees to Mask Up, Submit to Daily Testing</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">COVID mask mandates are returning to Hollywood, with Lionsgate being the first major studio to reinstate masking and daily testing for its Los Angeles office workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Lionsgate is requiring employees who physically work at its headquarters in Santa Monica to wear masks at all times when in the building, effective immediately, except when alone in an enclosed office or large open workspace. In addition, employees are required to submit to daily COVID testing and to report the results to the company, according to an internal memo obtained by Deadline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Employees must wear &ldquo;a medical grade face covering (surgical mask, KN95 or N95) when indoors except when alone in an office with the door closed, actively eating, actively drinking at their desk or workstation, or if they are the only individual present in a large open workspace,&rdquo; the memo reportedly states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has reported a recent uptick in transmissions but &ldquo;overall metrics remain at a low level of concern.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A growing number of colleges and medical institutions throughout the country are also reinstating mask mandates, with the mainstream news media running articles pushing for the return of face coverings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former Obama official and MSNBC medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel said earlier this month on MSNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az-Balart Reports&rdquo; that a rise in COVID cases meant it was time to bring back masks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The return of mask mandates comes as the Biden administration is ramping up another round of COVID hysteria ahead of 2024, pressuring all Americans to get the latest booster this fall. This had led to growing suspicion that Democrats will not only impose mask mandates but bring back mass lockdowns ahead of the next presidential election, in a repeat of 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As Breitbart News reported, the new push for Americans to line up for booster shots follows the revelation in January that health officials want to make coronavirus booster vaccinations an annual event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/the-blind-side-author-michael-lewis-calls-out-michael-oher-amid-lawsuit-against-tuohy-family-that-hes-suspicious-of-them-is-breathtaking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/the-blind-side-author-michael-lewis-calls-out-michael-oher-amid-lawsuit-against-tuohy-family-that-hes-suspicious-of-them-is-breathtaking/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>&lsquo;The Blind Side&rsquo; Author Michael Lewis Calls Out Michael Oher Amid Lawsuit Against Tuohy Family: &ldquo;That He&rsquo;s Suspicious Of Them Is Breathtaking&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The celebrated story of Michael Oher, former NFL athlete and the subject of the best-selling book &ldquo;The Blind Side&rdquo; by Michael Lewis, has taken an insane turn over the past week. Oher has filed a lawsuit against the Tuohy family, claiming they never officially adopted him and accusing them of financial misdeeds related to movie profits. Now, author Lewis has defended the Tuohys and pointed fingers at Hollywood&rsquo;s accounting system as the real culprit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In 2006, Lewis&rsquo;s book spotlighted Oher&rsquo;s heartwarming journey from a troubled youth to an accomplished football player, largely credited to the benevolence and support of Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy. The narrative was later adapted into an award-winning movie in 2009, starring Sandra Bullock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, the harmony of the feel-good story depicted on the big screen seems drastically different from the current situation we&rsquo;re seeing unfold now. Oher&rsquo;s lawsuit alleges that the Tuohys tricked him into signing over the legal authority to use his name in business deals after his 18th birthday, thereby cheating him out of future proceeds. He asserts they profited off the Oscar-winning movie while sidelining him financially.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Responding to these allegations, the Tuohy family labeled Oher&rsquo;s claims a &ldquo;shameful shakedown&rdquo; and voiced intentions to end the conservatorship, a legal concept where an individual is appointed to manage another&rsquo;s financial and/or personal affairs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Adding fuel to the fire, the Tuohy family&rsquo;s attorney, Martin Singer, claims that before initiating the lawsuit, Oher tried to extort the family for $15 million. Singer alleged Oher threatened the Tuohys with negative press unless the hefty amount was handed over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But Michael Lewis, in interviews with both The Washington Post and at a previously recorded Google event, blames Tinsel Town for the mess. Lewis slammed Hollywood studios (the film was produced and distributed by Warner Bros.) for their accounting practices which, according to him, often shortchange those whose real-life stories inspire box office hits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">I &ldquo;Everybody should be mad at the Hollywood studio system,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;Michael Oher should join the writers strike. It&rsquo;s outrageous how Hollywood accounting works, but the money is not in the Tuohys&rsquo; pockets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Lewis further divulged that both he and the Tuohy family made about $350,000 each from the movie after considering taxes and agent fees. Challenging Oher&rsquo;s narrative, Lewis asserted that the Tuohys intended to share movie royalties among family members, including Oher. However, Oher reportedly began declining these royalty checks. In a move showcasing the Tuohy&rsquo;s good faith, Lewis revealed they deposited Oher&rsquo;s share in a trust fund designed for Oher&rsquo;s son.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2023/08/21/photos-hurricane-hilary-flooding-ravages-southern-california/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2023/08/21/photos-hurricane-hilary-flooding-ravages-southern-california/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hurricane Hilary Flooding Ravages Southern California</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tropical Storm Hilary deluged arid parts of Mexico and then drenched Southern California from the coast to the desert resort city of Palm Springs and inland mountains, forcing rescuers to pull several people from swollen rivers. Even as the storm subsides across the coast, flooding and mudslides were expected across the parts of the southwestern U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The storm first made landfall in Mexico&rsquo;s arid Baja California Peninsula on Sunday in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles (250 kilometers) south of Ensenada. One person drowned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It then moved through mudslide-prone Tijuana, threatening the improvised homes that cling to hillsides just south of the U.S. border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, Hilary dropped more than half an average year&rsquo;s worth of rain on some areas, including Palm Springs, which saw nearly 3.18 inches (8 centimeters) of rain by Sunday evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The National Hurricane Center in Miami downgraded Hilary to a post-tropical storm in its early Monday advisory, and warned that &ldquo;continued life-threatening and locally catastrophic flooding&rdquo; was expected over portions of the southwestern U.S. on Monday. All coastal warnings were discontinued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Forecasters warned of dangerous flash floods across Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, and fire officials rescued 13 people from knee-deep water in a homeless encampment along the rising San Diego River. Meanwhile, rain and debris washed out some roadways and people left their cars stranded in standing water. Crews pumped floodwaters out of the emergency room at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sunday was the wettest day on record in San Diego, with 1.82 inches (4.6 centimeters), the National Weather Service said in a post on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The previous record was on Aug. 17, 1977, when 1.8 inches (4.5 centimeters) post-Hurricane Doreen dumped record rainfall on the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation&rsquo;s second largest school system, said all campuses would be closed on Monday, as did districts across the region. San Diego schools postponed the first day of classes from Monday to Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Palm Springs Police Department said in a statement Sunday that 911 lines were down and that in the event of an emergency to text 911 or reach out to the nearest police or fire station.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The storm was projected to weaken as it continued moving northward over California and into Nevada, but Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said &ldquo;very heavy&rdquo; rain and strong winds are still likely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1693454589591523411"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1693454589591523411</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Southern California got another surprise Sunday afternoon as an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 hit near Ojai, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was felt widely and was followed by smaller aftershocks. There were no immediate reports of major damage or injury, according to a dispatcher with the Ventura County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hilary is just the latest major climate disaster to wreak havoc across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Hawaii&rsquo;s island of Maui is still reeling from a blaze that killed over 100 people and ravaged the historic town of Lahaina, making it the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. Firefighters in Canada are battling that nation&rsquo;s worst fire season on record.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As Hilary bore down on Mexico, one person drowned Saturday in Mugele, on the eastern side of the Baja Peninsula, when a vehicle was swept away by an overflowing stream. Rescue workers saved four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mexican army troops fanned out across the area where some of the worst damage occurred Saturday. Soldiers used bulldozers and dump trucks to help clear tons of boulders and earth that clogged streets and roads. Power lines were toppled in many places, and emergency personnel worked to restore electricity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Sunday morning in California, the warnings from officials didn&rsquo;t keep everyone indoors. In coastal Carlsbad, just north of San Diego, 19-year-old Jack Johnson and his friends kept an eye on the huge waves, determined to surf them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really choppy out there, not really surfable yet, but I think we can find a good break somewhere later,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember a storm like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also Sunday, one of several budding storm systems in the Atlantic Ocean became Tropical Storm Emily, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was far from land, moving west in the open ocean. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Franklin formed in the eastern Caribbean. Tropical storm watches were issued for the southern coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In September 1939, a tropical storm that roared into California ripped apart train tracks, tore houses from their foundations and capsized many boats, killing nearly 100 people on land and at sea</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/wef-adviser-population-collapse-is-good-for-the-planet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/wef-adviser-population-collapse-is-good-for-the-planet/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>WEF Advisor: Population Collapse is &ldquo;Good for the Planet&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Once a &ldquo;right-wing conspiracy,&rdquo; de-population is now being acknowledged by news outlets like The Telegraph.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Prof Harper told the Telegraph:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a good thing that the high-income, high-consuming countries of the world are reducing the number of children that they&rsquo;re having. I&rsquo;m quite positive about that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The WEF professor said declining fertility would help to address the &ldquo;general overconsumption that we have at the moment,&rdquo; which she claims has a negative impact on the planet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The WEF advisor also points out that a population collapse as a result in declines in births will bring about reductions in CO2 emissions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to research, wealthy nations tend to have much larger carbon footprints than poorer countries because they can buy more goods, travel, and do other activities that generate emissions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">World Bank figures show that carbon emissions from high-income countries were 29 times larger than low-income countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In June, U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry declared that 10 billion humans on the planet is &ldquo;unsustainable.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The global population hit eight billion people in November 2022, three times the figure recorded in 1950.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to U.N. projections, the current figure is set to hit 9.7 billion humans on the planet by the middle of the century.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, John Kerry expressed fears about the current population growth, outlining his plans to the AFP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sustainable, personally,&rdquo; Kerry said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We need to figure out how we&rsquo;re going to deal with the issue of sustainability and the numbers of people we&rsquo;re trying to take care of on the planet,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-renew-push-americans-get-covid-19-boosters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-renew-push-americans-get-covid-19-boosters</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden admin to renew push for Americans to get COVID-19 boosters</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Biden's administration is preparing another program to encourage Americans to get booster shots for COVID-19 in the coming months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported an increase in COVID-19 infections across the U.S., though it remains far below levels seen during the pandemic. The Biden administration plans to urge Americans to get booster shots this fall, an administration official told FOX Business' Edward Lawrence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We will be encouraging all Americans to get those boosters in addition to flu shots and RSV shots," the official said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The news comes days after the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) revealed they are tracking another variant of the virus that causes COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The newly discovered variant, referred to as BA.2.86, has been designated as a "variant under monitoring" by the WHO "due to the large number of mutations it carries."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The variant is one of dozens being tracked by national health agencies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The new booster program would come nearly a year after Biden declared the COVID-19 pandemic "over" in September 2022, though he said, "We're still doing a lot of work on it."</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Friday, August 18th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/mayor-blindsided-after-entire-police-force-resigns-in-minnesota-town"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/mayor-blindsided-after-entire-police-force-resigns-in-minnesota-town</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Mayor &lsquo;Blindsided&rsquo; After Entire Police Force Resigns In Minnesota Town</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Every police officer, including the chief of police, has stepped down from the force in a Minnesota town after they say complaints of low pay and long hours were left unresolved.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Goodhue, a city about 65 miles southeast of Minneapolis with just over 1,000 residents, could be without police officers by August 23. It has struggled to attract new police recruits and give competitive pay to officers. The nonpartisan mayor said she was &ldquo;blindsided&rdquo; by the resignations and promised that the city would be protected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I want to reiterate that we will have police coverage in the city of Goodhue,&rdquo; Mayor Ellen Anderson Buck told Fox 9. &ldquo;That is not an issue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police Chief Josh Smith said the force had trouble getting anyone interested in police work. Smith, another full-time employee, and five part-time employees all announced their resignations last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This has been three weeks now, we have zero applicants, and I have zero prospects,&rdquo; Smith said in July. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve called every PD around for the youngest guys out there, getting into the game. There&rsquo;s nobody getting into the game.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m leaving you guys, because I told you I&rsquo;m in it,&rdquo; he said at a meeting on July 26. &ldquo;But the harsh reality is, I don&rsquo;t want to be the guy working 80 hours a week just running this PD, being on call 24 hours a day, which I already am, and leaving no time for my family.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the Goodhue City Council raised Smith&rsquo;s salary by $13,000 and the other officers by 5% this year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Right now &hellip; trying to hire at $22 an hour, you&rsquo;re never going to see another person again walk through those doors,&rdquo; Smith said, noting that cities could frequently give more benefits and higher pay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After all the officers leave, the town is set to contract with the Goodhue County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to provide law enforcement services. The police department in Morris, another Minnesota town, was disbanded last year after it could not retain staffers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police departments across the U.S. have struggled to attract recruits in urban and rural areas. The shortage of officers comes following a wave of anti-police sentiment after the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody in 2020.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2023/08/16/pakistan-muslim-mob-of-10000-people-burns-down-hundreds-of-christian-homes-churches-over-blasphemy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2023/08/16/pakistan-muslim-mob-of-10000-people-burns-down-hundreds-of-christian-homes-churches-over-blasphemy/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Muslim Mob of 10,000 People Burns Down Hundreds of Christian Homes, Churches, over &lsquo;Blasphemy&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A mob reportedly made of up as many as 10,000 men began burning down, looting, and otherwise violently assaulting Christian communities in Jaranwala, Pakistan, on Wednesday in response to reports that a Christian man had allegedly desecrated a Quran.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Pakistani newspaper Dawn, citing local Christians in the northern Pakistani region of Punjab, documented the burning down or otherwise complete destruction of at least five churches. The British Asian Christian Association, an international aid group that serves persecuted Christians in Pakistan, reported that the mob destroyed over 500 homes and left &ldquo;tens of thousands&rdquo; of Christians homeless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Muslim mob violence in Pakistan, an officially Islamic state, is common. Islamist mobs often riot when rumors spread of a Christian allegedly desecrating a Quran, insulting the Islamic figure Muhammad, or otherwise offending the religion. Islamists have also rioted over international news, such as riots in support of the Charlie Hebdo massacre of 2015 or riots against France following the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, which the French government condemned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Christians are often the targets of such violence and local police rarely intervene effectively, particularly when the mob attacks are triggered by allegations of blasphemy. &ldquo;Blasphemy&rdquo; is a crime in the Pakistani penal code, punishable by death when directed at Muhammad personally. Pakistan has never in its history executed a person for blasphemy, but mobs have &ldquo;extra-judicially&rdquo; killed or severely injured untold numbers over the alleged crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Many of those killed for &ldquo;blasphemy&rdquo; are not charged with the crime and little evidence exists that the blasphemy occurred. Christians in Pakistan are disproportionately poor and some accused of &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; such as writing on a Quran are illiterate, making the accusations impossible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The incidents triggered on Wednesday reportedly began when Muslims in Jaranwala began accusing Saleem Masih, a Christian man believed to work as a cleaner, of desecrating a copy of the Quran, the Islamic holy book. According to the British Asian Christian Association, the violence began when Islamic officials used mosques to make community announcements demanding that mobs organize and begin destroying Christian communities in response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The affected regions, including Cinema Basti, Christian Town, and Esa Nagar, have witnessed the destruction of over 500 houses,&rdquo; the organization detailed. &ldquo;According to reports provided by on-ground volunteers, Pastors Muratib and Moon, a tumultuous mob of approximately 10,000 individuals has wreaked havoc within the Christian towns.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that pastors had confirmed the burning down and looting of at least five churches in the community throughout Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Images on social media showed smoke rising from the church buildings and people setting fire to furniture that had been dragged from them. A Christian cemetery was also vandalised, as well as the local government office,&rdquo; Dawn documented.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Videos from the greater fay-sala-bad area showed large crowds of men starting fires around churches, looting the homes of Christians, and chanting anti-Christian slogans. In one such video, one police officer appears in front of a crowd of what appears to be hundreds of people, calmly attempting to address the men and being ignored as they continue ransacking what appears to be a residential community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bishop Azad Marshall, the president bishop of the Church of Pakistan, posted a message on Twitter on Wednesday stating that churches were burning as he was writing and demanding police take action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The mob attacks appear to be ongoing at press time, though local police claim they are organizing a response. Pakistan&rsquo;s Geo TV cited the information minister for Punjab, Amir Mir, claiming &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of people had been arrested for their participation in the mob attacks and that police believed the eruption of violence was not spontaneous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;There was a plan to disturb the peace by inciting public sentiments. After the desecration of the Holy Quran, the angry protesters reacted strongly,&rdquo; Mir claimed, apparently accepting the alleged blasphemy as a fact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Geo TV added that Mir claimed police were working swiftly to investigate &ldquo;the tragic incident of the desecration of the holy book&rdquo; &ndash; the Quran, presumably, though Mir did not clarify if he was also investigating Bishop Marshall&rsquo;s report of desecrations of Bibles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mir also astoundingly claimed &ldquo;no one was injured nor was there any loss of life&rdquo; in the riots, contradicting the on-the-ground reports from the British Asian Christian Association, which alleged thousands of injuries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>North Carolina legislature overrides Governor&rsquo;s vetoes on transgender and charter school bills</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The North Carolina House of Representatives and Senate voted along party lines to override several of Governor Roy Cooper&rsquo;s vetoes on Wednesday afternoon. All of the bills that had their vetoes overridden now become law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House and Senate members first voted to override House Bill 574, which is better known as the Fairness in Women&rsquo;s Sports Act. The bill would ban all transgender girls and women (biological boys or men) from competing in women&rsquo;s athletics at the middle school, high school, and college levels in North Carolina. After passing the House, the Senate then overrode the governor&rsquo;s veto as well along party lines..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also on the calendar Wednesday was House Bill 808, a bill that would ban gender-affirming care for children. This bill prohibits doctors in North Carolina from treating any child under 18 years old with drugs associated with gender transitioning. The House overrode the Governor&rsquo;s veto of that bill by a vote of 73-46. The NC Senate then voted to override the veto by a vote of 27-18.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Senate Bill 49, also known as the Parents Bill of Rights or also by the nickname &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Say Gay bill&rdquo; is a bill that would force educators from kindergarten through high school to notify parents if a child asked school personnel to use other pronouns or other names for them. Senate Bill 49&prime;s veto was also overridden in both chambers of the General Assembly Wednesday as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The House and Senate also voted to override House Bill 219, known as the Charter School Omnibus Bill, by a House vote of 74-45 and a Senate vote of 27-18.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Bill 219 allows charter schools in the state to expand without seeking permission as long as they&rsquo;re not considered low-performing. It would also allow them to give preferential treatment to applicants instead of using the lottery system as well as begin to allow enrollment and charge tuition for out-of-state and foreign exchange students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Bill 219 would also allow county governments to use funds collected from property taxes to pay for charter school buildings and other capital projects, under current law using public funds for this reason is not possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both chambers also voted along party lines to override Governor Cooper&rsquo;s veto of HB618 dealing with charter school review boards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Bill 488, a bill allowing for Code Council Reorganization and various code amendments was also overridden in both chambers on Wednesday along party lines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Upon adjournment, House Speaker Tim Moore (R - Cleveland County) told members that there would be no legislative votes for the rest of this week or next, and possibly the week beyond that, meaning that the General Assembly will not be taking up a state budget until at least September, well after the start of the new year for North Carolina&rsquo;s public schools.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Tuohy Family From &lsquo;The Blind Side&rsquo; Responds To Accusations From NFL Vet Michael Oher As He Seeks Film Royalties</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former NFL player Michael Oher, who was the focus of the 2009 blockbuster film The Blind Side, has filed a lawsuit in a Shelby County, Tennessee court against Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy, the people who took him into their home and raised him as a wayward teenager. Oher accuses them of misleading him intentionally regarding his &lsquo;adoption,&rsquo; which he claims was a conservatorship instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Needless to say, this revelation has completely altered the images of Oher and the Tuohy&rsquo;s portrayed in the popular film, suggesting that this Christian, kind family may have had other motives for taking Oher into their home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Oher, now 37 years old, had his attorney file a 14-page document to the court alleging that as a teenager, the Tuohy&rsquo;s convinced him to sign a document back in 2004 giving them full legal authority over any business decisions he could potentially be involved in, rather than what he believed was an adoption by the family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sean Tuohy said in an interview with The Daily Memphis that the accusations of ill-intent and that his family simply wanted to profit off of Oher were ridiculous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I sat Michael down and told him, &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re planning to go to Ole Miss &mdash; or even considering Ole Miss &mdash; we think you have to be part of the family. This would do that legally,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said at the time when Oher believed they were legally adopting him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We contacted lawyers who had told us that we couldn&rsquo;t adopt over the age of 18; the only thing we could do was to have a conservatorship. We were so concerned it was on the up-and-up that we made sure the biological mother came to court.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tuohy also stated that the family did not earn the sizable amount of money Oher&rsquo;s attorneys believe they did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Touhy, who is already wealthy himself from owning and selling a chain of fast food franchises for upwards of $200 million, claimed that those saying it was all about the money should think again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1691179803821359105"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1691179803821359105</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The lawsuit being brought by Oher, paints a vastly different picture&hellip; if you want more information on that lawsuit, go listen to my newsbrief from yesterday.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>
