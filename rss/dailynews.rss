<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nashville police find trans school shooter's suicide note&mdash;refuse to release details</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department reportedly found a suicide note left by trans-identifying school shooter Audrey Hale during their search of the now deceased assailant's home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While authorities have confirmed that the note exists, its contents have not disclosed what it contains.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to NBC News, on Tuesday authorities released a list of items discovered at the home following the shooting. Among them were several journals, a shotgun, cellphones, laptops, and a suicide note. Old photos and yearbooks from The Covenant School, where Hale was a former student, were also recovered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MNPD declined to provide further details regarding the contents of the note, a document which many have suggested could shine some light on the potential motive behind the mass shooting, which left six people dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers did reveal, however, that many of the othe documents they found included notes about firearms courses and school shootings of the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, police revealed that Hale planned the attack "over a period of months," and that she fired 152 rounds from the time she shot her way into the school until being killed by police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The writings remain under careful review by the MNPD and the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit based in Quantico, Virginia. The motive for Hale&rsquo;s actions has not been established and remains under investigation by the Homicide Unit in consultation with the FBI&rsquo;s Behavioral Analysis Unit," MNPD wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale's manifesto has also been recovered, and its contents will reportedly be released to the public as soon as the FBI has analyzed it.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Another Biden Administration COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate Struck Down by Court</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration did not have the authority to impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on workers and volunteers in a federal childcare program, a U.S. judge has ruled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) forced Head Start workers, and some volunteers, to get a COVID-19 vaccine starting in early 2022. Head Start provides childcare to children from low-income families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HHS cited the Head Start Act, which says the health secretary can add &ldquo;administrative and financial management standards,&rdquo; &ldquo;standards relating to the condition and location of facilities (including indoor air quality assessment standards, where appropriate),&rdquo; and &ldquo;such other standards as the secretary finds to be appropriate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that the mandate was outside of the power granted by the act. The law &ldquo;does not mention vaccinations,&rdquo; he and other plaintiffs said in a brief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix agreed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The wisdom of Head Start&rsquo;s rule is not before the Court&mdash;only its legality. If the people, through Congress, wish to impose a vaccine mandate on Head Start programs, they may do so by passing a law. But an agency can do only what Congress authorizes it to do,&rdquo; Hendrix, a Trump appointee, said in his ruling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Regardless of how well intentioned, HHS&rsquo;s attempt here to shoehorn the vaccine mandate into statutory language authorizing modification of Head Start&rsquo;s administrative, financial, and facility-management standards goes too far. Equally fatal to the rule is the agency&rsquo;s decision to implement it without the necessary public notice and comment, consultation with stakeholders, and reasonable explanation,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling strikes down the mandate, which Biden&rsquo;s administration had refused to rescind. The mandate had already been struck down in 24 states, per a 2022 ruling by a different judge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HHS and the U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to announce that the Biden Administration&rsquo;s attempt to use the Head Start program to mask toddlers and force the vaccine on staff and volunteers has now been permanently defeated,&rdquo; Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican and one of the plaintiffs, said in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In court filings, defendants had urged the judge not to block the mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent transmission or infection, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though observational data have indicated they have a small effect on both that might turn negative over time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Head Start Association, a nonprofit, welcomed the judge&rsquo;s ruling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head Start previously rescinded its mask mandate after months of lobbying from the nonprofit and others. It had mandated masks for children, workers, and volunteers.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-reaches-ettlement-in-sutherland-springs-texas-shooting-civil-cases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-reaches-ettlement-in-sutherland-springs-texas-shooting-civil-cases/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DOJ agrees to $144M settlement in Sutherland Springs shooting civil cases alleging background check negligence</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department announced Wednesday it has reached a $144 million agreement in principle to settle civil cases stemming from a 2017 mass shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, which left 26 dead.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said the settlements will resolve claims from more than 75 plaintiffs, who alleged "the Air Force was negligent when it failed to transmit to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System information about the shooter that would have prevented him from purchasing guns from a federally licensed firearms dealer."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gunman in the November 2017 attack, Devin Patrick Kelly, served in the Air Force. He died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"No words or amount of money can diminish the immense tragedy of the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs," said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. "Today&rsquo;s announcement brings the litigation to a close, ending a painful chapter for the victims of this unthinkable crime."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department said Wednesday that a "federal district court in Texas concluded that the United States was liable for damages caused by the shooting."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The agreement in principle would settle all claims for a total of $144.5 million. The settlement agreement has been approved, subject to the plaintiffs&rsquo; securing the required court approvals," it added. "Under applicable law, a court must approve some aspects of the settlements."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department also said the "NICS plays a critical role in combatting gun violence, and the federal government is always striving to improve the functioning of that system."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley had served nearly five years in the Air Force before being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct, after he was convicted of assaulting a former wife and stepson, cracking the child&rsquo;s skull. The Air Force has publicly acknowledged that the felony conviction for domestic violence, had it been put into the FBI database, could have prevented Kelley from buying guns from licensed firearms dealers, and also from possessing body armor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez said in 2021 that had the government done its job and entered Kelley&rsquo;s history into the database, "it is more likely than not that Kelley would have been deterred from carrying out the Church shooting."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley was shot at by two churchgoers who later pursued him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said an autopsy determined Kelley was shot by Willeford twice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this!!!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/04/03/city-council-considering-sale-of-biblical-roman-art-for-lack-of-diversity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/04/03/city-council-considering-sale-of-biblical-roman-art-for-lack-of-diversity/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>City Council Considering Sale of Biblical, Roman Art for &lsquo;Lack of Diversity&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acouncil in the English city of Oxford has announced that it will consider selling some of its Biblical art that decorates the town hall in an effort to &ldquo;better reflect the gender and ethnic diversity of [the] city&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, March 20th, a Liberal Democratic councillor, Katherine Miles, submitted a motion to the council to have the artworks either removed or sold. The two paintings she demands be removed or sold are the Rape of the Sabine Women and Salome and Head of John the Baptist. The former depicts Roman mythology, whereas the latter is a biblical tale.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Miles has been working on an initiative to increase the diversity and representation of the artwork in Oxford City Council since June 2021. She claims that the paintings depict &ldquo;animal cruelty and gender-based violence&rdquo;, as well as a lack of diversity. More specifically, she argues the artwork contains fox hunting, representations of death, and depictions of rape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with Oxford Mail, the newspaper that first reported the story, Ms. Miles reflected on the &ldquo;lack of diversity,&rdquo; stating, &ldquo;[with] only three portraits in the town hall of women, it is high time the council redresses the existing lack of diversity within the town hall portraits to better reflect the gender and ethnic diversity of our city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, in her words, the collection has &ldquo;no practical value to the city&rdquo; nor a &ldquo;clear link to Oxford&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Liberal Democrat councillor, Lawrence Fouweather, announced his support of the motion. He argues that the artwork could be sold to assist local residents in financial difficulties. &ldquo;The Council,&rdquo; he argues, &ldquo;is running short of cash, and at the same time the cost of living crisis is thrusting many of our residents into tremendous hardship and poverty&hellip;this proposed one-off sale of select artworks from the city&rsquo;s collection would help alleviate the dire plight of some of our most deprived residents&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Miles, on the other hand, has stated that &ldquo;[s]elling any existing artwork not on display, and not becoming of a public institution, may be [sic] one way to fund the costs of any initiative to improve the decorations in the town hall&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One critic, Peter Whittle of the New Culture Forum in London, criticized the move, stating, &ldquo;our culture continues to be dismantled by nobodies, morons and philistines&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No verdict has been made on the sale. A spokesman for Oxford City Council has publicly stated that, as for now, &ldquo;there is no council position on this matter&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Telegraph, &ldquo;[d]iscussions about the diversity of public art in Oxford come after the city council created an &ldquo;Anti-Racism Charter&rdquo; in 2021, after pledging to tackle discrimination following Black Lives Matter protests the previous year.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cash App founder Bob Lee fatally stabbed in San Francisco</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech executive Bob Lee, founder of Cash App and the former chief technology officer of Square, was stabbed to death in San Francisco, California, according to reports.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 43-year-old man was attacked Tuesday at around 2:35 a.m., San Francisco Police said in a statement. Officers arrived at the scene on the 300 block of Main Street in response to the stabbing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco medical examiner has not yet identified the victim, but Lee was later identified by his friends as the person stabbed, according to KPIX.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee was rushed to the hospital to receive treatment for his life-threatening wounds, but he later succumbed to his injuries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No arrests have been made in connection with the stabbing as of Wednesday morning. The incident remains under investigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee was the chief product officer of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency company MobileCoin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He previously worked at Google, where he led Android's core library team and launched "the world&rsquo;s most used operating system," his profile on MobileCoin&rsquo;s official website reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech mogul also founded the social network Present, and invested in and advised other companies, including Figma, Clubhouse, Beeper and Faire.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the coronavirus pandemic, Lee helped the World Health Organization with their mobile app and led development for an at-home testing company.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-could-sentenced-more-100-years-prison-1792487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-could-sentenced-more-100-years-prison-1792487</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Donald Trump Could be Sentenced to More Than 100 Years in Prison</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Donald Trump could be sentenced to more than 100 years in prison if found guilty of the over 30 charges of business fraud in the indictment from a Manhattan grand jury for which he'll be arraigned on Tuesday in New York, according to attorney Lisa Bloom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to an exclusive report by Yahoo News correspondent Michael Isikoff on Monday, the former president will face 34 class E felonies for falsification of business records in the case which revolves around the $130,000 payment of hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels by Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing and called the probe a political "witch hunt."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"If this report is correct, Trump will be arraigned tomorrow on 34 FELONIES. Each carries a possible prison term of 4 years. Bragg would not bring this case without strong evidence," she wrote about the Manhattan District Attorney leading the grand jury investigation, Alvin Bragg.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Remember, this is the same DA's office that recently convicted the Trump Org for criminal fraud."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bloom, who since 2015 has been a vocal critic of Trump and in 2016 represented pro-bono four women accusing him of sexual harassment or sexual assault, said she's convinced that the case against Trump is strong, going to the point of calling it "a prosecutor's dream" because there's a record of the former president giving conflicting versions of the story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Based on these premises, Bloom expects the 34 felony charges to be about Trump's attempts to "cover up evidence of an underlying crime, in this case the campaign nondisclosures."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Most experts looking at the case against Trump expect the chance of Trump actually serving prison time if found guilty close to zero. The charges against him would also not disqualify him from running for the presidency in 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It's also uncertain whether Bragg would actually recommend Trump serve time in prison. The sentence will be eventually decided by the judge.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Job openings tumbled below 10 million in February for the first time in nearly two years</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Job openings fell below 10 million in February for the first time in nearly two years, in a sign that the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s efforts to slow the labor market may be having some impact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Available positions totaled 9.93 million, a drop of 632,000 from January&rsquo;s downwardly revised number, the Labor Department reported Tuesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Wall Street had been looking for 10.4 million, according to FactSet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It was the first time vacancies fell below 10 million since May 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Fed has targeted the red-hot labor market in its quest to bring down inflation, which had been running at a 41-year high in the summer of 2022. The central bank has raised benchmark interest rates nine times since March 2022, but those moves had been appearing to have little impact on the jobs situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Prior to the February data, job openings had been outnumbering available workers by nearly 2 to 1. The latest figures bring that ratio down to less than 1.7 to 1.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Treasury yields fell following the release as the data could help dissuade the Fed from further rate hikes. Stocks moved lower.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The labor market is starting to loosen as the number of job openings declined in most sectors. As the economy slows, firms will likely cut openings and workers will be less likely to quit in search of better hours and higher pay,&rdquo; said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. &ldquo;The Fed could consider pausing rate hikes at the next meeting but only if the upcoming employment report shows signs of material weakness and the March [consumer price index] report reveals lower inflation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Though the numbers run a month behind, the Fed watches the JOLTS data closely for signs of labor slack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Along with the decline in job openings, hires and separations also decreased slightly. Quits, a sign of labor confidence in the ability to switch jobs, rose by 146,000 to just over 4 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Professional and business services saw a slide of 278,000 job openings on the month, while trade, transportation and utilities decreased 210,000. Accommodation and food services, an important sector to gauge consumer demand, dropped 125,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On the positive side, there were 129,000 new construction jobs available, though that was the only category that saw a noticeable bump.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The JOLTS release comes three days ahead of fresh nonfarm payroll numbers for March. The Friday Labor Department count is expected to show a gain of 238,000, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.6%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/wisconsin-voters-head-to-the-polls-to-decide-balance-of-state-supreme-court"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/wisconsin-voters-head-to-the-polls-to-decide-balance-of-state-supreme-court</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Wisconsin Voters Head To The Polls To Decide Balance Of State Supreme Court</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Voters in Wisconsin head to the polls on Tuesday to decide the balance of the state Supreme Court in one of the most expensive court races in history.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Neither candidate running for the open seat belongs to a political party. Conservative candidate and former Justice Dan Kelly, backed by most Republicans, is facing off against liberal candidate Judge Janet Protasiewicz (Pro-Tuh-Say-Witz), the preferred candidate of most Democrats, with the winner determining the ideological slant of the divided court and earning a 10-year term on the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Protasiewicz has reportedly been backed by donations from left-wing billionaire George Soros and Gov. J.B Pritzker (D-IL), while Kelly has received support from groups like Fair Courts America, a conservative judicial organization. Total spending has exceeded $40 million, an astronomical amount compared to previous years when total spending was only around $10 million.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hollywood has even thrown its weight behind Protasiewicz, with director Steven Speilberg contributing to her campaign and actor Mark Ruffalo encouraging voters to &ldquo;change the future of Wisconsin by electing Janet Protasiewicz &amp; flipping the state supreme court.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both candidates have suggested that the other is unfit to serve, with Kelly pointing to Protasiewicz&rsquo;s left-wing ties and claiming she has a soft-on-crime sentencing history, while Protasiewicz linked Kelly to attempts to challenge the 2020 presidential election in the Badger State.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During a debate earlier this year, Protasiewicz claimed that she was &ldquo;running against probably one of the most extreme partisan characters in the history of the state.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Though officially non-partisan, the candidates have nearly polar opposite views, with Protasiewicz openly championing her support for abortion and Kelly receiving the endorsements of key pro-life groups in the state. Protasiewicz had an ad featuring a woman celebrating an abortion because the child could have been born with disabilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The election could be a deciding factor in a case over Wisconsin&rsquo;s 1849 abortion ban, which became relevant after Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The candidates could also play a key role in deciding the fate of other laws in the state, including election integrity measures, election maps, and gun laws. Last year, the state made a bombshell ruling, saying that Wisconsin voters could not turn their ballots into unmanned drop boxes and that voters would not be allowed to give them to others to drop off for them. This case, decided 4-3, would likely have been different with a different balance on the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Republicans currently control the state&rsquo;s general assembly, but Democrat Gov. Tony Evers won re-election in November, meaning lawmakers are limited in what laws they can get passed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/los-angeles-decarceration-release-inmates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/los-angeles-decarceration-release-inmates</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Los Angeles floats 'decarceration' policy to release large number of inmates</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is floating a "decarceration" policy that would drastically reduce the number of people in jails, releasing many current inmates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The agenda item , added to Tuesday's meeting, is titled "Los Angeles County to Take Actionable Next Steps to Depopulate and Decarcerate the Los Angeles County Jails: Granting Local Authority, Advocating for Court and State Support, and Legislative Changes."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The proposal, to be discussed during the meeting, would "declare the State of mental health services and overcrowding in the Los Angeles County jails a humanitarian crisis, requiring the County to move with all deliberate speed on meaningful solutions; and prioritize decreasing the number of individuals entering the Los Angeles County Jails" through a number of measures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In order to "reaffirm the Board&rsquo;s commitment to depopulate and decarcerate," the proposal would require law enforcement to "cite and release individuals with aggregate bail amounts set at $50,000 or below" and "adopt a zero-bail schedule for individuals accused of low-level offenses, infractions, misdemeanors, and some felony offenses."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The push comes as crime, including violent crime, has risen in the past few years, particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic . An analysis found that crime increased 11% in 2022, with 60 reported crimes per 1,000 residents, compared to 2021, which saw 54 crimes per 1,000 residents. In some areas, crime has skyrocketed; downtown experienced 372 crimes per 1,000 residents in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The vice president of the Los Angeles Association of Deputy District Attorneys, Eric Siddall, denounced the proposal, speaking with Fox News, arguing that it would make crime in the city even worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors&rsquo; motion to gut parts of the criminal justice system without input from stakeholders is dangerous and recklessness," he told the outlet. "The authors sought no advice from those who know and understand public safety issues. They seek to lower the jail population without addressing the root causes of crime or protecting the public."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He condemned the "catch-and-release" part of the proposal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now this!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/gone-with-the-wind-to-include-trigger-warning-intro-that-addresses-white-supremacy-in-latest-print"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/gone-with-the-wind-to-include-trigger-warning-intro-that-addresses-white-supremacy-in-latest-print</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>'Gone with the Wind' to include trigger warning, intro that addresses 'white supremacy' in latest print</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The publishers of the classic American novel "Gone with the Wind" will include a "harmful" trigger warning and an introduction that addresses "white supremacy," the Telegraph reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Pan Macmillan, a publishing house based in London, has decided to affix a trigger warning to Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel. The book, which takes place in 1861, follows the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the daughter of a southern plantation owner, and her romance with Captain Rhett Butler during the Civil War.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The cautionary note at the front of the new edition of the book will warn readers that it contains "racist" themes that could be "hurtful or indeed harmful."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Gone with the Wind is a novel which includes problematic elements including the romanticisation of a shocking era in our history and the horrors of slavery," the trigger warning states. "The novel includes the representation of unacceptable practices, racist and stereotypical depictions and troubling themes, characterisation, language and imagery."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Pan Macmillan noted that the new edition of Mitchell's novel would remain original. New editions of works from Agatha Christie and Ian Fleming were recently altered to remove potentially offensive passages with racial references.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The text of this book remains true to the original in every way and is reflective of the language and period in which it was originally written," the cautionary note continued. "We want to alert readers that there may be hurtful or indeed harmful phrases and terminology that were prevalent at the time this novel was written and which are true to the context of the historical setting of this novel."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Pan Macmillan believes changing the text to reflect today&rsquo;s world would undermine the authenticity of the original, so has chosen to leave the text in its entirety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Pan Macmillan added, "This does not, however, constitute an endorsement of the characterisation, content or language used."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The cautionary note affixed to the start of the novel was written by Philippa Gregory, the author of "The Other Boleyn Girl." According to the publisher, Gregory was chosen to pen the introduction because "we believed it was important that no author from a minority background should be asked to undertake the emotional labour of being responsible for educating the majority."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Gregory argued that Mitchell's novel "effectively promoted the racist planter view of the history of the South." She claimed it "defends racism" and "glamorizes and preaches white supremacy."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to Gregory, "It tells us, unequivocally, that African people are not of the same species as white people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"This is the lie that spoils the novel," Gregory adds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">All I can say to the publisher is, Frankly my dear&hellip; I don&rsquo;t give a damn.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trump Indicted Over $130,000 Hush Money Payment To Stormy Daniels</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former President Donald Trump, already under multiple criminal investigations for his coup attempt, has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury for his role in a $130,000 hush money payment to a porn star in the days before the 2016 election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The New York Times was the first to report on the still-sealed indictment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trump&rsquo;s campaign staff did not immediately respond to a HuffPost query Thursday. But Taylor Budowich, a former Trump aide and now the head of a pro-Trump super PAC, claimed in a Twitter post that the indictment is evidence of a &ldquo;failed nation,&rdquo; and predicted it would actually help Trump.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trump, who is running again for the Republican nomination for the presidency, has in recent days ramped up his appeals to supporters to rise up against prosecutors in New York and elsewhere ― reminiscent of his inflammatory language leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his followers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In another post, Trump predicted he would be arrested on Tuesday, March 21, forcing New York City police to increase security at the courthouse. Then, when no indictment came, Trump and others suggested that District Attorney Alvin Bragg must have backed down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As of late Thursday afternoon, Trump had not posted anything following the news of the indictment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The indictment in New York City gives Trump, who frequently claimed that his actions as president were &ldquo;historic,&rdquo; another claim to history: He is now the first of the 44 ex-chief executives to be charged with a crime. He had previously entered the history books by becoming the only president to be impeached twice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">One of his lawyers at the time, Michael Cohen, already pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violating campaign finance laws with the check to Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about the affair she says she had with Trump in 2006. Cohen served 13 months in prison and another year and a half under home confinement for that and various unrelated charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Cohen is likely to be a key witness against Trump in District Attorney Alvin Bragg&rsquo;s prosecution. He has said Trump reimbursed him for the $130,000, as well as $150,000 to a second woman, with a series of payments, and evidence during his case showed the money came from Trump&rsquo;s business as a supposed &ldquo;legal expense.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trump has claimed that Bragg&rsquo;s probe is a part of a &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; against him</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The former president is also under investigation by the Fulton County District Attorney in Atlanta and the U.S. Department of Justice about his attempts to overturn the 2020 election he lost by pressuring his own vice president into throwing out the results from key states and awarding Trump a second term ― an effort that culminated in the violence he incited on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/far-left-activists-students-storm-state-house-to-demanding-more-gun-control-in-tennessee?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/far-left-activists-students-storm-state-house-to-demanding-more-gun-control-in-tennessee?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Far-left activists, students storm state house to demand more gun control in Tennessee</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Thursday, a large number of individuals congregated at the Tennessee State Capitol, with the situation quickly turning chaotic as leftist activists entered the building and were seen shouting at lawmakers, demanding more gun control measures.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Among those present were parents with their children and members of the community demonstrating following the Covenant School shooting, which resulted in the deaths of six individuals, including three children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We&rsquo;re here because we still believe that we can make change. We can. It&rsquo;s a tough state, I get it,&rdquo; said organizer Maryam Abolfazli, to local news outlet WKRN.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Republican-majority Legislature gathered at the Capitol on Thursday to start the legislative session for the first time since the shooting. Protestors stormed the building and filled the hallways while chanting slogans.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Demonstrators took over both indoor and outdoor spaces, video shows.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Senate chamber gallery was filled with protesters, including children holding signs with the age of the victims of the recent attack.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Some of the protestors interrupted the lawmakers with their shouts of "Children are dead!" resulting in their removal from the gallery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile, in the House, two Democratic lawmakers caused a temporary disruption by using a megaphone to yell, "Power to the people."</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The protests followed a candlelight vigil held in Nashville the previous night, where Republican lawmakers, alongside First Lady Jill Biden, Democratic lawmakers, and musicians, including Sheryl Crow, gathered to honor the victims and advocate for stricter gun control.</span></p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A caravan of more than 1,000 migrants crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, Wednesday as chaos erupted in recent days on the Mexican side in Juarez.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Agents apprehended the group, which was mostly comprised of Venezuelans, Wednesday, El Paso Border Patrol Chief Anthony Good said late Thursday. The incident follows chaos in Juarez, where nearly 40 migrants died Monday in a shelter fire.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hundreds of migrants also amassed at the Paso del Norte bridge on March 15 leading into Juarez to demand entry into the U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Venezuelans are expelled under Title 42, a public health order invoked by the Trump administration during COVID-19. They are, however, offered exemptions through a humanitarian parole program and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) One, a phone app used to request an entry interview.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Migrants have expressed frustrations with the CBP One process having glitches and lacking appointment availability.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Migrants that are still arriving at the southern border from the original surge invitation by the president are becoming impatient with extended processing times and turning frustrations against CBP personnel,&rdquo; a Border Patrol agent, who requested anonymity because they weren&rsquo;t authorized to speak publicly, recently told the Daily Caller News Foundation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Blue flight: Los Angeles, Cook counties post biggest population losses in U.S. in 2022</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The number of people who used to live in Los Angeles County and Cook County in Illinois continues to plummet.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Los Angeles County posted the largest population decline of all counties in the United States in 2022, falling by 90,704 and continuing a downward trend. It lost nearly twice that amount (180,394) in 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Vintage 2022 estimates released Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Cook County, home to Chicago, lost 68,314 people from July 2021 to July of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Los Angeles County was still the most populous county in the U.S. That was followed by Cook County in Illinois at 5,109,292, which declined by 68,314 from the prior year. Rounding out the top five were Harris County, Texas (4,780,913); Maricopa County, Arizona (4,551,524); and San Diego County, California (3,276,208).</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Eight of the top 10 most populous counties in the U.S. were located in the South and West. The two exceptions were Cook County in Illinois and Kings County in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Reflecting longstanding regional population shifts, the nation&rsquo;s most populous counties are increasingly located in the South and West," the bureau reported. "In 2022, 63 of the country&rsquo;s 100 most populous counties were located in the South and West, up from 61 in the prior year."</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The 10 counties in the U.S. that gained the most people were located in three states: Texas, Arizona and Florida. Maricopa County in Arizona topped the growth list, adding 56,831 people in 2022. It was followed by Harris County, Texas (added 45,626); Collin County, Texas (44,246); Denton County, Texas (33,424); and Polk County, Florida (32,225).</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The biggest losers were Los Angeles County, California (-90,704); Cook County, Illinois (-68,314); Queens County, New York (-50,112); Kings County, New York (-46,970); and Bronx County, New York (-41,143).</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The migration and growth patterns for counties edged closer to pre-pandemic levels this year," said Christine Hartley, assistant division chief for estimates and projections in the Census Bureau&rsquo;s population division. "Some urban counties, such as Dallas and San Francisco, saw domestic outmigration at a slower pace between 2021 and 2022, compared to the prior year."</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Deaths outnumbered births in most U.S. counties in 2022. Nearly three-quarters of all U.S. counties had natural decrease in 2022, which means they recorded more deaths than births.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The incidence of natural decrease remains historically high," the bureau reported. "Natural decrease counties are found nationwide but are especially prevalent in some states."</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Maine was the only state in the nation where all counties had natural decrease. Deaths outnumbered births in 54 or the 55 counties in West Virginia. And seven of the 10 counties with the highest amount of natural decrease were in Florida. Pinellas County topped the list with -6,468.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Births exceeded deaths in 791 counties (or 25.2% of all counties) in 2022. Five of the top 10 counties where births exceeded deaths, called natural increase, were in Texas. Harris County had the highest in the nation with 30,117.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/dna-half-eaten-burrito-ties-wisconsin-doctoral-student-pro-life-center-firebombing-attack"><strong>https://www.foxnews.com/us/dna-half-eaten-burrito-ties-wisconsin-doctoral-student-pro-life-center-firebombing-attack</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DNA from half-eaten burrito ties ex-Wisconsin doctoral student to pro-life center firebombing attack</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA found in a half-eaten burrito helped exposed a former Wisconsin university research assistant now accused of firebombing a pro-life center last Mother's Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attack on the headquarters of Wisconsin Family Action in Madison, Wisconsin, came about a week after the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would later overturn Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 10 months after a Molotov cocktail was tossed inside the office and the message, "If abortions aren&rsquo;t safe then you aren&rsquo;t either," was scrawled on the building's side, Hridindu Sankar Roychowdhury, 29, of Madison, was arrested in Boston on Tuesday and charged with one count of attempting to cause damage by means of fire or an explosive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department said he traveled from Madison to Portland, Maine, and he purchased a one-way ticket from Boston to Guatemala City, Guatemala, departing Tuesday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement arrested Roychowdhury at Boston Logan International Airport.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"According to the complaint, Mr. Roychowdhury used an incendiary device in violation of federal law in connection with his efforts to terrorize and intimidate a private organization," Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department&rsquo;s National Security Division said in a statement. "I commend the commitment and professionalism of law enforcement personnel who worked exhaustively to ensure that justice is served."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Violence is never an acceptable way for anyone to express their views or their disagreement," Assistant Director Robert R. Wells of the FBI&rsquo;s Counterterrorism Division said. "Today&rsquo;s arrest demonstrates the FBI&rsquo;s commitment to vigorously pursue those responsible for this dangerous attack and others across the country, and to hold them accountable for their criminal actions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the complaint, on Mother&rsquo;s Day, Sunday, May 8, 2022, at approximately 6:06 a.m., law enforcement responded to an active fire at an office building located in Madison.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once inside the building, police observed a mason jar under a broken window. The jar was broken, and the lid and screw top were burned black, the Justice Department said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police also saw a purple disposable lighter near the mason jar. On the opposite wall from the window, the police saw another mason jar with the lid on and a blue cloth tucked into the top, and the cloth was singed. The jar was about half full of a clear fluid that smelled like an accelerant, the complaint says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the building, someone spray-painted on one wall, "If abortions aren&rsquo;t safe then you aren&rsquo;t either" and, on another wall, a large "A" with a circle around it and the number "1312," according to the Justice Department. During the investigation, law enforcement collected DNA from the scene of the attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2023, law enforcement identified Roychowdhury as a possible suspect. The affidavit said officers conducting surveillance on a protest at the Wisconsin State Capitol over the construction of an Atlanta public safety center dubbed "Cop City," observed an individual later identified as Roychowdhury.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local police officers later observed Roychowdhury dispose of food in a public trash can, and the officers recovered the leftover food and related items, and law enforcement collected DNA from the food. The affidavit says officers recovered a paper bag filled with "a quarter portion of a partially eaten burrito wrapped in waxed paper, a soiled napkin, a crumpled napkin, a stack of napkins, the wrapper of the burrito, a crumpled food wrapper, [and] four unopened hot sauce packets."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"On March 17, 2023, law enforcement advised that a forensic biologist examined the DNA evidence recovered from the attack scene and compared it to the DNA collected from the food contents. The forensic biologist found the two samples matched and likely were the same individual," the Justice Department said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Rep. Barbara Dittrich, a Republican, shared screenshots to Twitter Tuesday showing that the University of Wisconsin-Madison's website listed Roychowdhury as a trainee/research assistant for the Biophysics Interdisciplinary PhD in Structural and Computational Biology and Quantitative Biosciences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A LinkedIn profile for Roychowdhury also listed a UWMadison Doctor of Philosophy - PhD Biochemistry under education.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This man should be charged with domestic terrorism, and the good taxpayers of this state should not be paying his salary," Dittrich tweeted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an update, the lawmaker said UWMadison campus "notified us after this post that Mr. Roychowdhurdy ended his affiliation with the UW System the year that this incident occurred.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If convicted, Roychowdhury faces a mandatory minimum penalty of five years and a maximum of 20 years in prison, prosecutors said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In world news&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/03/28/former-general-calls-for-eu-military-in-north-africa-to-defeat-russian-mercenaries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/03/28/former-general-calls-for-eu-military-in-north-africa-to-defeat-russian-mercenaries/</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Former General Calls for EU Military in North Africa to Defeat Russian Mercenaries</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Italian General has called on the European Union to act militarily in Northern Africa, blaming the Russian mercenary PMC Wagner Group for the current wave of illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Carlo Jean, former commander of the Italian unit of the NATO Mobile Force and Alpine Brigade &ldquo;Cadore&rdquo;, is the latest Italian official to blame Private Military Company Wagner &mdash; Russian mercenaries, in other words &mdash; for the surge of illegals that have arrived in Italy so far this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to General Jean, local governments in African countries have become too weak in the face of ethnic and tribal groups making cash from illegal migration, preventing European nations from making effective deals with governments to halt illegal migration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Jean added that the solution to the problem is military force saying, &ldquo;something that is against the values of which we are very proud. That is, force would be needed, a massive intervention, to field a colonial-type army in Africa to stabilize regimes and regions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The big problem is that Europe is not a state, it has neither military nor political capacity to do something that can only be achieved with rather harsh methods, with occupation and strengthening of the governments of North Africa and the Sahel. We should operate like Wagner,&rdquo; he said and added that if Europe does not act military then it should resign itself to becoming a &ldquo;mestizo continent.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statements from General Jean come just weeks after Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani blamed PMC Wagner for the rise in illegal migration, which has close to tripled since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have indications that they are very active and in contact with gangs of traffickers and militiamen interested in the smuggling of migrants,&rdquo; Tajani said of the Russian private military group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tajani was joined in his view by Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, who PMC Wagner allegedly has a $15 million bounty on, according to Italian media reports.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/29/pope-francis-hospitalized-for-lung-infection-vatican/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/03/29/pope-francis-hospitalized-for-lung-infection-vatican/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pope Francis hospitalized for lung infection: Vatican</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pope Francis was hospitalized with a lung infection Wednesday after experiencing difficulty breathing in recent days and will remain in the hospital for several days of treatment, the Vatican said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 86-year-old pope doesn&rsquo;t have COVID-19, spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement late Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospitalization was the first since Francis spent 10 days at the Gemelli hospital in July 2021 to have 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It immediately raised questions about Francis&rsquo; overall health, and his ability to celebrate the busy Holy Week events that are due to begin this weekend with Palm Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruni said Francis had been suffering breathing troubles in recent days and went to the Gemelli for tests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The tests showed a respiratory infection (COVID-19 infection excluded) that will require some days of medical therapy,&rdquo; Bruni&rsquo;s statement said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francis appeared in relatively good form during his regularly scheduled general audience earlier Wednesday, though he grimaced strongly while getting in and out of the &ldquo;popemobile.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francis had part of one lung removed when he was a young man due to a respiratory infection, and he often speaks in a whisper.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he got through the worst phases of the COVID-19 pandemic without at least any public word of ever testing positive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francis had been due to celebrate Palm Sunday this weekend, kicking off the Vatican&rsquo;s Holy Week observances: Holy Thursday, Good Friday, the Easter Vigil and finally Easter Sunday on April 9.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has canceled all audiences through Friday, but it wasn&rsquo;t clear whether he could keep the Holy Week plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francis has used a wheelchair for over a year due to strained ligaments in his right knee and a small knee fracture. He has said the injury was healing and has been walking more with a cane of late.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francis also has said he resisted having surgery for the knee problems because he didn&rsquo;t respond well to general anesthesia during the 2021 intestinal surgery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said soon after the surgery that he had recovered fully and could eat normally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elon-musk-apple-co-founder-tech-experts-call-pause-giant-ai-experiments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elon-musk-apple-co-founder-tech-experts-call-pause-giant-ai-experiments</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Elon Musk, Apple co-founder, other tech experts call for pause on 'giant AI experiments': 'Dangerous race'</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and a host of other tech leaders and artificial intelligence experts are urging AI labs to pause development of powerful new AI systems in an open letter citing potential risks to society.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter asks AI developers to "immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4." It was issued by the Future of Life Institute and signed by more than 1,000 people, including Musk, who argued that safety protocols need to be developed by independent overseers to guide the future of AI systems. GPT-4 is the latest deep learning model from OpenAI, which "exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks," according to the lab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable," the letter said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter warns that at this stage, no one "can understand, predict, or reliably control" the powerful new tools developed in AI labs. The undersigned tech experts cite the risks of propaganda and lies spread through AI-generated articles that look real, and even the possibility that Ai programs can outperform workers and make jobs obsolete.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"AI labs and independent experts should use this pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are rigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts," the letter states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In parallel, AI developers must work with policymakers to dramatically accelerate development of robust AI governance systems."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signatories, which include Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque, researchers at Alphabet-owned DeepMind, as well as AI heavyweights Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell, emphasize that AI development in general should be not paused, writing that their letter is calling for "merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the European Union's transparency register, the Future of Life Institute is primarily funded by the Musk Foundation, as well as London-based effective altruism group Founders Pledge, and Silicon Valley Community Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, March 29th, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Let&rsquo;s get right into the news&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-nashville-police-release-body-cam-footage-showing-officers-neutralizing-school-shooter?utm_campaign=64487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-callout-id="edit_links_in_description">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-nashville-police-release-body-cam-footage-showing-officers-neutralizing-school-shooter?utm_campaign=64487</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Nashville police release body cam footage showing officers 'neutralizing' school shooter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Nashville Police have released bodycam footage of the school shooting that took place at Covenant Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The attack resulted in the deaths of six individuals, including three nine-year-old children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muz2EDhqEhs&amp;t=8s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRAPHIC WARNING: Officials Release Bodycam Footage From Nashville Elementary School Shooting</a>-Play 5:00-6:00</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The footage showed the heroism of police officers who quickly responded to the situation and took down the shooter Audrey Hale.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hale had gained entry by shooting through the glass panes of the front door, which was seen on surveillance footage that was released on Monday night by the Nashville police. Hale would go on to shoot and kill three students and three teachers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Surveillance footage released last night shows Hale's car driving through the school's parking lot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hale can be seen walking through a hallway as the alarm goes off, gun drawn.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Hale fired a number of rounds inside the Covenant Church/School building. She was armed with these 3 guns and significant ammunition," Nashville PD said in a report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hale, a transgender shooter, identified as male using the name 'Aiden' and 'he/him' pronouns. Hale killed head teacher Katherine Koonce, church custodian Mike Hill, and substitute teacher Cynthia Peak in an "assassination" style shooting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hale was a former student of Covenant Christian school and was found with multiple firearms. A search of the family home in Nashville uncovered maps and a manifesto detailing the attack, according to police at a Monday press conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden to issue new mandates to reduce emissions by 50% on cars, trucks by 2030</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden's climate czar, John Kerry, told Yahoo News that Joe Biden plans on pushing more mandates, especially on cars and trucks in the US, to help attain the goal of cutting US greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent by 2030 and for transportation vehicles to produce zero carbon emissions by 2050.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Kerry was asked about Biden's $739 billion Inflation Reduction Act, which allocated $369 billion on climate change goals and promised a 40 percent reduction in carbon emissions by decade's end and Kerry said, "Well, we're doing a lot more than just the IRA. The IRA is a package that in and of itself can get the 40%. But in addition to that, the president is issuing executive orders."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Biden white house has pushed for consumers to move to electric vehicles and have offered tax credits for those who purchase expensive vehicles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During the Trump administration, Kerry said, 70 percent of new energy came from renewables but he only speaks of Trump "reluctantly."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Kerry addressed what would happen if a new, Republican, administration took office in 2024 and undid Biden's dictates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Kerry said people will have to change their lifestyles to accommodate Biden's climate goals, especially when it comes to the use of gas for a utility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">AOC Warns of What &lsquo;Predatory Cisgender and Often Straight Men Do When Left in the Presence&rsquo; of Women and Children</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Conservatives, straight men, and &ldquo;predatory cisgender&rdquo; people are attacking transgender and LGBT people, in an effort to turn Americans against &ldquo;gender expressiveness,&rdquo; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ocasio-Cortez introduces one of her recent Instagram video commentaries by vilifying heterosexual men as sexual abuses and praising the LGBT+ community for standing up to them:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ocasio-Cortez begins her video by claiming that conservatives are using &ldquo;culture wars&rdquo; to turn Americans against LGBT people who are &ldquo;challenging the institutions of power&rdquo;:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That darn patriarchy&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/politics/mike-pence-grand-jury-testimony/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-callout-id="edit_links_in_description">https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/politics/mike-pence-grand-jury-testimony/index.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mike Pence must testify about conversations he had with Donald Trump leading up to January 6, judge rules</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A federal judge has decided that former Vice President Mike Pence must testify to a grand jury about conversations he had with Donald Trump leading up to January 6, 2021, according to multiple sources familiar with a recent federal court ruling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But the judge said &ndash; in a ruling that remains under seal &ndash; that Pence can still decline to answer questions related to his actions on January 6 itself, when he was serving as president of the Senate for the certification of the 2020 presidential election, according to one of the sources.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The ruling from chief judge James Boasberg of the US District Court in Washington, DC, is a major win for special counsel Jack Smith, who is spearheading the Justice Department investigation. Pence still has the ability to appeal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the lead-up to the congressional certification vote, Pence faced enormous pressure from Trump and his allies to disrupt lawmakers&rsquo; plans to validate Joe Biden&rsquo;s win. As president of the Senate, Pence was tasked with presiding over the certification proceedings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trump&rsquo;s conversations with Pence in the days surrounding the insurrection have been of keen interest to investigators probing the attack. Though Pence declined to testify before the House January 6 committee that investigated the insurrection, people in Trump&rsquo;s orbit told the committee about a heated phone call he had with Pence the day of the attack in which he lobbed insults at his vice president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Pence and Trump did not speak during the attack on the Capitol itself, in which many of Trump&rsquo;s supporters angrily sought him out, and Pence narrowly escaped the mob heading to the Senate floor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Nicholas Luna, a former special assistant to Trump, told the committee he remembered Trump calling Pence a &ldquo;wimp.&rdquo; Luna said he recalled something to the effect of Trump saying, &ldquo;I made the wrong decision four or five years ago.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">And Julie Radford, Ivanka Trump&rsquo;s former chief of staff, said she recalled Ivanka Trump telling her that &ldquo;her dad had just had an upsetting conversation with the vice president.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Radford said she was told that Trump had called Pence &ldquo;the P-word,&rdquo; referencing a derogatory term.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">For Pence&rsquo;s part, many of his public comments about his conversations with Trump in the days before and after the insurrection have come in a memoir he published last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the book, Pence wrote that Trump told him in the days before the attack that he would inspire the hatred of hundreds of thousands of people because he was &ldquo;too honest&rdquo; to attempt to overturn the results of the election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Over lunch on December 21, Pence wrote, he tried to steer Trump to listen to the White House counsel&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s advice, rather than outside lawyers, a suggestion the then-president shot down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hi Contrast Hymn Books</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Joe Biden attacks Republicans for positions he once held about Social Security</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden and the White House have attacked Republicans in recent months for positions the president himself once held on Social Security and entitlement programs including sunset bills and raising the retirement age, a CNN KFile review of Biden&rsquo;s record shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In his State of the Union address earlier this year, and in the months since, Biden has hammered Republicans over entitlements, saying they want to cut Social Security and Medicare. The president zeroed in on Florida Sen. Rick Scott&rsquo;s sunset plan &ndash; though Biden himself introduced a similar proposal in 1975 &ndash; which would have sunset all legislation without exemptions for the two entitlement programs. Once Biden started attacking Scott for the lack of exemptions for the entitlement programs, Scott added that his sunset provisions would not apply to Social Security or Medicare.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden first introduced a proposal in 1975 that would have ceased funding all federal programs &ndash; including Social Security and Medicare &ndash; unless they were reauthorized by Congress. In fact, Biden&rsquo;s bill was the first so-called federal sunset bill, something the president later boasted about in his 1978 Senate reelection campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden has also attacked Republicans, saying congressional Republicans want to cut the two entitlement programs and raise the retirement age to 70. The White House vowed to not support any increase in the retirement age in any future negotiations with Republicans even though Biden himself once proposed raising the retirement age as life expectancy went up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden, in one exchange pushing back against plans by then-President George W. Bush to partially privatize Social Security in 2005, said he was open to discussing benefit cuts to guarantee the solvency of the program.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, March 28th, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start today with the heartbreaking situation that unfolded in Nashville TN, Three children and three staff members were gunned down at a private Christian school in Nashville on Monday before the shooter, a heavily armed 28-year-old woman, was killed by police, authorities said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooting unfolded at The Covenant School on Burton Hills Boulevard where officers "engaged" the attacker, described by Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake as a woman who appears to be a former student at the school.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shooting at Nashville Christian school leaves at least 3 children and 3 adults dead, officials say</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooter was identified as Audrey Hale, a Nashville resident, three law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told NBC News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooter was killed on the school's second floor, a police spokesperson said. She had two "assault-type rifles and a handgun," according to the official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students of the school, which serves preschool students through sixth graders, were being bused to Woodmont Baptist Church, two miles away, to be reunited with their parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said they first got calls about the shooter at 10:13 a.m. CT and Nashville firefighters first reported their personnel were responding to an &ldquo;active aggressor&rdquo; at 10:39 a.m. CT.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The police department response was swift," police spokesperson Don Aaron told reporters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five police officers came upon the shooter and two opened fire on her, Aaron said. The shooter entered the school through a "side entrance" on the first floor, he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not clear how the shooter gained access to the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One officer was hurt by shattered glass, officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The names and ages of the victims have not been released. The chief said the families of all six victims had been notified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please lift that school, and those affected families in your prayers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/republicans-introduce-resolution-scrap-student-forgiveness"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/republicans-introduce-resolution-scrap-student-forgiveness</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Republicans announce resolution to scrap Biden student loan forgiveness plan</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Bob Good (R-VA) and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) announced legislation Monday to scrap President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the resolution, Congress will express disapproval of the student loan cancellation plan to overturn the program, which is stuck in limbo amid a court battle. The resolution will need a simple majority to clear the Senate and is expected to draw a veto from Biden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Senate side, Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) are backing the Congressional Review Act resolution alongside Cassidy, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden unveiled the student loan forgiveness plan last August to much fanfare from progressives. Under the initiative, borrowers with an annual income of $125,000 or less can have up to $10,000 in federal student loans canceled, while those who received Pell Grants during their schooling can have up to $20,000 wiped out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program stems from the 2003 HEROES Act, which grants the executive power to relieve student loan debt in times of national emergency or war. Critics have pointed out that Biden deemed the COVID-19 pandemic was "over" in a 60 Minutes interview last year. The pandemic was used as justification for using the HEROES Act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last November, a lower court in Texas halted the program amid pending legal challenges. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the program's legality by June or July.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House says it has amassed roughly 26 million applications and approved 16 million for relief, but cancellation has not yet taken place amid the legal wrangling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden used his veto power for the first time last week to reject a resolution that would've nixed a Labor Department rule permitting retirement plans to take into account environmental, social, and governance considerations in investment decisions.</span></p>

<p><strong>FDIC says First Citizens Bank has reached deal to purchase Silicon Valley Bank</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Silicon Valley Bank finally has a buyer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company of Raleigh, North Carolina entered a purchase agreement for all deposits and loans of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, National Association.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The 17 former branches of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, National Association, will open as First&ndash;Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company on Monday, March 27, 2023," the FDIC said in a statement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Customers of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, National Association, should continue to use their current branch until they receive notice from First&ndash;Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company that systems conversions have been completed to allow full&ndash;service banking at all of its other branch locations," the statement continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depositors of the Santa Clara, California-located bank will automatically become depositors of First&ndash;Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company, according to the statement, and all deposits will be assumed and insured by First&ndash;Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company, up to the insurance limit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDIC said: "As of March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, National Association, had approximately $167 billion in total assets and about $119 billion in total deposits. Today's transaction included the purchase of about $72 billion of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, National Association's assets at a discount of $16.5 billion."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, approximately $90 billion in securities and other assets will remain in the receivership for disposition by the FDIC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the statement, the FDIC and First&ndash;Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company entered into a "loss&ndash;share transaction" on all commercial loans it purchased from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDIC estimated SVB's failure cost approximately $20 billion, although a cost will be more accurately determined when the FDIC terminates the receivership, it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDIC created Silicon Valley Bridge Bank after the California Department of Financial Protection &amp; Innovation closed Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, March 10. All of the deposits&mdash;both insured and uninsured&mdash;were transferred to the bridge bank.</span></p>

<p><strong>Progressive Portland area school administrator arrested in human sex trafficking sting</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight men, including a Portland-area high school administrator, were arrested and charged in relation to their alleged participation in a sex trafficking sting conducted by local law enforcement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As announced by the city of Lake Oswego's police department, they "conducted a human sex trafficking mission with the assistance of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office, Oregon City Police, Milwaukie Police, and Sandy Police," on Thursday, March 23, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"During the operation, decoys (law enforcement officers) were contacted by men who offered to pay money in exchange for the decoys to perform requested sexual acts," the department stated, going on to describe how the eight suspects allegedly agreed to meet with the supposed trafficking victims, and were subsequently "arrested and charged with the relevant crimes."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspects Stephen R. Berry, Maximilien Aquitaine, Austin L. Olson, Vincent S. Namauleg, German D. Pascual, Jake R. Walt, and Erik J. Bjorman were all cited and released for Commercial Sexual Solicitation, officials said. However, according to the Lake Oswego Police Department, the assistant principal of Centennial High School in Gresham, Oregon was hit with additional charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Terrance A. Schloth (1/11/71) of Gresham, OR initially gave a false name and refused to identify himself," police stated. "As a result, he was lodged at the Clackamas County Jail in order to get a positive identification. He was charged for Commercial Sexual Solicitation (ORS 167.008) and the additional charge of Giving False Information to a Peace Officer in Connection with a Citation (ORS 162.385)."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to 52-year-old Schloth's LinkedIn page, he had been working in education for over 27 years, going from a Reynolds High School physical education teacher, to educational leader, to dean of students, and eventually serving as the assistant principal in 2014 before moving to the Centennial School District.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schloth was a progressive. His LinkedIn boasts of anti-bullying and restorative justice initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his school profile, two of the accused administrator's children attend Centennial as well. The school district placed Schloth on administrative leave following his arrest, Conan Daily reported.</span></p>]]></description>
