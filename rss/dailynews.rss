<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Manifesto of trans Nashville school shooter LEAKED, full of anti-white hate</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leaked manifesto reveals the Nashville trans school shooter had a violent hatred of the &ldquo;little crackers&rdquo; with &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; that were murdered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First obtained and released by the Louder with Crowder conservative Rumble show, the three-page handwritten document allegedly shows Audrey &ldquo;Aiden&rdquo; Hale meticulously planned her last moments and the mass school shooting at The Covenant School on March 27. Three young children and three school staff were killed before Hale, 28, was shot dead by responding police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manifesto, written in a spiral notebook, has various creeds and thoughts scrawled down by pen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;DEATH DAY,&rdquo; Hale wrote on one page with the drawing of a target reticle and a pistol, along with the date &ldquo;3/27/23.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The day has finally come!" Hale wrote. "I can't believe its [sic] here. Don't know how I was able to get this far, but here I am. I'm a little nervous but excited too. Been excited for the past 2 weeks."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale continued: "There were several times I could have been caught especially back in the summer of 2021. None of that matters now. I am almost an hour &amp; 7 minutes away."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m doing this, but I&rsquo;m ready," Hale wrote. "I hope my victims aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale later prayed to God in the manifesto to help her in the mass shooting. "(God let my wrath take over my anxiety) It might be 10 minutes tops. It might be 3-7. It's gonna go quick," Hale wrote. "I hope I have a high death count."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale then wrote, "Ready to Die nana" and signed it "Aiden," Hale's trans name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another page, Hale wrote a detailed day schedule, with a post-it calmly asking, "Lunch may be [sic] around 11 am&ndash;1 pm?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale's day began at 6:30 a.m., and ran through getting dressed, breakfast and what to do with the "stuffed animals &amp; possessions." At 9:30, Hale was to "pack up special belongings in backpack(s)."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 10:20, Hale was to "gear up &amp; set up guns in trunk (assembly) &amp; get out vest (w/mags inside)." Hale was armed with a handgun, a rifle and a pistol modded to handle like a rifle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale also wrote about making a "final video tape" on the schedule, though this has not been released by police or confirmed to even exist. Hale detailed a plan to leave for the Covenant School by 11:35.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last entries to Hale's schedule were for 12:35, where she would "open fire," and then it was "time 2 die [sic]." Hale was shot dead by police at around 10:27.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of the pages headlined, "Kill those kids!!!,&rdquo; Hale calls the students &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; and expresses hatred for their &ldquo;white privilege.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale also wrote a bunch of more obscenities about the kids that I won&rsquo;t mention&hellip; but you get the idea.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities have been criticized for months for not releasing Hale's manifesto. A source with the Louder with Crowder show told The Post Millennial that they received the photographs of Hale's notebook from a "source near law enforcement."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hales mass shooting earlier this year preceded a planned "Trans Day of Vengeance" event in the U.S. capital that was ultimately canceled. And in the immediate hours after the shooting, trans activists occupied several state capitol buildings to protest pending legislation restricting the transitioning of children. At the capitol in Nashville, trans activists held a moment of silence for the victims of the mass shooting. They held up seven fingers to include Hale as among the victims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell, a Democrat, says his office is immediately investigating the unauthorized release of some of the images from the Nashville trans shooter&rsquo;s manifesto. Authorities have tried to prevent the release of Hale&rsquo;s writings before today&rsquo;s leak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-nashville-mayor-launches-investigation-into-leak-of-trans-nashville-shooters-manifesto?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-nashville-mayor-launches-investigation-into-leak-of-trans-nashville-shooters-manifesto?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nashville mayor launches investigation into leak of trans Nashville shooter's manifesto</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the leak of the transgender Nashville shooter&rsquo;s alleged manifesto on Monday morning, Mayor Freddie O&rsquo;Connell said that the city has launched an investigation into how the images of the writings were released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I have directed Wally Dietz, Metro&rsquo;s Law Director, to initiate an investigation into how these images could have been released. That investigation may involve local, state, and federal authorities. I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving," O&rsquo;Connell said in a statement, according to WSMV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This incident naturally invokes additional emotional trauma, and families or individuals who need support should reach out to professionals at National Alliance on Mental Illness (615-891-4724), MNPD support counselors (615-862-7773) or MNPS Family Information Center (615-259-INFO)."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday morning, Steven Crowder released three handwritten pages of what he said were Audrey Hale&rsquo;s manifesto. These highlighted an anti-white sentiment held by the shooter that killed three young students and three staff members of the Covenant School on March 27, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pages apparently show Hale planning the day of the shooting down to the minute, including in all capital letters at the top of the page, "DEATH DAY." A source with the Louder with Crowder show told The Post Millennial that they received the photographs of Hale's notebook from a "source near law enforcement."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-jury-says-nyag-has-no-case-heated-testimony"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-jury-says-nyag-has-no-case-heated-testimony</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trump demands jury, says New York AG has 'no case' in heated testimony</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump demanded a jury Monday after his unprecedented time on the stand, calling the civil trial against him and his businesses a "disgrace" and saying New York Attorney General Letitia James has "no case."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump described his forced testimony as "election interference" while maintaining that his net worth is "far greater" than financial statements during testimony Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The President and 2024 Republican presidential front-runner took the stand Monday morning in the non-jury civil trial stemming from James&rsquo; lawsuit against him, his family and his businesses. James alleged Trump defrauded banks and inflated the value of his assets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly said his assets were actually undervalued. Trump has repeatedly said his financial statements had disclaimers, requesting that the numbers be evaluated by the banks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I think this case is a disgrace," he said, adding that people are being "murdered" in New York as James is "watching this case."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s a disgrace. It is election interference because you want to keep me in court all day long," Trump said while on the stand after testifying for more than five hours. "And Judge &hellip; I want a jury."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Trump's attorneys, at the end of the President's testimony, said that in "33 years," they have "never had a witness testify better."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"An absolutely brilliant performance by President Trump. He's not backing down. He's told everyone the facts," the Trump attorney said. "Now that the American people know what's going on, maybe something will change."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James, a Democrat, sued Trump, his children and the Trump Organization last year, alleging that he and his company misled banks and others about the value of his assets. James said the President&rsquo;s children &ndash; Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric &ndash; and his associates and businesses committed "numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation" on their financial statements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James filed the lawsuit against Trump "under a consumer protection statute that denies the right to a jury," a Trump spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There was never an option to choose a jury trial," the spokesperson said. "It is unfortunate that a jury won&rsquo;t be able to hear how absurd the merits of this case are and conclude no wrongdoing ever happened."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Trump&rsquo;s unprecedented testimony Monday, New York Judge Arthur Engoron tried to cut him off from providing lengthy answers to state lawyers&rsquo; questioning, and he even said, "I don&rsquo;t want to hear everything he has to say."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Trump defended himself and his businesses while on the stand and blasted the investigation, lawsuit and non-jury trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We shouldn&rsquo;t be having a case here because we have a disclaimer clause that every court holds up except this judge," Trump said, referring to the disclaimers on all of his financial statements and statements of financial condition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump went on to call James a "political hack," saying she used her investigation and lawsuit against him "to become governor, to become attorney general." The President was referring to James&rsquo; campaigns in which she vowed to "get Trump."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engoron, in September, ruled that Trump and the Trump Organization committed fraud while building his real estate empire by deceiving banks, insurers and others by overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He ruled against me without knowing anything about me," Trump said on the stand. "He called me a fraud, and he didn&rsquo;t know anything about me."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump went on to slam Engoron for undercutting the value of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida &mdash; a property that Engoron valued at $18 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's testimony concluded Monday afternoon. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, who was dismissed as a defendant in the case this summer, is set to testify on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/04/michigan-football-staffer-fired-after-allegedly-trying-meet-13-year-old-girl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/04/michigan-football-staffer-fired-after-allegedly-trying-meet-13-year-old-girl/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michigan Football Staffer Fired After Allegedly Trying to Meet 13-Year-Old Girl</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Michigan has fired football staffer Alex Yood after he was accused of attempting to meet up with a 13-year-old girl, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yood was apparently fired in September after the allegations appeared in an Instagram video that accused him of arranging to meet an underaged girl, 247 Sports reported on November 2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firing was confirmed on November 3 in an email sent by the university and reported by the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video that spurred the firing, Yood appears to admit that he was planning to meet a girl he was speaking to online.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confronted at a liquor store holding a bottle of spirits, Yood is told that the girl he is planning to meet is only 13. He replies that he didn&rsquo;t know her age but is told that some of the texts prove that he was aware she was only 13.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find the video in the article in my show notes, and it&rsquo;s about 10 minutes long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men in the video also claim that Yood asked the &ldquo;girl&rdquo; if she was a virgin. The men follow Yood out to his car, and he drives away as they yell at him and call him a pedophile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear what role the men who confronted Yood have in the incident or how they became privy to the text messages Yood allegedly sent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the video was apparently made by an online vigilante named Boopac Shakur, a man known for exposing sexual predators. In a wholly separate incident, Shakur was shot and killed in Michigan during an argument at the end of September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school apparently cut ties with Yood quickly afterward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alex Yood is no longer part of the athletic department,&rdquo; a school official told the Mail. &ldquo;An issue was brought to our attention, and we immediately moved to handle the matter with our HR department. &rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are unable to comment further regarding this employment matter,&rdquo; the email added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation with Yood only adds to the pressures on the University of Michigan football program as allegations of sign stealing continue reverberating, spurring calls for coach Jim Harbaugh to be fired.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>187K Migrants Apprehended at Border in First Month of New Year &mdash; 30K More Gotaways</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol agents assigned to the southwest border with Mexico apprehended more than 187,000 migrants during October &mdash; the first month of the new fiscal year. A source within U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated another 30,000 migrants were reported as &ldquo;known gotaways.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents assigned to the nine southwest Border Patrol sectors apprehended more than 187,000 migrants during October, according to documents reviewed by Breitbart Texas. This is the fourth consecutive month that agents apprehended more than 130,000 migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the more than 187,000 apprehensions, agents reported more than 30,000 migrants as known gotaways. This is a conservative estimate of migrants observed crossing the border but not apprehended by agents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unofficial report revealed the Tucson Sector had the most apprehensions. More than 55,000 migrants were apprehended in this sector alone. This is up from 51,000 in September. One year ago, agents in this sector apprehended less than 23,000 migrants. This represents a year-over-year increase of 149 percent over the prior October.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Del Rio Sector followed Tucson with the apprehension of approximately 38,000 migrants. This is down slightly from the nearly 43,000 migrants apprehended in October 2022 and is up significantly from the 28,000 apprehended in October 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rio Grande Valley, San Diego, and El Paso Sectors rounded out the top five sectors with approximately 32,000, 29,000, and 22,000, respectively. The Rio Grande Valley and San Diego Sectors are up significantly from the prior October reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the Canadian border, the Swanton Sector continues its spike in migrant apprehensions. Agents in the sector that covers the Canadian border in eastern New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire apprehended more than 1,000 migrants in the first month of FY24.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is up by nearly 200 percent over October 2022 and is roughly equal to the apprehensions for the entire Fiscal Year 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/01/dc-hands-vehicle-tracking-residents-keep-cars-stolen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/01/dc-hands-vehicle-tracking-residents-keep-cars-stolen/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blue City Hands Out Vehicle &lsquo;Tracking Tags&rsquo; To Residents Because People Keep Getting Their Cars Stolen</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced on Wednesday that she has started a pilot program that will give some drivers a tracking device to attach to their cars so they will be able to find their vehicle if it gets stolen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tags, which will be given to residents in six of the city&rsquo;s most vehicle theft-prone areas, will be installed inside the car and will be trackable via an app on the owner&rsquo;s phone, the mayor&rsquo;s office said in a press release. The devices appear to be Apple AirTags, according to a photo posted by Bowser on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto thefts in D.C. have increased 101% since last year, with 5,916 cars being stolen since January, police data showed. Violent crime in the city has increased 41%, while total crime has grown by 27% since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local officials claimed that the apps would help citizens recover their stolen cars more quickly and would allow officers to solve crimes more quickly or efficiently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our goal is not just to prevent carjackings and motor vehicle thefts, but also to ensure swift law enforcement action when these incidents occur,&rdquo; acting Chief of Police Pamela A. Smith said in the press release. &ldquo;These tracking devices allow our officers and detectives to be better positioned to quickly locate stolen vehicles, recover property, and gather vital evidence for investigations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowser has attempted to walk back the city&rsquo;s lenient approach toward crime in the past few months, unveiling a crime bill that eliminates several police reforms D.C. enacted after the George Floyd riots in 2020. D.C. first responders have said that they feel less safe because of the rising crime in the area, while many locals throughout the city complained at a House Judiciary meeting about the open crime that often takes place in broad daylight.</span></p>

<p><strong>Republicans Grill HHS Over &lsquo;Unconstitutional&rsquo; Trans Pronoun Mandate for Employees</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers are demanding answers from President Joe Biden&rsquo;s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) about its new guidelines ordering agency employees to refer to transgender coworkers by their &ldquo;preferred pronouns.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Mary Miller (R-IL) is leading several other GOP lawmakers in sending a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, grilling him for answers about the &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; guidance and how it applies to religious employees. Breitbart News exclusively obtained a copy of the letter on Wednesday before it was sent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We recently learned that the Biden Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is compelling political speech and violating the religious liberty rights of HHS employees by imposing a transgender pronoun mandate on your employees,&rdquo; the letter reads. &ldquo;We write to express our strong opposition to your illegal and unconstitutional transgender pronoun mandate, the so-called &lsquo;HHS Gender Non-Discrimination and Inclusion Policy,&rsquo; which is a violation of the First Amendment rights of HHS employees.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Your pronoun mandate clearly infringes upon the religious liberty and free speech rights of employees, who cannot be coerced into engaging in political speech or speech that violates their deeply held religious beliefs,&rdquo; the letter continues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers wrote the letter based on an alleged HHS internal email obtained by Roger Severino, vice president of domestic policy for the Heritage Foundation and former director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights during the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HHS, which employs approximately 80,000 people in the United States and abroad, imposed its new &ldquo;Gender Identity and Non-Discrimination Guidance&rdquo; in early October; it outlines &ldquo;employee rights and protections related to gender identity,&rdquo; the alleged email reads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;All employees should be addressed [by] the names and pronouns they use to describe themselves,&rdquo; the email continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HHS also posted a video to YouTube &mdash; designated as &ldquo;unlisted&rdquo; &mdash; in which HHS Secretary Andrea Palm says the policy allows colleagues &ldquo;to show up every day as their whole selves.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Zm3p1nKTPs8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/Zm3p1nKTPs8</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play 0:00-1:10</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Palm did mention religion, neither the video nor the email disclosed if the HHS plans on accommodating or exempting employees with religious objections to affirming transgender delusions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Rachel Levine, who describes himself as&nbsp; &ldquo;an out and proud transgender woman&rdquo; in the video, said this policy ensures that &ldquo;all HHS employees, including transgender and nonbinary employees, have equal protections in the workplace.&rdquo; He added that all supervisors and managers are responsible for enforcing the policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Every one of us can play a role in creating a welcoming workplace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every one of you can make a difference in improving the feelings of inclusion for your coworkers.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>US seeks to ramp up munitions production for Ukraine, Israel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden&rsquo;s $106 billion defense spending supplemental request to Congress aims in part to bolster munitions production capacity to continue rushing arms to Ukraine and Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at a Tuesday hearing on the status of U.S. stockpiles and the workforce, supply chain and infrastructure constraints of weapons manufacturers racing to replenish them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate is formulating its supplemental spending bill encompassing both Ukraine and Israel aid, while the House is set to vote on a stand-alone Israel aid bill later this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There are some limitations in terms of how quickly they can do certain things,&rdquo; said Austin. &ldquo;There will continue to be workforce challenges. And when you expand capacity, there&rsquo;s this issue of the time it takes to build the capacity and make sure the lines are running smoothly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin noted some defense contractors have required workers to take on additional shifts to keep up with production rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What they&rsquo;ve done in a lot of cases to meet urgent needs is double and triple shifts so that they can in some cases crank out munitions and weapons at a much greater speed,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin&rsquo;s comments come as Israel rapidly burns through munitions as it continues to bomb the 2.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 8,500 people and wounding more than 21,500, per the Gaza Health Ministry. Shortly before the hearing, Israel bombed the Jabalia refugee camp, which the Health Ministry lambasted as a &ldquo;horrific massacre&rdquo; that killed at least 50 people and wounded hundreds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the latest of many civilian targets Israel has bombed in its campaign to destroy Hamas. Israel launched its campaign following Hamas&rsquo; massacre of approximately 1,400 Israelis and abduction of 240 hostages, per the Israel Defense Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, the Biden administration has less than $5.5 billion remaining to continue transferring weapons to Ukraine as the nation&rsquo;s slow-moving counteroffensive fails to retake significant tracts of territory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s requested defense supplemental includes $44.4 billion to continue arming Ukraine and $14.3 billion in military aid for Israel. That request includes more Iron Dome interceptors to stop Hamas rockets and additional munitions for Israel to continue its bombardment of Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large portion of the requested funding would go toward backfilling U.S. stockpiles of weapons the Biden administration has so far sent Ukraine and Israel. There&rsquo;s also $3 billion requested to expand industrial base capacity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We simply do not have the workforce, supply chain or infrastructure necessary to meet the coming threats,&rdquo; Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., said at the hearing. &ldquo;Building out this capacity is going to take time and resources, but we can start now by making targeted investments in our munitions production base.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s supplemental request includes $30 billion to replenish weapons sent to Ukraine as well as funding to backfill stocks given to Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As a general rule, we&rsquo;re going to do everything that we can to meet the demands that we see in both Ukraine and Israel,&rdquo; Austin said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and NATO continue to face a shortage of 155mm ammunition and are providing those shells both to Ukraine and Israel.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adam Johnson&rsquo;s Aunt Demanding &lsquo;Justice&rsquo; After &lsquo;Reckless&rsquo; Kick that Left Him Dead</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former NHL player Adam Johnson&rsquo;s family is demanding that officials in the U.K. do something to bring justice to the man whose actions ended Johnson&rsquo;s life during an Oct. 28 game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 29-year-old Johnson, who played with the Pittsburgh Penguins from 2018 to 2020, was playing in a Challenge Cup game for the Nottingham Panthers against the Sheffield Steelers in the UK&rsquo;s Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) when Steelers player Matt Petgrave raised his leg into the air and slammed Johnson in the neck with his deadly skate blade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson was rushed to a local hospital, but he lost too much blood and was pronounced dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Johnson&rsquo;s 62-year-old aunt is charging that Petgrave&rsquo;s actions were negligent, and she wants the police in the U.K. to charge him in Johnson&rsquo;s death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It was very reckless,&rdquo; Kari Johnson said of the &ldquo;horrific tragedy&rdquo; of her nephew&rsquo;s death, according to the New York Post. &ldquo;I just want them [authorities investigating] to get it right. We are looking for justice for Adam.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Pergrave&rsquo;s kick was &ldquo;not hockey&rdquo; and insisted, &ldquo;My nephew was 6 feet tall, and whether you lost your balance or not, to have that leg come up that high and do a kicking motion like he did, that is just unacceptable.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a hockey play, that&rsquo;s not a check. I understand that every team has an enforcer, per se, on their team,&rdquo; Johnson reiterated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Kari Johnson has carefully noted that she does not think Petgrave struck Johnson in the neck with his skate on purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Petgrave probably didn&rsquo;t even think about the consequences could be of that happening, but there comes a time when you have to realize that&rsquo;s not hockey,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s going through a lot, too, but he took our boy. There are a few of us in the family that think it was a totally unnecessary, very, very bad action to take.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Petgrave, he is reportedly &ldquo;distraught&rdquo; and has been &ldquo;receiving vile messages online.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, South Yorkshire Police officials said they are investigating the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police did not say, though, if they were investigating the incident as a criminal act.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so long ago, the American dream was alive and well. Employees who worked hard were rewarded, and employers looked for people who could do the job, not for people who had the right political views.&nbsp; RedBalloon.work is a job site designed to get us back to what made American businesses successful: free speech, hard work, and having fun.&nbsp; If you are a free speech employer who wants to hire employees who focus on their work and not identity politics, then post a job on RedBalloon.&nbsp; If you are an employee who is being censored at work or is being forced to comply with the current zeitgeist, post your resume on RedBalloon and look for a new job. redballoon.work, the job site where free speech is still alive!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/only-3-5-of-americans-opted-to-get-latest-covid-shot-cdc?utm_campaign=64487#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/only-3-5-of-americans-opted-to-get-latest-covid-shot-cdc?utm_campaign=64487#google_vignette</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Only 3.5% of Americans opted to get latest Covid shot: CDC</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New data from the Centers for Disease Control has revealed that just 3.5 percent of Americans opted to receive the latest Covid booster shot despite the Biden administration urging Americans 60 years of age and older, as well as those who are immunocompromised, to vaccinate themselves against a "tripledemic" of the latest Covid strain, the flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of demand for the new vaccine has pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer recording losses, with much of its stock having to be thrown out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CDC, just 7 percent of adults and 2 percent of children in the United States got inoculated against the recent strains of Covid, a stark decrease from the initial vaccine rollout.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling shows that those numbers aren't likely to get much higher in the coming months and years, with 40 percent of Americans saying they probably or definitely won't get another Covid shot, and a similar percentage saying the same when asked whether they will vaccinate their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As PBS reports, despite the fact that Covid deaths and hospitalizations are lower this year than in the previous three years of the virus' existence, an expert called the latest vaccination numbers "abysmal."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the Biden administration called on vaccine manufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Novovax to make new Covid vaccines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with the New York Times, Boston Children's Hospital vaccine program director and Food and Drug Administration adviser Dr. Ofer Levy called the availability of vaccines against RSV, Covid, and the flu a "godsend" for vulnerable Americans. He noted that tens of thousands die every year as the result of viral infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their efforts, fewer Americans have sought a fresh dose of the vaccine due in large part to the prevalence of previous vaccinations and infections, which have led to milder cases for many. Other reasons that may be influencing their decisions include the fact that unlike before, the jabs are no longer free, though they may still be covered under some insurance policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://timcast.com/news/pfizer-hid-nearly-80-of-covid-vaccine-trial-deaths-from-regulators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://timcast.com/news/pfizer-hid-nearly-80-of-covid-vaccine-trial-deaths-from-regulators/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pfizer Hid Nearly 80% of Covid Vaccine Trial Deaths From Regulators</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to new forensic analysis in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, and Research, Pfizer failed to disclose evidence of more than a 3.7-fold increase in the number of cardiac deaths among vaccine recipients compared to those who received a placebo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This means that 79 percent of relevant deaths were not recorded in time to be included in Pfizer&rsquo;s regulatory paperwork,&rdquo; Angelo DePalma, Ph.D. wrote for Children&rsquo;s Health Defense (CHD) regarding the study. &ldquo;By not including relevant subject deaths in the case report, Pfizer obscured cardiac adverse event signals, allowing the EUA to proceed unchallenged.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A comparison of the number of deaths per week during the 33 weeks of the study found no significant difference between the number of deaths in vaccinated versus placebo groups for the first 20 weeks, the placebo-controlled portion of the trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;After week 20, as subjects in the placebo were vaccinated, deaths among this still unvaccinated cohort of this group slowed and eventually plateaued,&rdquo; researchers found. Deaths in the &ldquo;vaccinated subjects continued at the same rate,&rdquo; leading the scientists to inconsistencies between the data Pfizer reported and the actual number of deaths reported after vaccination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CHD, Pfizer&rsquo;s clinical trial abandoned standard practices when at week 20 it allowed &ldquo;unblinding,&rdquo; where the placebo group was allowed to switch to the vaccinated group. Typically, they note, this only occurs when the benefit of the drug is so great that not treating subjects becomes unethical.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Normally the decision to unblind a vaccine trial would be based on the product&rsquo;s safety and effectiveness in reaching certain endpoints or objectives,&rdquo; CHD explained. &ldquo;But, perhaps unexpectedly, after 33 weeks the data revealed no significant difference between deaths in the vaccinated and placebo groups for the initial 20-week placebo-controlled portion of the trial.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHD added, &ldquo;Had Pfizer-BioNTech met their legal and ethical obligation to report all serious adverse events their data would have shown equal deaths in placebo and vaccine groups &mdash; which would have shown no clear benefit for the vaccine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Oct. 31, Pfizer reported a net loss of $2.38 billion due to &ldquo;write-offs of Covid products.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why Justin Trudeau Is Blaming Grocers for Surging Food Prices in Canada</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New government data emerged this week showing that food prices in Canada continue to climb.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though year-over-year inflation of consumer prices overall cooled to 3.8% in September, food prices increased 5.8% from a year ago, driven by surging prices of bakery products (up 8%), fresh vegetables (7.6%), pasta products (10.8%), and poultry (6.5%).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food prices have long been a sore spot for Canadians. Even prior to 2023, statistics showed that some 7 million Canadians, including 1.8 million children, were in households struggling to put food on the table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As inflation continued to drive food prices upward in 2023, consumer outrage quickly mounted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m paying that much, I hope there&rsquo;s gold in that chicken,&rdquo; one user responded to a viral tweet in January showing a $37 price tag on a package of chicken breasts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The episode prompted accusations of price gouging and a high-profile story in the New York Times &mdash; but the paper reported that outrage at grocers was misplaced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s easy to get angry at the grocer, there&rsquo;s very little evidence that the grocers are actually taking advantage of the situation,&rdquo; said Mike von Massow, a food economics professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food prices have only gotten worse since then, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, apparently not a reader of the New York Times, has found the same scapegoat as many others unversed in basic economics: grocers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Trudeau threatened to slap grocery stores with new taxes if they don&rsquo;t find a way to lower food prices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Large grocery chains are making record profits. Those profits should not be made on the backs of people who are struggling to feed their families,&rdquo; Trudeau told an Ontario crowd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking aim at grocers and &ldquo;record profits,&rdquo; Trudeau is parroting the rhetoric of some U.S. politicians, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has argued that inflation is being driven by &ldquo;corporate greed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that corporations suddenly became greedy in the aftermath of the pandemic never passed the economic smell test, and it was recently rebutted in a Federal Reserve paper.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Corporate profit margins were not abnormally high in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, once fiscal and monetary interventions are accounted for,&rdquo; noted Dino Palazzo, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet politicians such as Trudeau, who less than a year ago criticized the idea of using a windfall tax on grocery companies to lower food prices, have repeated the claim over and over again that greedy corporations are the root cause of inflation. Why?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is simple: the true blame for inflation lies with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada&rsquo;s Conservative Party, hit the nail on the head in a recent interview when he pointed out that the Canadian government&rsquo;s policies are to blame for inflation &mdash; as are those who lead it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[Trudeau] prints $600 billion, grows our money supply by 32% in three years,&rdquo; Poilievre said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s growing the money eight times faster than the economy. No wonder we have the worst inflation in four decades.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the mystery of inflation. (It&rsquo;s not really a mystery.) Politicians and central banks flooded the economy with money, which devalued the currency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic economics teaches that increasing the money supply faster than an economy can provide new goods and services will result in price inflation, and that is precisely what we&rsquo;ve witnessed. Indeed, for much of modern history, inflation was defined as expansion of the money supply, not an increase in prices (which is the consequence of expanding the money supply). Henry Hazlitt famously explained the difference in Economics in One Lesson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Inflation is an increase in the quantity of money and credit. Its chief consequence is soaring prices,&rdquo; Hazlitt explained. &ldquo;Therefore inflation &mdash; if we misuse the term to mean the rising prices themselves &mdash; is caused solely by printing more money.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politicians such as Trudeau cannot, of course, admit it&rsquo;s their own policies and money printing that are to blame for high food prices. So they hold speeches blaming grocery stores and food producers for the inflation they caused and threaten them with new taxes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether Canadians will see through Trudeau&rsquo;s crude charade is unclear. What is clear is that Canadian grocers are not responsible for the skyrocketing price of food in Canada. Justin Trudeau and the Bank of Canada are.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anaheim high schools mandate courses in far-left activism, political engagement, and 'ethnic studies'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American educational system has been intentionally picked apart and deconstructed. Where once the goal of education was to relay cultural knowledge from arts and literature to science and maths, recent decades have seen an intentional shift toward the obliteration of that form of education, and in essence, the erasure of the cultural knowledge that has been imparted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical race and gender theory are also used as part of the furtherence of these goals, which parents have spoken up against in recent years. The intent of this new form of education is the erasure of the culture, history, arts, letters and sciences that elevated American society to the echelons of global dominance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowhere is this more evident than in the classroom. The course selection and the currciculum being offered in the award-winning Anaheim Union High School District, was uncovered by Parents Defending Education (PDE).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via a public records request, PDE learned that 16 Ethnic Studies courses have been approved for Anaheim high school students. The terminology of "ethnic studies" is a ruse for a course of study that undermines American culture and seeks to turn students from scholars into activists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Anaheim Union High School District has peppered its district in so-called 'Ethnic Studies' courses," said Caroline Moore, Vice President of Parents Defending Education. "Unlike what we&rsquo;ve seen throughout California, this district purposely inserts race, identity, and racism into classes ranging from Spanish to Dance. Their students would better be served by learning history based in truth and facts, as opposed to dancing out their supposed 'Eurocentric' racism or 'oppressor' mentality.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A course called "Cultural Experiences in America" intends to "provide an emancipatory education." The goal here is to teach students the way that "their identities, including race, ethnicity, culture, and nationality" are "socially constructed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, that means the goal is to teach students the way that American culture has oppressed them. In this course, American culture is the enemy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Course descriptions use language that, at first glance, sounds harmless enough. But it's essential to get these definitions straight. "Emancipatory education" is a phrase coined by Paulo Freire, author of "Pedagogy of the Oppressed," a core text for those dismantling education.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is precisely the course of study Anaheim has in mind with courses like "English I: Ethnic Studies," which is required for graduation. The description of the course states as its goal the promotion of political activism. The course "expands on the understanding of each student's social responsibility to their community and the world. By encouraging agency and student voice through the use of present social reform, political movements and social justice topics, students will gain an understanding of the world around them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Students will explore the experiences of Indigenous/Native American, Black/African American, Chicanx/Latinx and Asian/Asian American and Pacific Islander in all their complexity and diversity," the course description continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A theater course could more accurately be described as an activism course. "Ethnic Studies Theater: The Art of Storytellling" is a course that advocates for students to critique "social constructs that have been conditioned through systems of oppression and underrepresentation as well as misrepresentation to find and develop their own voices through the medium of theater."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A required component are "Project Based Learning Assignments" that are intended to "foster active consciousness, social engagement and agency" through the study of "the histories of race, ancestry, national origin, disapora, racism, hegemony, ethnicity, and culture."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This course is designed to first teach the students that they are oppressed, teach them who to blame for that oppression, and how to become activists who endeavor to free themselves and all of society from the burden of that oppression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives in America caught on too late, and despite the recent attempts by parents and education activists to slam on the brakes, the deconstructionist forms of curriculum keep rolling in. What first reared its ugly head in education graduate programs has now been fully disseminated into American education at large.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, November 1st, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Samaritan Ministries:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are you planning to pay your medical bills in 2024? Before answering that question, here</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">are three reasons you should look into health care sharing with Samaritan Ministries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, there are no networks which means you choose the doctors and hospitals you go to, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a say in the treatments you receive. Two, you&rsquo;re part of a Christian community. When you have a medical need, fellow members send money directly to you to help you pay your shareable medical bills. And you&rsquo;ll do the same for them, all while praying for and encouraging one another. Three, it could be more affordable than what you&rsquo;re paying now.

<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/accountability/political-ethics/step-aside-hillary-joe-biden-may-become-king-email-scandals-new"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/accountability/political-ethics/step-aside-hillary-joe-biden-may-become-king-email-scandals-new</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step aside Hillary, Joe Biden may become king of email scandals as new stash alarms investigators</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Archives&rsquo; stunning admission that it has located 82,000 pages of potentially government-related emails from Joe Biden&rsquo;s private accounts not only threatens to supplant Hillary Clinton in the annals of email scandals, it could also provide a boon to the ongoing federal and congressional investigations into the Biden family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The admission came out Monday as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit brought by the non-profit Southeastern Legal Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We're duty bound to make sure that everybody's following the law here. And it sure looks like that's questionable at this moment,&rdquo; Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., a member of the House Oversight Committee that is conducting the Biden impeachment inquiry right now, said hours after the revelation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry told the John Solomon Reports podcast that lawmakers in Congress must take action to ensure all the emails are preserved given the history of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s team trying to delete her private emails or to destroy the devices they were stored on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who first raised questions about President Biden&rsquo;s use of private email years ago, said the discovery of the emails should be combed for potential evidence by every investigator from Congress to the Justice Department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under legal pressure, the National Archives has confirmed to a court that it has located 82,000 pages of emails that Biden sent or received during his vice presidential tenure on three private pseudonym accounts. It&rsquo;s a total that potentially dwarfs the amount that landed Hillary Clinton in hot water a decade ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total of Biden private email exchanges was disclosed Monday in a little-noticed status report filed in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought against the National Archives and Records Administration by the nonprofit public interest law firm the Southeastern Legal Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation brought the lawsuit seeking access to the emails after Just the News revealed a year ago that Joe Biden had used three pseudonym email accounts &ndash; during the time he served as President Barack Obama&rsquo;s vice president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status report filed Monday in a federal court in Atlanta was the first to provide an estimate of the size and scope of possible government business conducted through Joe Biden&rsquo;s private email accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, there is no indication from the National Archives in the court case that any of Biden&rsquo;s email contain classified information. However, the president is under criminal investigation by Special Counsel Robert Hur for taking classified documents from his time as vice president and as a senator and storing them in insecure locations in the garage of his Delaware home and a think tank office he kept in Washington D.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hur recently spent two days interview Biden in that investigation. President Donald Trump has already been indicted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for mishandling classified documents the FBI recovered from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida or that Trump returned to the Archives belatedly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry said he will be inquiring whether the FBI or DOJ has ever reviewed the Biden email stash located by the National Archives for relevant criminal investigations involving Hunter Biden or Biden&rsquo;s handling of classified information and whether prosecutors ever considered charges for possible violations of the Federal Records Act.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Federal Agency Makes New Student Loan Proposal Months After Supreme Court Order</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration appeared to make major changes to its new student loan relief plan after the initial plan was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the Department of Education (DOE) released a draft text that showed that the narrower plan would allow student debt forgiveness to apply only to specific groups of students rather than being a blanket rule that would cancel debt for some 45 million borrowers under the original plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first student loan proposal, announced by President Joe Biden, would have promised up to $20,000 in debt relief for low- and middle-income individuals. The Supreme Court struck that down in June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOE has yet to release the full details of the plan, saying that it wants to cancel some or all student debt for borrowers whose balances exceed what they originally owed; those who have loans that entered repayment 25 or more years ago; those who used loans to attend career-training programs that led to &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; debt loads or insufficient earnings; or those who are eligible for other loan forgiveness programs but did not apply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fifth group is also being discussed, or &ldquo;those who are experiencing financial hardship that the current student loan system does not currently adequately address,&rdquo; the DOE said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft does not include details about how many borrowers would be impacted by the federal government's latest plan. It also did not include details about how much it may cost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOE stated it will continue to refine the proposal as it goes through a federal rulemaking process. The public will be able to provide written feedback next year. The draft proposal would give the department authority to wipe away federal student loans entirely for borrowers in some categories.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has canceled more than $120 billion in federal student loan debt via existing student loan forgiveness programs for specific individuals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the president called for a plan to help &ldquo;as many borrowers as possible,&rdquo; but his administration seems to be moving away from the type of mass cancellation that he promised in August 2022. That plan was estimated to cost $400 billion. It&rsquo;s unclear how much the second proposal will cost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/experts-claim-not-reading-mainstream-media-can-cause-heart-attacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/experts-claim-not-reading-mainstream-media-can-cause-heart-attacks/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Experts&rsquo; Claim Not Reading Mainstream Media Can Cause Heart Attacks</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Reading mainstream media and opting for alternative sources can cause heart attacks, according to new research reported by the mainstream media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, really.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a pilot study led by Manchester Metropolitan University, those who do not read legacy mainstream media and opt for alternative sources of information demonstrate unhealthy symptoms of physical and mental stress, which can lead to heart attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research study used so-called &ldquo;sophisticated techniques&rdquo; to monitor how people use media websites to measure their reactions to online information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers claimed people with a low ID have a flawed &lsquo;threat&rsquo; response when presented with misleading information in a stressful situation, which they say brings on cardiac responses and erratic reading behavior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study also found that participants with low IDs also lacked self-confidence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also claimed that reading alternative media from &ldquo;unverified&rdquo; sources (i.e., not reading CNN, MSNBC, BBC, ect) could negatively affect a person&rsquo;s health and well-being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Lecturer in Information and Communications at Manchester Metropolitan University and principal investigator on the study, Dr Geoff Walton, said:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Those who aren&rsquo;t very good at making judgments about information they read or see in newspapers, TV, or social media, especially misinformation such as fake news, experience a negative physical response to it. This means that misinformation is actually bad for their physical health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;On the other hand, those people that are very good at making judgments about information tend to have a much healthier physical response when they encounter misinformation,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/wDYNVH0U3cs"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Woman screams as Donald Trump is sworn in as President&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/wDYNVH0U3cs&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Woman screams as Donald Trump is sworn in as President</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play 0:00-0:10 - That was an example of the healthy response they may exhibit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Given the constant barrage of fake news that we come across every day of our lives, it clearly shows there is a worrying public health issue emerging.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;However, our previous research has shown that we can change this through teaching and training so that people get better at making judgments about misinformation such as fake news.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;By doing so, they will have a much better physical response, which will positively affect their well-being.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This shows it is now time for school teachers and lecturers to be given the right tools, devised in our previous research, to develop ID in their learners.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results will be presented at the European Conference on Information Literacy (ECIL) later this year. A peer-reviewed journal article is in preparation, and a larger study is planned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, a WHO study from 2022 claimed reading so-called &ldquo;misinformation&rdquo; can have a negative effect on health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official website of the WHO reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorrect interpretations of health information, which increase during outbreaks and disasters, often negatively impact people&rsquo;s mental health and increase vaccine hesitancy, and can delay the provision of health care, a new WHO review shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors conclude that the effects of infodemics and health misinformation online can be countered by &ldquo;developing legal policies, creating and promoting awareness campaigns, improving health-related content in mass media and increasing people&rsquo;s digital and health literacy&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The systematic review of published studies found 31 reviews that analysed fake news, misinformation, disinformation and infodemics related to health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misinformation was defined as false or inaccurate information deliberately intended to deceive, while disinformation also included misleading or biased information, manipulated narratives or facts, and propaganda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors gathered, compared, and summarized this evidence in order to identify ways to address the negative effects of false health information on public health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram are critical in disseminating the rapid and far-reaching spread of information,&rdquo; the systematic review explains.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The repercussions of misinformation on social media include such negative effects as &ldquo;an increase in erroneous interpretation of scientific knowledge, opinion polarization, escalating fear and panic or decreased access to health care&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased spread of health-related misinformation in a health emergency is accelerated by easy access to online content, especially on smartphones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;During crises such as infectious disease outbreaks and disasters, the overproduction of data from multiple sources, the quality of the information and the speed at which new information is disseminated create social and health-related impacts.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors found that social media have been propagating poor-quality health-related information during pandemics, humanitarian crises, and health emergencies at an increasing rate. They note, &ldquo;Such spreading of unreliable evidence on health topics amplifies vaccine hesitancy and promotes unproven treatments.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the more reason not to read mainstream media.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy reformation day everyone!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start off with world news today&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/iran-proxies-strikes-against-us-troops-middle-east-israel"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/iran-proxies-strikes-against-us-troops-middle-east-israel</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Iranian proxies continue attacks against US troops in Middle East following US strikes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iranian proxy forces have continued conducting attacks against U.S. troops in Syria and Iraq following last week's U.S. strikes against two facilities linked to Iranian forces in Syria.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Oct. 17 to Oct. 30, U.S. and coalition forces have been attacked at least 14 times at al Asad Air Base in Iraq and nine times at al Tanf garrison in Syria via a mix of one-way attack drones and rockets for a total of 23 attacks to date, a senior defense official told reporters on Monday. The total demonstrated an increase from late last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Many of these attacks were successfully disrupted by our military," the official said. "Most failed to reach their targets thanks to our robust defenses."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military in eastern Syria targeted two facilities used by Iran&rsquo;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps last Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The President has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today&rsquo;s action to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests,&rdquo; Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the facilities the U.S. targeted was a "weapons storage area," while the other was "an ammunition storage area," according to a senior military official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-one U.S. service members were injured, albeit not severely, at the two air bases between Oct. 17 and Oct. 18. A U.S. contractor died after suffering cardiac arrest when an early warning system detected another possible threat, leading to people scrambling for shelter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. leaders, President Joe Biden included, have urged Iran not to escalate or involve itself with Israel's war with Hamas. Hamas, which is a U.S.-designated Iran-supported terrorist organization based in Gaza, carried out an unprecedented terrorist attack on Oct. 7 that killed roughly 1,400 people, the vast majority of whom were civilians. The carnage included families being butchered, civilians burned alive, torture, sexual violence, and more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iran has forcefully spoken out against Israel's military response in Gaza, threatening to get involved in the conflict.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iranian Foreign Minister spoke in New York at the United Nations last week, where he warned the U.S. of "uncontrollable consequences" regarding its support for Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden has reinforced the country's presence in the Middle East to attempt to deter Iranian aggression, though the continued attacks indicate that their bolstered presence may not be having the impact the president had hoped.</span></p>

<p><strong>'Lynch Mob' Storms Airport in Russia Searching for Jews Arriving From Tel Aviv</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some scary news coming out of Dagestan, Russia, right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was what reports have described as a "lynch mob" storming the airport in Dagestan and chanting "Allahu Akbar," waving Palestinian flags and looking for Jews who they believed had arrived on a plane from Tel Aviv, Israel. Dagestan is a Muslim area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also reports that the mob stopped police cars in front searching for Jews, as well as a bus full of children that they assumed were Israeli children. In videos shared on X, you can see them storm the terminal, and even make their way out onto the Tar-Mac, and demanded to know if any Jews were on planes on the Tar-Mac.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The airport employee in the vest and green hat says there are no passengers on that plane.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mob started grilling people as to whether they were Jews and asking for passports. A&nbsp; poor gentleman in one of the videos insisted he wasn't Jewish&mdash;that he was Uzbek&mdash;but they didn't believe him and demanded that he show his passport.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were also allegedly looking for Jews in the cars around the airport and this footage allegedly shows them trying to flip a police car that dared to get in their way:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ria Novosti, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is warning the mob they are on video, that order will be established and they will be identified and "face criminal liability."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jerusalem Post said that the plane they were looking for was diverted to another airport, but the rioters went there as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to N12, the pilots were warned of the mob and rerouted the plane to land at a nearby airport. The rioters reached that one as well. The flight staff ordered the locking of all aircraft exits, while security forces closed the area off. Russian aviation authority said all aircraft were diverted to other airports. A security source said that a small number of Israelis and Jews were secured in the airport, and were set to be evacuated to Moscow "at the earliest convenience."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is happening as antisemitism is on the rise in Russia, as evidenced by a Jewish cultural center that was set on fire in the neighboring republic of Nalchik and graffitied with the inscription "Death to the Jews."</span></p>

<p><strong>Czech Defence Minister Calls for Country to Leave U.N. for &lsquo;Cheering&rsquo; Hamas Terrorists</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Czech Defence Minister Jana Černochov&aacute; has called for her country to leave the United Nations in response to the international body&rsquo;s failure to condemn Hamas terrorists for the slaughter of civilians in Israel on the October 7th attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to demand a &ldquo;ceasefire&rdquo; between Israel and Hamas as Jerusalem was preparing for its invasion of Gaza to root out the Islamist terror organisation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just 14 nations opposed the measure, including Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Fiji, Guatemala, Hungary, Israel, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga and the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, multiple attempts from the United States and others to pass a resolution to condemn the Hamas attacks were thwarted at the U.N. by China and Russia, who used their veto power as permanent members of the Security Council to block the condemnation of the terrorist group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to the apparent anti-Israel bias at the U.N. on Saturday, Czech Defence Minister Jana Černochov&aacute; said: &ldquo;In my opinion, the Czech Republic has no place in an organisation that cheers on terrorists and does not respect the fundamental right to self-defence,&rdquo; declaring: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Exactly three weeks ago, Hamas murdered over 1,400 Israelis, more victims for their population than the militant Islamist organisation al-Qaeda murdered in the US on 9/11. And only 14 countries, including ours, have spoken out clearly and understandably against this unprecedented terrorist attack perpetrated by Hamas terrorists! I am ashamed of the U.N.,&rdquo; Černochov&aacute; continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Czech Defence Minister doubled down on her condemnations of the United Nations on Sunday, writing that the presence of hostile nations such as Iran and Russia, as well as states which violate human rights such as Afghanistan, North Korea and Syria, undermines the U.N. charter and therefore the very purpose of the institution itself. With China and Russia having a veto over expelling any nation from the international body, the process is meaningless, Černochov&aacute; argued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What is the use of an organisation that cannot use even the few principles and possibilities it has and cannot apply them without the consent of the dictators?&rdquo; she questioned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conservative politician said that if the U.N. is incapable of making reforms to be able to condemn terrorists or expel rogue nations &ldquo;it has lost its role as a peacemaker&rdquo;. Therefore, she said, the world needs &ldquo;a new international organisation&rdquo; based upon on &ldquo;modern principles&rdquo; such as the elimination of veto powers granted to dictatorships and the end of &ldquo;sponsoring terrorists.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Czech defence chief concluded by saying that she had &ldquo;often wondered&rdquo; about how the world refused to believe the horrors committed in concentration camps by Nazi Germany during World War II but said that perhaps &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t the case at all,&rdquo; saying that rather than refusing to believe the atrocities &ldquo;a part of society apparently wanted to get rid of the Jews.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Anti-Semitism has spread deeply throughout the world, including the United Nations. They trust terrorists, but they don&rsquo;t trust the country that has been protecting our Western civilisation&rsquo;s ass for many years in the Middle East. Absurd world,&rdquo; Černochov&aacute; said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is completely incomprehensible to me that no one is calling for a fundamental reform of the organisation, which long ago turned from a peacemaker into a hammer against Israel.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>California&rsquo;s Gun Ban Allowed to Continue by Appeals Court</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A U.S. appeals court has allowed California&rsquo;s ban on certain types of semi-automatic rifles, so-called assault weapons, to remain in effect, reversing an earlier lower court decision to stay the law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semi-automatic rifles have been restricted in the state since 1989, with the law updated multiple times to keep the ban in effect. On Oct. 19, U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez in San Diego ruled that the ban was a violation of Second Amendment rights and issued an injunction that blocked its enforcement in the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An appeal against the ruling was filed by California Attorney General Rob Bonta.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Oct. 28, a panel of three judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the injunction issued by Judge Benitez, thereby allowing the weapon ban to take effect in the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By a 2&ndash;1 majority, the 9th Circuit panel stayed the judge's order, citing the full appeals court's finding in a similar case that the attorney general was likely to succeed on the merits and had shown that &ldquo;California would be irreparably harmed absent a stay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Bonta, a Democrat who called Judge Benitez's decision &ldquo;dangerous and misguided,&rdquo; welcomed the Oct. 28 9th Circuit order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Weapons of war do not belong on our streets,&rdquo; Mr. Bonta said, pointing to the mass shooting on Oct. 25&nbsp; in Lewiston, Maine, that claimed 18 lives and left 13 people wounded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1989, California became the first U.S. state to ban semi-automatic rifles, acting in the wake of a school shooting that killed five children, then toughened the law the following year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, California has restricted the manufacture, distribution, transportation, importation, sale, or possession of firearms that qualify under the law as &ldquo;assault weapons.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Benitez declared the same law unconstitutional in 2021. But the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit last year vacated his order and directed him to review the matter further.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Benitez, in September, also ruled California's ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines unconstitutional. But the 9th Circuit subsequently allowed that statute to remain in effect while the state appeals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a post on Facebook, nonprofit civil rights advocate Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) stated that even though the 9th Circuit has &ldquo;temporarily blocked our District Court victory, [the] good news is that the State&rsquo;s appeal has been expedited and it is likely that the merits panel, which hears the appeal, will be made up of different judges.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Once all briefs are filed, it is possible that the merits panel may order additional oral arguments,&rdquo; the group stated in the post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Oct. 19 ruling, Judge Benitez wrote that the U.S. Constitution made it clear that Americans have the right to decide what firearms they use for self-defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed out that the banned rifles use the same ammunition, perform the same functions, and fire at the same rate as rifles that haven't been prohibited. The legislators selected which firearms to ban based on how the guns looked, he wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Falling back on an old, recycled justification, the State says that its ban should stand because a person can have as many other rifles, shotguns, and pistols as one wants,&rdquo; Judge Benitez wrote in the ruling. "[However,] this is not the way American Constitutional rights work. It is not permissible for a state to ban some books simply because there are other books to read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In their normal configurations, the so-called &lsquo;assault weapons&rsquo; ... are modern firearms commonly owned by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes across the nation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, had criticized Judge Benitez&rsquo;s ruling, insisting that the judge is &ldquo;hellbent on making it more dangerous for our kids to go to school, for families to go to the mall, or to attend a place of worship,&rdquo; according to an Oct. 19 statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 9th Circuit&rsquo;s ruling to allow California&rsquo;s weapon ban to remain in effect comes as the Biden administration is pushing for stronger gun control regulations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the mass shooting in Maine that killed 18 people, President Biden said in an Oct. 26 statement that while his administration has &ldquo;made progress on gun safety,&rdquo; such measures are &ldquo;simply not enough.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start today&rsquo;s show with tragic news coming out of Lewiston Maine, as a gun man shot and killed at least 18 people, and wounded 13 more&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/lewiston-maine-mass-shooting-october-26"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/lewiston-maine-mass-shooting-october-26</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine State Police have released a detailed timeline of the mass shooting in Lewiston that killed at least 18 people and injured 13 more at two separate locations Wednesday night as the manhunt for suspect Robert Card intensified across the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 6:56 p.m., the Auburn Communications Center was alerted that an unidentified man walked into Just-In-Time Bowling, which was recently renamed from Sparetime Recreation, on Mollison Street in Lewiston and began shooting. Police said multiple 911 calls that followed confirmed the shooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 7:08 p.m., the Auburn Communications Center received multiple calls that a man had entered a Bar and Grille Restaurant on Lincoln Street and opened fire.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said multiple law enforcement agencies and emergency medical personnel were immediately dispatched to the locations, which are about 4 miles apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 8:06 pm, police released a photo of the alleged shooter to the media. The surveillance photo showed a man wearing a brown sweatshirt and holding a rifle while walking through doors decorated with bowling pins and a bowling ball.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 9:26 p.m., the Lewiston Police Department received a call identifying the man in the distributed photos as Robert Card, 40, of Bowdoin, Maine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 9:56 p.m., the Lisbon Police Department notified Lewiston Police that it had located a white Subaru at the at a Boat Launch in Lisbon. The vehicle was confirmed to belong to Card.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card remains at large as more than 350 law enforcement personnel from federal, state and local agencies continue to search for him. Authorities stress that Card should be considered armed and dangerous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card is a "trained firearms instructor" who recently reported mental health issues,including "hearing voices and threats to shoot up the National Guard Base in Saco, ME," according to a Maine law enforcement bulletin shared with Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card is also a Petroleum Supply Specialist in the Army Reserve, having enlisted in December 2002, an Army spokesperson told Fox News, adding that Card has had no combat deployments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials have yet to publicly name any of the 18 victims, and police said Thursday morning 10 of the victims killed have yet to be identified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police have confirmed that seven people &mdash; one female and six males &mdash; were killed at the bowling alley, which was holding a youth league at the time of the shooting. Eight males were killed at the Bar and Grille. Three additional people died after first responders rushed them to Central Maine Medical Hospital in Lewiston.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional 13 people were injured in the shootings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 80 FBI agents are involved in the search for Robert Card, in addition to agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Coast Guard, according to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collins made the comments during a press conference on Thursday evening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I had a call from the deputy director of the FBI who told me that there were 80 FBI agents on site participating in the search for the killer," Collins said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local law enforcement agencies are also searching for Card.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we move on, I want to ask that you be praying for the community of Lewiston Maine today&hellip; pray that the Lord would be near the broken hearted as is promised in His word&hellip; that He would bind up their wounds, and grant comfort and peace to those who are grieving the loss of loved ones. Be praying that the Lord would be with local leaders in Maine, both political and law enforcement&hellip; and that justice would be served on the one responsible for this heinous crime, and tragic loss of life.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Johnson begins House speakership with focus on debt, inflation, &lsquo;border catastrophe&rsquo; as top issues</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the newly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives kicked off his leadership role on Wednesday with a commitment to establish a fiscal commission dedicated to rolling back excessive government spending as a way to reduce inflation. He also called on the Senate and White House to stop ignoring the &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; at the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson described the nation&rsquo;s rising $33 trillion national debt as the greatest threat to national security and connected it to the level of inflation that America&rsquo;s families have been grappling with the last few years.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Aircraft Carriers And Marines Are On The Move Towards Iran&rsquo;s &lsquo;Military Backyard&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation in Israel continues to be tense as the Israeli Defense Forces are on standby to launch a large-scale ground invasion of Gaza. As of now, Tel Aviv has agreed to hold off invading until the U.S. military puts more forces in the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Israeli Air Force is pounding hundreds of targets within Gaza, killing and wounding hundreds of Hamas terrorists and Palestinian civilians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other end, Hamas continues to be defiant, launching missiles and small-scale attacks against Israel. The terrorist group also holds scores of hostages and is threatening to execute them if Israel invades.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the German newspaper Bild, the Israelis won&rsquo;t hold back a possible ground invasion of Gaza over the issue of the hostages. Hamas is currently holding over 200 hostages and has been using them as deterrence against an Israeli ground invasion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with more than 1,400 Israelis killed and thousands more wounded, the Israeli government might very likely choose to go in and destroy Hamas despite what might happen to the hostages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Israeli Army is likely waiting for the air force to take out the most important targets before it rolls in with tanks and armored personnel carriers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, two more hostages were released this week as two elderly women, were released on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the women said, &ldquo;When we arrived in Gaza, they first told us that they believed in the Quran and would not harm us, they fed us well, were kind, a doctor and paramedic visited us regularly, everything was provided for us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But their experience leading up to their captivity in Gaza was traumatic. Hostages were beaten and humiliated as they were snatched from their homes in Israel to Gaza&rsquo;s underground tunnel complex.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the international military presence around Israel continues to grow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European countries are getting ready for forceful evacuations of their citizens from Israel and Lebanon. German and French special operations forces have set up camp in Cyprus and are on standby for contingencies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military has already sent two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region and the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), which is special operations capable. The Pentagon has also relocated a number of C-130 tactical transport aircraft and support personnel to Greece to be on standby for potential evacuation operations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far, Israel has been adamant that it doesn&rsquo;t want any direct military assistance or foreign boots on the ground. However, Tel Aviv was allowed a number of U.S. military advisors to support the Israeli Defense Forces. According to Axios, U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. James Glynn, a former commander of the Marine Forces Special Operations Command and with experience against the Islamic State, is leading the advisory group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased presence of U.S. forces in the region is also in response to credible threats about U.S. citizens and facilities in the region.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to U.S. defense officials, the Pentagon assesses that state and non-state actors in the region&mdash;mainly Iran&mdash;are considering escalating the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hamas into a wider regional conflict.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military is ready to counter any hostile actions in the area. Whether Iran understands the danger is another thing.</span></p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;Office&rsquo; Alums Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey: No News on a Reboot (Yet)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Office&rdquo; is one of the most streamed sitcoms around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show, spun from the British version created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, aired on NBC for nine seasons. The workplace comedy nearly got canceled after its first year, but it found its creative footing and became a modern TV classic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show said goodbye in 2013, with cast members like Steve Carell and John Krasinski drawing raves for follow-up projects like &ldquo;Foxcatcher&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Quiet Place,&rdquo; respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Puck News reports show runner Greg Daniels is prepping an &ldquo;Office&rdquo; reboot. That&rsquo;s news to show alums Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, AKA the hosts of the popular &ldquo;Office Ladies&rdquo; podcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two discussed a possible show return via their podcast, throwing some cold water on the possibility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We get asked all the time, there are always these rumors of another American version [of &lsquo;The Office&rsquo;],&rdquo; Fischer said in the latest episode of &ldquo;Office Ladies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Like a reboot or a remake or a spinoff.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No one has ever in all of these years &hellip; contacted me about being on another version of &lsquo;The Office.&rsquo; Or any cast member,&rdquo; said Fischer, who played receptionist Pam Beesly on the series. &ldquo;Whenever I talk to the cast members., &lsquo;never heard of anything. Not a word.'&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Do we need a 50-year-old Pam sitting at a desk at Dunder Mifflin?&rdquo;&nbsp; referring to turning that age next year. One cast member should definitely be invited back, she suggested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I like the idea that Creed still works there .. he comes down from the ceiling at night,&rdquo; Fischer said of the mercurial character played by ex-rocker Creed Bratton.</span></p>]]></description>
