<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/us/politics/trump-colorado-ballot-14th-amendment.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/us/politics/trump-colorado-ballot-14th-amendment.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trump Is Disqualified From 2024 Ballot, Colorado Court Says in Explosive Ruling</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Colorado&rsquo;s top court ruled on Tuesday that President Donald J. Trump is disqualified from holding office again because he engaged in insurrection with his actions leading up to the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol, an explosive ruling that is likely to put the basic contours of the 2024 election in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Colorado Supreme Court was the first in the nation to find that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment &mdash; which disqualifies people who engage in insurrection against the Constitution after taking an oath to support it &mdash; applies to Mr. Trump, an argument that his opponents have been making around the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The ruling directs the Colorado secretary of state to exclude Mr. Trump&rsquo;s name from the state&rsquo;s Republican primary ballot. It does not address the general election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We do not reach these conclusions lightly,&rdquo; a four-justice majority wrote, with three justices dissenting. &ldquo;We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr. Trump&rsquo;s campaign said immediately that it would appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Colorado justices anticipated that likelihood by putting their ruling on hold at least until Jan. 4; if Mr. Trump appeals before then, the hold will continue until the Supreme Court rules. And while Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling applies only to one state, it could all but force the nation&rsquo;s highest court to decide the question for all 50.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for me to see how they don&rsquo;t take this one, because this certainly seems to be one of those questions that requires some national resolution,&rdquo; said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University who has closely followed the Colorado case and related lawsuits around the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">If the justices take up the case, it will join a pile of other Trump-related matters they have agreed or are likely to decide, including whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for actions he took in office and the scope of an obstruction charge that is central to his federal Jan. 6 case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The U.S. Supreme Court has a 6-to-3 conservative majority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself, and it is already under extraordinary political pressure and scrutiny both for its rulings and its justices&rsquo; ethics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Once again, the Supreme Court is being thrust into the center of a U.S. presidential election,&rdquo; said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, who compared the stakes to Bush v. Gore. &ldquo;But, unlike in 2000, the general political instability in the United States makes the situation now much more precarious.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the Colorado court&rsquo;s lengthy ruling on Tuesday, the justices there reversed a Denver district judge&rsquo;s finding last month that Section 3 did not apply to the presidency. They affirmed the district judge&rsquo;s other key conclusions: that Mr. Trump&rsquo;s actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, constituted engaging in insurrection, and that courts had the authority to enforce Section 3 against a person whom Congress had not specifically designated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;A majority of the court holds that President Trump is disqualified from holding the office of president under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution,&rdquo; the justices wrote. &ldquo;Because he is disqualified, it would be a wrongful act under the Election Code for the Colorado secretary of state to list him as a candidate on the presidential primary ballot.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr. Trump&rsquo;s campaign denounced the ruling, which is likely to inflame a Republican base that he has primed to see the array of civil and criminal cases against him as a witch hunt. Politically, his standing among Republican primary voters has only risen in the wake of the dozens of criminal charges against him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Unsurprisingly, the all-Democrat appointed Colorado Supreme Court has ruled against President Trump, supporting a Soros-funded, left-wing group&rsquo;s scheme to interfere in an election on behalf of Crooked Joe Biden by removing President Trump&rsquo;s name from the ballot and eliminating the rights of Colorado voters to vote for the candidate of their choice,&rdquo; a campaign spokesman, Steven Cheung, said. &ldquo;We have full confidence that the U.S. Supreme Court will quickly rule in our favor and finally put an end to these un-American lawsuits.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Similar lawsuits in Minnesota and New Hampshire were dismissed on procedural grounds. A judge in Michigan ruled last month that the issue was political and not for him to decide, and an appeals court affirmed the decision not to disqualify Mr. Trump there. The plaintiffs have appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling &ldquo;is not only historic and justified, but is necessary to protect the future of democracy in our country,&rdquo; Noah Bookbinder, the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in a statement. His organization represented the voters seeking to disqualify Mr. Trump in Colorado.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr. Trump himself, who has routinely railed against unfavorable rulings, did not explicitly mention the Colorado Supreme Court decision in a speech Tuesday evening in Waterloo, Iowa &mdash; but his campaign was already fund-raising off it. An email to his supporters accused Democrats of trying to &ldquo;nullify&rdquo; Trump votes and asked for contributions to help defend his place on ballots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Republican elected officials quickly circled the wagons around Mr. Trump, and a super PAC supporting him blasted out some of their comments to supporters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In one more illustration of the unusual nature of the 2024 Republican primary race &mdash; in which even the candidates seeking to defeat Mr. Trump for the party&rsquo;s nomination have largely shied away from condemning him &mdash; his main rivals, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, both suggested that the ruling was an abuse of judicial power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The case hinged on several questions: Was it an insurrection when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election? If so, did Mr. Trump engage in that insurrection through his messages to his supporters beforehand, his speech that morning and his Twitter posts during the attack? Do courts have the authority to enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment without congressional action? And does Section 3 apply to the presidency?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Again, an explosive ruling that is likely to put the basic contours of the 2024 election in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/21/at-least-11-dead-in-prague-shooting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/21/at-least-11-dead-in-prague-shooting/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>At Least 15 Dead in Prague Shooting.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At least 15 people have been reported dead and injured in a shooting incident at Charles University&rsquo;s Faculty of Arts located near the Old Town, a major tourist hub within the city, as per the official statement from Prague police. The horrific event unraveled at this educational facility in the capital city of the Czech Republic, erupting fear and panic among students and faculty present at the scene. Local authorities confirmed the shooter&rsquo;s elimination shortly after the attack, while refraining from revealing exactly how many victims were impacted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Eyewitness reports and visual evidence posted on social media depicted the terrifying scene on the university campus, with sirens blaring and police vehicles flooding the streets around the building. Videos on social media platforms showed bystanders looking visibly panicked and attempting to escape the premises. Prague police issued a plea, urging residents to stay away from the area and to remain indoors for safety reasons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Jakob Weizman, a journalist sheltering inside a darkened classroom, shared his experience on social media: &ldquo;Currently stuck inside my classroom in Prague. Shooter is dead, but we&rsquo;re waiting to be evacuated. Praying to make it out alive,&rdquo; he wrote. He later added, &ldquo;Locked the door before the shooter tried to open it. F&mdash;ing hell.&rdquo; Yet another social media user furnished the world with a chilling image of what appeared to be students desperately huddled on the university building&rsquo;s scaffolding, emphasizing the level of fear and panic induced by the tragic event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.eurasiantimes.com/game-on-with-china-us-to-restore-tinian-airfield-once-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.eurasiantimes.com/game-on-with-china-us-to-restore-tinian-airfield-once-home/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Game-On With China! US To Restore Tinian Airfield Once Home To Largest B-29 Bomber Fleet During WWII</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">US Air Force General Kenneth Wilsbach shared this development in a discussion with Asia Nikkei, revealing that the military branch is increasing construction efforts at Tinian North Airfield and Tinian International Airfield.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This effort is a crucial component of a broader initiative to disperse aircraft strategically across the Indo-Pacific region, responding to the escalating missile threat posed by China.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;If you pay attention in the next few months, you will see significant progress, especially at Tinian North,&rdquo; Wilsbach said. During World War II, the Tinian North Airfield served as the operational base for the largest B-29 bomber fleet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Describing the airfield as having extensive pavement hidden beneath an overgrown jungle, he revealed plans to clear the jungle between now and summertime. The goal is to transform the site into a comprehensive facility upon completion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tinian, positioned approximately 200 kilometers north of Guam within the Northern Mariana Islands, is undergoing a revitalization in line with the US Air Force&rsquo;s operational strategy, Agile Combat Employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This strategic approach, a departure from post-Cold War era tactics, involves deliberately relocating aircraft to various sites across the western Pacific. The primary goal is to mitigate vulnerability to potential enemy missile strikes during periods of crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As documents released in March revealed, as part of the Air Force&rsquo;s 2024 budget request, several projects are outlined for Tinian, seeking a budget allocation of US$78 million for the fiscal year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Among these projects is an airfield development initiative encompassing the demolition of World War II-era airfield pavements, clearing and leveling surfaces, and installing drainage, utilities, and secure fencing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Another project focuses on establishing a fuel-pipeline system involving the installation of storage tanks, pipes, and safety equipment to facilitate fuel unloading from ships for transport to the airfield via pipeline and truck.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Additionally, a parking-apron project is detailed, which aims to pave areas designated for aircraft parking and taxiways. The taxiways must adhere to the Pentagon&rsquo;s standards for ground control operations for large-frame aircraft, as specified in the documents.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The proposed apron size would accommodate up to 12 KC-135 and KC-46 tanker aircraft and the necessary fueling equipment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tinian currently houses one international airfield, while Tinian North Airfield, once the most extensive B-29 base during World War II, lies largely concealed by jungle growth. However, the runways and taxiways remain intact.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tinian was captured from Japanese control by US forces in the summer of 1944, toward the end of World War II. The northern expanse of the island hosted a substantial and historically momentous airfield, famously recognized as North Field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This airfield played a crucial role in Operation Silverplate, serving as the departure point for two specially modified B-29 bombers on separate sorties, marking the sole operational use of nuclear weapons to date.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Beyond these historic missions, North Field was instrumental as the launch site for many bomber and reconnaissance flights conducted over Japan and across the Western Pacific during the latter phases of the war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the aftermath of World War II, the airfield witnessed a substantial deterioration in maintenance, resulting in the decline of its expansive parallel runways, aprons, and supporting infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The US Air Force is now intensifying its endeavors to enhance the airfield&rsquo;s capabilities to accommodate fighter jets, bombers, and significant support aircraft. These expanded capabilities align with the standards commonly met by the nearby Andersen Air Force Base on Guam.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, the US believes that if Andersen Air Force Base faces disruption due to enemy actions, notably those from China, or natural disasters, this facility on Tinian would be crucial in ensuring continuity and resilience in US military operations in the Pacific region.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/12/20/celebrity-news/hulk-hogan-70-gets-baptized-surrenders-to-jesus-greatest-day-of-my-life/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://pagesix.com/2023/12/20/celebrity-news/hulk-hogan-70-gets-baptized-surrenders-to-jesus-greatest-day-of-my-life/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hulk Hogan, 70, gets baptized, &lsquo;surrenders&rsquo; to Jesus: &lsquo;Greatest day of my life&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">WWE icon Hulk Hogan has been baptized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">His ceremony took place at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Florida, as noted by the social media slideshow he shared Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life,&rdquo; the 70-year-old star captioned the post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;No worries, no hate, no judgment&hellip; only love!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hogan&rsquo;s slideshow included a video of him and his wife, Sky Daily Hogan, submerging themselves in a pool of water and resurfacing with huge grins on their faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">They were both garbed with white clothing, with the former pro wrestler rocking his signature bandana and a gold cross necklace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A photo included at the end of the post appeared to show Hulk and Sky, plus others, bowing their heads in prayer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Indian Rocks Baptist Church took to its Instagram Story to celebrate the &ldquo;Hogan Knows Best&rdquo; alum&rsquo;s special moment.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Kamala Harris launches 'Reproductive Freedoms' pro-abortion tour across US</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Vice President Kamala Harris announced Tuesday that she plans to travel around the United States in what she calls a "Reproductive Freedoms" tour. Harris announced that these trips will be taken "to organize, build community, and fight back" against what she calls a "full-on attack on a woman's fundamental freedom to make decisions about her own body" across the nation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The pro-abortion tour will kick off in Wisconsin on Jan. 22, which marks the 51st anniversary of the now-overturned Roe v. Wade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The White House promises that "Vice President Harris will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban," although it does not specify what those consequences may be.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Britain BANS PRAYER Near Abortion Clinics.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">England&rsquo;s High Court has upheld a local government order establishing a so-called &ldquo;buffer zone&rdquo; against prayers being said near an abortion clinic. Livia Tossici-Bolt, who heads the pro-life group 40 Days for Life Bournemouth, and Christian Concern had attempted to overturn the ban, arguing it &ldquo;criminalized prayer and reading from the Bible&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Judges determined on Friday that the banning order &ldquo;lawfully followed the democratic and consultative procedures&rdquo;. They said any infringements of freedom of religion, speech, and the right to protest were &ldquo;justified by the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of women attending the clinic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Christian Concern intends to appeal the decision. &ldquo;Peaceful witness near abortion centers are helpful to many women in crisis pregnancies, offering genuine choice by providing support,&rdquo; argued Christian Legal Centre chief executive Andrea Williams. British police are exceptionally rigid in enforcing &ldquo;buffer zones&rdquo; protecting abortionists. Lone Christians have in some cases been arrested or fined for praying silently inside their heads near clinics.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden border crisis shatters record with 14,509 illegal immigrants encountered in one day</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">U.S. border officials encountered the highest number of illegal immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border on Monday than any day, upending all other records that the Biden administration has set over the past three years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Washington Examiner obtained internal U.S. Customs and Border Protection data Tuesday that revealed 14,509 immigrants were encountered by federal law enforcement at the southern border on Monday. The large majority of encounters were of immigrants who walked around the port of entry and crossed into the country illegally, while a small percentage tried to enter at the port of entry but were denied admission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The most recent record of 12,000 was set last week, according to Fox News. If yesterday's rate of 14,509 arrests per day continued for a month, it would translate to more than 435,000 immigrant arrests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX), whose district runs along 800 miles of the 2,000-mile border, described the situation in his region as "all very sad." Gonzales told the Washington Examiner in a text message Tuesday morning that he believes the situation in Eagle Pass, Texas, a border town where 2,500 immigrants were arrested on Sunday, will continue to decline but that the extent would depend on how the Biden administration responds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Depends on how much pressure gets put on U.S. and Mexican officials," Gonzales wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-TN) reacted to the new one-day record on X, formerly Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Another Record: Over 14,500 illegal immigrants have been encountered while entering our country," Green wrote. "This has been the single worst 24 hours for our Southwest border in our nation&rsquo;s history."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Border officials in the Eagle Pass-Del Rio region encountered 3,100 illegal immigrants Monday, while officials in the Tucson region of Arizona encountered 3,089 people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Government numbers obtained Tuesday show 26,758 immigrants were in custody as of Tuesday morning, including 5,197 in Del Rio, Texas; 5,004 in Tucson, Arizona; 4,968 in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; and 4,722 in El Paso, Texas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Existing Border Patrol stations in the Eagle Pass area are too small to accommodate more than several hundred people, so immigrants are being processed at a large tent facility outside town known as "Firefly" for the road that it is located on. The tent facility was set up last year with the intent of holding up to 1,000 immigrants, but as of Tuesday, more than 3,000 immigrants were at the site &mdash; putting the facility three times over the legal limit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Border Patrol is also busing immigrants to other regions for processing. One official at the tent facility told the Washington Examiner that it sends out 30 to 50 large buses of immigrants to other regions each day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Border Patrol highway checkpoints, including the only one north of Eagle Pass, were shuttered this week as agents were pulled to transport and process migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden has yet to react to the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/germany-begins-deploying-troops-for-first-time-since-world-war-ii/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/germany-begins-deploying-troops-for-first-time-since-world-war-ii/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Germany Begins Deploying Troops for First Time since World War II</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The announcement was made on Monday in Lithuania, where Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas met Boris Pistoriusto to outline a &ldquo;Roadmap Action Plan&rdquo; involving 4,800 permanently stationed German soldiers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The new move was described as &ldquo;historical&rdquo; for both nations and NATO.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">German troops will be stationed in the Lithuanian cities of Kaunas and Vilnius in early 2024, with the majority of troops being deployed in 2025 and 2026 and full-operation capability expected by 2027.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile, Lithuania committed to providing all necessary civilian and military infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The German commitment of permanently stationing a brigade in Lithuania is a historical step for both Germany and Lithuania,&rdquo; Anusauskas said Monday, according to a press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We are turning over to a page of even deeper strategic partnership.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Pistorius noted the step as being positive for defense relations, considering the war between Ukraine and Russia,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">We will ensure reliable deterrence, and we will be ready to [defend] NATO. We are sending a clear signal with this step to those who present a threat to peace and security in Europe.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Newsweek reported that experts within the two defense ministries formulated the plan:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Most of the German troops will be stationed in the territory of Rūdninkai military training ground, while the rest will be deployed in the town of Rukla, where some 1,000 allied troops already reside.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Logistical hubs will cater to the new brigade, including three maneuver battalions and combat support and supply units formed by new and existing units.&ldquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The 203rd Panzer Battalion, based in North Rhine-Westphalia, and the 122nd Armored Infantry Battalion, based in Bavaria, will be moved to Lithuania. Lithuania&rsquo;s enhanced Forward Presence Battalion Battle Group will be transformed into a multinational battalion to become &ldquo;an integral part of the brigade,&rdquo; the release said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The head of the parliamentary National Security and Defense Committee, Laurynas Kasciunas, said the country would allocate 0.3 percent of its gross domestic product to help fund the deployment and to build housing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Earlier this year, Germany faced pressure from the US to provide Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2023/12/18/americans-yawn-at-cdc-warnings-about-tripledemic-n4924835"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2023/12/18/americans-yawn-at-cdc-warnings-about-tripledemic-n4924835</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Americans Yawn at CDC Warnings About 'Tripledemic'</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While America's public health officials issue one warning after another about this winter's "tripledemic" of COVID, flu, and RSV, the American public is responding with a collective yawn &mdash; if vaccination rates are anything to go by.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The CDC's most recent weekly vaccination update says that "receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine is low across all socio-demographic subgroups and has consistently varied by age, race and ethnicity, poverty status, health insurance status, and urbanicity." As of December 2, fewer than 18% of adults reported getting the updated COVID-19 vaccine since Sept. 14, and about another 15% of adults said they would "definitely" get vaccinated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">RSV &mdash; respiratory syncytial virus infection &mdash; is another one of those bugs that poses its most serious risk to the 60-and-over crowd. Although a serious RSV infection might require hospitalization, the uptake rate among the eligible 60-plus cohort is just 16%.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Vaccinations for the ordinary flu are down a bit, too. "Adult vaccination rates for influenza reached their peak for the 2020-2021 cycle," the Washington Examiner reported on Monday, "with 50.2% of those over 18 getting vaccinated. For the 2022-2023 season, however, only 46.9% of the same population obtained their shot." Rates are expected to be about the same or lower for the current 2023-2024 flu season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The drop isn't huge but the trendline is clear: Americans don't seem to be all that worried about the flu &mdash; and aren't concerned at all about COVID or RSV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That's not for any lack of effort on the part of our public health system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The CDC began its big vaccination push more than two months ago, with this tragically hip tweet from CDC director Mandy Cohen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Chicago health officials took a more traditional (and much less wince-inducing) approach on Monday, with Dr. Colleen Nash, associate professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Rush University Medical Center, warning, "We&rsquo;ve now been lucky enough to kind of live with COVID but still enjoy normal life and activities and things. And that is directly attributable, at least in part, to vaccinations. So I would really encourage people to do that if they haven&rsquo;t already."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While reports show that Illinois' hospitalization rate for COVID is "ticking up," the actual numbers aren't anything like 2020, with an additional 1,251 COVID hospital admissions this week statewide. And yet according to the Chicago Tribune, only about 11% of city residents are fully up to date on their COVID vaccinations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The CDC tried on Twitter/X again on Saturday, reminding readers, "&lsquo;Tis the season for joy and family. Now is the time to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and flu before you see your loved ones again."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Visit vaccines.gov to find vaccines near you."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The ratio, as the kids like to say, is epic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While the replies were all over the place in tone, this one reasonable-sounding tweet captured the general sentiment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">When vaccination rates are down even for the innocuous (and generally trusted) flu shot, it's clear that the CDC no longer enjoys the clout it used to with the American public.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Navy vet defends beheading Iowa capitol's satanic Baphomet statue: 'Christian civil disobedience'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Mississippi Navy reserve pilot instructor who admitted to beheading a statue of the satanic half-man, half-goat Baphomet inside the Iowa State Capitol told Fox News he was simply engaging in "Christian civil disobedience."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Cassidy said he decided "spur of the moment" to travel north to Des Moines and take action against the statue, which had been permitted to be erected not far from the rotunda's Nativity display for Christmas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told "Jesse Watters Primetime" he wrecked the statue then went straight to Capitol security to tell them what he did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I wasn't running away or anything like that. I told them what I did," he said, thanking law enforcement for their professionalism following the incident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was cited for criminal mischief in the fourth degree and released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I saw that this was going on, I was surprised that the legislature allowed it up and that they didn't do anything to take it down," Cassidy added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he wasn't sure what to expect when he came upon the Capitol, citing a prior incident in Springfield, Ill., where groups were chanting after a 2021 erection of a satanic statue in the Illinois State House.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Tuesday statement, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said she found the statue "absolutely objectionable," but that the best response to objectionable speech is more speech and prayer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he was charged, several conservative figures rallied to Cassidy's defense, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and conservative commentator Matt Walsh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis promised to "chip in" for Cassidy's legal fees, writing on X, formerly Twitter, that "Satan has no place in our society and should not be recognized as a &lsquo;religion&rsquo; by the federal government." Walsh similarly tweeted he will contribute to Cassidy's defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Host Jesse Watters noted the contrast between reaction to Cassidy's act and the dozens of protests in recent years that featured left-wing activists tearing down statues of Confederate officers, former U.S. presidents and historical figures like Christopher Columbus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., dismissal of the crowd in her home neighborhood of Little Italy, Baltimore, who leveled the Columbus statue and tossed it in the Patapsco River.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People will do what they do," Pelosi said at a July 2020 press conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Richmond, Va., in recent years removed an entire street's worth of statuary dedicated to Confederate Gens. A. P. Hill, "Stonewall" Jackson and J. E. B. Stuart, all of which lined the former Confederate capital's "Monument Avenue" for decades.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left-wing protesters notably failed to topple the statue of Andrew Jackson, the first Democratic president, near the White House in 2020 after being rebuffed by law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that respect, Watters said there appears to be a dichotomy between what statuary destruction causes mainstream or left-wing outrage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassidy's attorney, Davis Younts, said his client's case is a question of good versus evil, and that he and those who have come to his defense will continue to stand by him to make sure he gets equal protection under law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said there has not yet been a First Amendment suit in case law that has found Satanism to be considered a religion under the Constitution, and that anti-blasphemy laws still exist in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/12/17/church-of-england-blesses-same-sex-couples-for-the-first-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/12/17/church-of-england-blesses-same-sex-couples-for-the-first-time/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Church of England Blesses Same-Sex Couples For the First Time</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Church of England priests offered officially sanctioned blessings of same-sex partnerships for the first time on Sunday, though a ban on church weddings for gay couples remains in place amid deep divisions within global Anglicanism over marriage and sexuality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of the first ceremonies, the Rev. Catherine Bond and the Rev. Jane Pearce had their union blessed at St John the Baptist church, in Felixstowe, eastern England, where both are associate priests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple knelt in front of Canon Andrew Dotchin, who held their heads as he gave &ldquo;thanks for Catherine and Jane, to the love and friendship they share, and their commitment to one another as they come before you on this day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The church&acute;s national assembly voted in February to allow clergy to bless the unions of same-sex couples who have had civil weddings or partnerships. The words used for the blessings, known as prayers of love and faith, were approved by the church&acute;s House of Bishops on Tuesday and used for the first time on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compromise was struck following five years of discussions about the church&acute;s position on sexuality. Church leaders offered an apology for the church&acute;s failure to welcome LGBTQ people, but also endorsed the doctrine that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. Clergy won&acute;t be required to perform same-sex blessings if they disagree with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blessings can be used in regular church services. The church&acute;s governing body has also drawn up a plan for separate &ldquo;services of prayer and dedication&rdquo; for same-sex couples that would resemble weddings, but it has not yet been formally approved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public opinion surveys consistently show that a majority of people in England support same-sex marriage, which has been legal since 2013. The church didn&acute;t alter its teaching on marriage when the law changed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said he won&acute;t personally bless any same-sex couples because it&acute;s his job to unify the world&rsquo;s 85 million Anglicans. Welby is the spiritual leader of both the Church of England and the global Anglican Communion of which it is a member.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Anglican bishops from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific said after the February decision that they no longer recognize Welby as their leader.</span></p>

<p><strong>Poll: 54% of Democrat Voters Want to Replace Joe Biden as 2024 Nominee</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat party voters are unhappy President Joe Biden, 81, is the presumptive Democrat nominee to likely challenge former President Donald Trump, Fox News polling revealed Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll highlights the disconnect and discord inflicting the Democrat party after Biden refused to step aside and allow a different Democrat to lead the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey showed:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">54 percent of Democrat primary voters prefer an alternative to Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just 43 percent of Democrat primary voters want to keep Biden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The polling showed a slight uptick in negative sentiment against the president:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">October: 53 percent prefer an alternative, while 45 want to keep Biden</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March: 52 percent prefer an alternative, while 44 want to keep Biden</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden previously told reporters in December he must run for reelection after prominent Democrats implored him to reconsider a second bid against Trump. &ldquo;Would you be running if Trump wasn&rsquo;t running?&rdquo; a reporter asked Biden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I expect so,&rdquo; Biden replied. &ldquo;But he is running, and &mdash; I just &mdash; I have to run.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s comment came on the same day he told donors he probably would not run if Trump was not running. &ldquo;If Trump wasn&rsquo;t running, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d be running,&rdquo; Biden said, adding that Democrats &ldquo;cannot let him [Trump] win.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National and battleground state polling shows Biden losing to Trump:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning Consult: Trump leads Biden in six of seven crucial swing states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC News: Trump leads Biden by two points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News: Trump trounces Biden by four points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll surveyed 1,0007 registered voters from December 10-13 with a 4.5 point margin of error.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eric Adams admits Biden admin will not help NYC with illegal immigrant crisis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said that Democrats "underestimated" the impact that illegal immigration would have on their cities, and warned New Yorkers to brace for "extremely painful" budget cuts to pay back the debt created by it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with WPIX-TV, Adams said, that a low for the city in 2023 was "150,000 migrants and asylum seekers that put a real bump in the road of our recovery effort in the city."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a meeting with the congressional leaders of the Biden administration earlier this month, Adams said he was not optimistic about getting help from the federal government to deal with the illegal immigrant crisis plaguing New York City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams was forced to cut the budget for the New York City Police Department last month, taking the department below 30,000 personnel.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/aaron-rodgers-likely-cleared-return-ruptured-achilles-next-week-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/sports/aaron-rodgers-likely-cleared-return-ruptured-achilles-next-week-report</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Rodgers likely to be cleared for return from ruptured Achilles next week</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Rodgers' bold prediction is apparently about to play out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four-time MVP ruptured his Achilles Sept. 11 on just his fourth snap as a New York Jet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four days later, he shocked the world when he said, "Give me your doubts,then watch what I do."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Rodgers did not rule out a return this season, saying that "anything is possible." Most doubted, but it may actually become a reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ESPN, the 40-year-old is likely to be medically cleared to return next week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers returned to practice Nov. 29, roughly seven weeks since his injury. It was an unprecedented time frame to practice after such an injury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Rodgers said he underwent "innovative" surgery in his best effort to get back on the field this season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers has said he wanted a return on Christmas Eve. The Jets have until Wednesday to decide whether to activate Rodgers from injured reserve. Otherwise, he would miss the rest of the season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers has wowed just about everyone in the organization with how quickly he has progressed. Earlier this week, he even lined up as a linebacker for the scout team and made a one-handed interception.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, being cleared isn't exactly a guarantee Rodgers would play.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quarterback and the Jets have said the team's playoff chances will play a role in whether he returns. He likely would not return if they are mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, which could happen this weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers recently said there are hardly any risks in taking the field this season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My thing is, what&rsquo;s the worst that can happen?" he told reporters shortly after returning to practice. "Something unfortunate again, and then you just slow the rehab down. I think by my own timetable that if you take the rehab slower and a little more deliberate &mdash; five months, six months max &mdash; is probably the length to get back to 100% if you really take it slow. So, in my opinion, there's not like a downside to coming back and reinjuring it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jets face the Washington Commanders on Christmas Eve.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/fed-interest-rate-decision-december-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/fed-interest-rate-decision-december-2023.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fed holds rates steady, indicates three cuts coming in 2024</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held its key interest rate steady for the third straight time and set the table for multiple cuts to come in 2024 and beyond.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the inflation rate easing and the economy holding in, policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to keep the benchmark overnight borrowing rate in a targeted range between 5.25%-5.5%.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the decision to stay on hold, committee members penciled in at least three rate cuts in 2024, assuming quarter percentage point increments. That&rsquo;s less than market pricing of four, but more aggressive than what officials had previously indicated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets had widely anticipated the decision to stay put, which could end a cycle that has seen 11 hikes, pushing the fed funds rate to its highest level in more than 22 years. There was uncertainty, though, about how ambitious the FOMC might be regarding policy easing. Following the release of the decision, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 400 points, surpassing 37,000 for the first time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee&rsquo;s &ldquo;dot plot&rdquo; of individual members&rsquo; expectations indicates another four cuts in 2025, or a full percentage point. Three more reductions in 2026 would take the fed funds rate down to between 2%-2.25%, close to the long-run outlook, though there was considerable dispersion in the estimates for the final two years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets, though, followed up the meeting and Chair Jerome Powell&rsquo;s press conference by pricing in an even more aggressive rate-cut path, anticipating 1.5 percentage points in reductions next year, double the FOMC&rsquo;s indicated pace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a possible nod that hikes are over, the statement said that the committee would take multiple factors into account for &ldquo;any&rdquo; more policy tightening, a word that had not appeared previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the interest rate hikes, the Fed has been allowing up to $95 billion a month in proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off its balance sheet. That process has continued, and there has been no indication the Fed is willing to curtail that portion of policy tightening.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That echoed new language in the post-meeting statement. The committee added the qualifier that inflation has &ldquo;eased over the past year&rdquo; while maintaining its description of prices as &ldquo;elevated.&rdquo; Fed officials see core inflation falling to 3.2% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024, then to 2.2% in 2025. Finally, it gets back to the 2% target in 2026.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic data released this week showed both consumer and wholesale prices were little changed in November. By some measures, though, the Fed is nearing its 2% inflation target. Bank of America&rsquo;s calculations indicate that the Fed&rsquo;s preferred inflation gauge will be around 3.1% year over year in November, and actually could hit a 2% six-month annualized rate, meeting the central bank&rsquo;s goal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement also noted that the economy &ldquo;has slowed,&rdquo; after saying in November that activity had &ldquo;expanded at a strong pace.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the news conference, Powell said: &ldquo;Recent indicators suggest that growth in economic activity has slowed substantially from the outsized pace seen in the third quarter. Even so, GDP is on track to expand around 2.5% for the year as a whole.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee members upgraded gross domestic product to grow at a 2.6% annualized pace in 2023, a half percentage point increase from the last update in September. Officials see GDP at 1.4% in 2024, roughly unchanged from the previous outlook. Projections for the unemployment rate were largely unchanged, at 3.8% in 2023 and rising to 4.1% in subsequent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials have stressed their willingness to hike rates again if inflation flares up. However, most have said they can be patient now as they watch the impact the previous policy tightening moves are having on the U.S. economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stubbornly high prices have exacted a political toll on President Joe Biden, whose approval rating has suffered in large part because of negative sentiment on how he has handled the economy. There had been some speculation that the Fed could be reluctant to make any dramatic policy actions during a presidential election year, which looms large in 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with real rates, or the difference between the fed funds rate and inflation, running high, the Fed would be more likely to act if the inflation data continues to cooperate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/11/even-leftist-governments-around-the-world-are-moving-to-slash-migration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/11/even-leftist-governments-around-the-world-are-moving-to-slash-migration/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Even Leftist Governments Around the World Are Moving to Slash Migration.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leftist governments in Denmark and Australia are adopting a more hardline stance on immigration than many notionally conservative governments. Australia&rsquo;s governing Labor Party has pledged to cut net immigration in half. Denmark&rsquo;s Social Democrats have pledged zero net immigration, a.k.a. balanced immigration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia, with a population of only around 25 million, suffered net immigration of around 510,000 in the year to June. The government has conceded the system is &ldquo;broken&rdquo; and &ldquo;in tatters&rdquo; &ndash; blaming the previous center-right government. They say they will reduce it to around 250,000 by June 2025.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is growing acknowledgment that an ongoing housing crisis cannot be resolved if mass migration continues at current levels.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denmark, a generous welfare state, is going even further. They aim to balance the number of people entering the country against the number of people leaving, with the government insisting: &ldquo;If you want to be a party of the working class and middle class, you have to ensure that migration has a manageable level.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Democrat lawmaker Rasmus Stoklund explained his party&rsquo;s increasingly anti-immigration stance is the true left-wing position.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The part of society that bears the brunt of unchecked migration is the working-class population that we should be representing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is their children who have to go to schools that experience cultural clashes. It is those people who have to experience the criminality and social problems that follow. The more privileged people in society will only meet migrants if they are the children of diplomats, so for them the issue is not so clear.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denmark is also taking radical action to integrate the existing migration background population. Vollsmose, a notorious suburban &ldquo;no go zone&rdquo;, is being bulldozed, to help integrate its predominantly &ldquo;non-Western&rdquo; residents.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/11/suicide-is-consistently-killing-more-u-s-soldiers-than-anything-else-including-war/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/11/suicide-is-consistently-killing-more-u-s-soldiers-than-anything-else-including-war/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suicide Is Consistently Killing More U.S. Soldiers Than Anything Else, Including War.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suicide accounted for just under 40 percent of United States active military deaths as of December 2022, according to the Defense Casualty Analysis System, which found that U.S. military suicide rates have dramatically increased over the past several decades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the current leading cause of death among servicemen is currently categorized as &ldquo;self-inflicted,&rdquo; with a total of 333 incidents last year. Suicide was recorded as almost ten percent higher in prevalence than accidents, of which there were 265.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, last year represents a slight decrease in the rate of self-inflicted deaths compared to October 2020, in which suicide rates were just under 41 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suicide accounted for roughly ten percent of military deaths when records began in 1980, with that figure remaining mostly stable until the 1990s, in which the rate jumped to 23 percent in 1995. The rate of self-inflicted deaths fell sharply in the mid-2000s, however, much of the decline can be attributed to the increase in &ldquo;hostile action&rdquo; fatalities in 2008.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suicide rates across American society have reached unprecedented levels under the Biden government, with just under 50,000 people killing themselves in 2022. The rate was 14.3 three people per 100,000 &ndash; the highest since 1941.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Donations to Harry and Meghan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Woke&rsquo; Charity Collapse by $11 Million</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&rsquo;s Archewell charitable foundation has reported a massive loss of a $11 million year-on-year collapse in donations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the foundation&rsquo;s website, Harry and Meghan aimed to &ldquo;uplift and unite communities, both local and global, online and offline.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that didn&rsquo;t happen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tax filing disclosed Tuesday, the non-profit organization received just over $2 million in charitable contributions in 2022, compared to $13 million in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some $8.2 million funds remain in the Archewell Foundation accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 28-page report also details the charitable work the foundation has undertaken during 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report stated:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are committed to a simple but profound mission: Show Up, Do Good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But &ldquo;doing good&rdquo; has not come cheap for the woke pair, who recently made the decision only to have two children to help fight climate change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1734930901883129891"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1734930901883129891</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breitbart reported that Archewell&rsquo;s total expenses exceeded its revenue the year before, leaving it down by more than $674,000, according to the public filing. Its revenue in 2021 had exceeded $9 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization&rsquo;s executive director, James Holt, earned a salary of $227,405, including a $20,000 bonus, in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figure represents a 280 percent increase from his salary of less than $60,000 in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also faced more bad news earlier this week after they named Showbusiness&rsquo; biggest losers of 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also faced a belittling on South Park and were dropped from their lucrative $20 million Spotify deal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal couple also faced a roasting in the Hollywood Reporter&rsquo;s &ldquo;brutally honest rundown.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Hibberd contributed the scathing review, noting they were labeled &ldquo;f**king grifters&rdquo; by top executive Bill Simmons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, NBC reported a judge ordered Prince Harry on Monday to pay nearly 50,000 pounds (more than $60,000) in legal fees to the publisher of the Daily Mail tabloid for his failed court challenge in a libel lawsuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Duke of Sussex is suing Associated Newspapers Ltd. over an article that said Harry tried to hide his efforts to retain publicly funded protection in the U.K. after leaving his role as a working member of the royal family.</span></p>]]></description>
