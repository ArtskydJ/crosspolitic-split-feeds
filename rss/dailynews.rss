<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hunter Biden indicted on gun charges in Delaware</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter Biden has been indicted on felony gun charges in the state of Delaware. This after a plea deal fell through earlier this summer that would have let him off the hook for the charges, so long as he met certain conditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden had been accused of lying on an FBI background check form in order to purchase a firearm, one Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver. He said that he was not a drug user when, in fact, he was. This was revealed in his own memoir Beautiful Things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indictment reads that Biden violated Chapter 44, Title 18 of the United States Code by falsely asserting that he was not a drug user on ATF Form 4473. That form required that the buyer must state that he is aware that "making any false oral or written statement... is a crime punishable as a felony under Federal law, and may violate State and /or local law."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden was indicted on three counts. The first is that Biden "knowingly made a false and fictitious written statement, intended and likely to deceive that dealer with respect to a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale of the firearm..."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That count further provides that Biden gave a "written statement on Form 4473 certifying that he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second count states that he made this false statement knowingly "to be kept" in the records of the company from which he made the purchase. The third count is that Biden then possessed the weapon unlawfully.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indictment, delivered by a grand jury, was signed off on by special counsel David Weiss, who is also the US Attorney for the State of Delaware.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden was set to plead guilty to tax charges in June, with the expectation that the gun charge would be dismissed. Weiss, who was prosecuting the case for the state of Delaware and the Department of Justice, was anticipated to make a deal for a diversion agreement for the gun charge. Chris Clark, Biden's attorney, said at the time that "A firearm charge, which will be subject to a pretrial diversion agreement and will not be the subject of the plea agreement, will also be filed by the Government."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That deal fell apart in July after US District Judge Maryellen Noreika recognized that in the diversion agreement, it appeared that both defense and prosecution had agreed that Biden would also gain immunity for any charges stemming from not having filed as a foreign agent when conducting business deals overseas. The prosecutors explained that this was not their understanding, at which point the defense also did not go along with the plea deal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maximum prison term for lying on the ATF form is 10 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter's father, President Joe Biden, is a staunch proponent of gun control legislation. He routinely touts the importance of universal background checks, claiming that this way people who should not have guns will get guns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After mass shooting events during his presidency he has stressed the need for background checks before firearms purchases are permitted to be made. He has also pressed for a "major crackdown" on gun dealers, the very kinds of gun dealers to whom his son submitted falsified records.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has also demanded that more states enact "red flag" laws, which allow family members to have law enforcement take a gun from a gun owner in the event that a family member or concerned person claims that gun owner is not stable enough to own a gun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden further said that the right to bear arms, as secured by the Bill of Rights under the Second Amendment, is "not absolute," and that no right "is absolute."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden said that "the Second Amendment, like all other rights, is not absolute."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/09/13/eu-parliament-legislates-for-the-sale-of-human-embryos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/09/13/eu-parliament-legislates-for-the-sale-of-human-embryos/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EU Parliament Legislates for The Sale of Human Embryos.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the European Parliament have voted overwhelmingly in favor of a new &ldquo;Substances of Human Origin&rdquo; (SoHO) framework, which permits the sale of human embryos and degrades human life to be the equivalent of any other cells or tissue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The measures are set to regulate the supply and donations of so-called &ldquo;substances,&rdquo; such as blood, cells, and tissue, used for medically assisted reproduction as well as other procedures, including transfusions and transplants. They also allow people to receive &ldquo;compensation or reimbursement for losses or expenses incurred&rdquo; when making a donation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures passed in the parliament by 483 votes to 52 on Tuesday, despite amendments proposed by conservatives to prevent the use of fetuses for financial gain being voted down. Those who voted in favor also ignored the appeals made by the Commission of Bishops&rsquo; Conferences of the European Union, which argued: &ldquo;Human life is not just a &lsquo;substance of human origin&rsquo;&hellip;human life from the beginning, including unborn life &lsquo;possesses its own dignity, right, and independent right of protection.'&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of the NBIC Ethics think tank, Laetitia Pouliquen, also warned after the vote passed that it would create a &ldquo;highest-bidder body and fertility market&rdquo; across the continent. The new framework will be sent to the European Council, with further discussions to start at the beginning of the next year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/13/hurricane-lee-margot-new-england-atlantic-develop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/13/hurricane-lee-margot-new-england-atlantic-develop/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hurricane Lee Grows So Terrifyingly Huge, It Doesn&rsquo;t Matter If It Makes Landfall. We&rsquo;re In Trouble.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Lee increased to an absolutely enormous storm overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, and is currently estimated to be roughly 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) across.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Hurricane Lee doesn&rsquo;t make landfall, its current trajectory is going to cause coastal flooding and extremely strong winds off the shores of the Northeast and into Atlantic Canada throughout the week, multiple forecasters said Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. While AccuWeather hopes Lee will be downgraded to a Cat. 2 storm by Friday, down to a Cat. 1 or Tropical Storm by Saturday and Sunday, there are multiple landfall scenarios being monitored at this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England is already suffering from extensive flooding, which left vehicles stranded and homes damaged, as seen in footage shared online. Things would probably only get worse should Lee&rsquo;s trajectory shift and sit over the region.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Hurricane Margot is heading in almost the exact same direction as Lee, but coming at the Northeast and Atlantic Canada from the middle of the Atlantic Ocean at the time of writing. But regardless of where Lee lands, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said there &ldquo;will be little to no significance on exactly where the center reaches the coast.&rdquo; The entire area is under threat of hazards, according to the agency, and all those living within it should prepare immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two additional areas of disorganized storms are currently brewing between North Africa and northern South America, in a similar region to where Lee and Margot first formed. The NHC estimates a 50% chance these areas turn into a single cyclone in the 48 hours from the time of writing. As late summer weather continues to plague the U.S., we are almost certainly on track for a fall defined by hurricanes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/09/13/homicides-up-29-in-bowsers-d-c/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/09/13/homicides-up-29-in-bowsers-d-c/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homicides Up 29% in Bowser&rsquo;s D.C.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homicides in Democrat-dominated Washington D.C. are up by 29 percent compared to this time last year, with annual murders on course to hit their highest total in 20 years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been an even sharper 67 percent rise in robberies, and minors are increasingly entangled in the crime wave as both perpetrators and victims. Forty-one youths aged 12 to 15 had been arrested for carjackings and 81 under-18s had been shot as of the end of August &ndash; up from 61 over the same time frame in 2022 and 37 in 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Party dominates D.C. politics, with Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. Council all being Democrats or &ldquo;Independents&rdquo; whose previous affiliation was Democrat.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Bowser has claimed she wants to &ldquo;throw every resource at reducing crime&rdquo; and she has increased the latest public safety budget &ndash; but during the &lsquo;Defund the Police&rsquo; mania following the death of George Floyd in 2020 the Counil trimmed $32 million from police funding, as $4.8 million was splurged on the creation of Black Lives Matter Plaza.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowser&rsquo;s apologists sometimes complain that the federal government is in charge of prosecutors and some other criminal justice functionaries in D.C., although the federal government is also under Democrat control at present.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>US judge freezes New Mexico governor's gun ban</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge in New Mexico on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order against the state governor's ban on carrying guns in Albuquerque and its surrounding county, a move which threw the state into the center of the U.S. gun-rights debate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Court Judge David Urias said Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham's 30-day suspension of concealed and open firearm carry rights went against a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that people had a right to carry a gun outside their homes for self defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;They just want the right to carry their guns,&rdquo; Urias said of the several plaintiffs who requested restraining orders against Lujan Grisham's Sept. 8 emergency public health order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic governor issued the suspension on firearm carry laws to offer a "cooling-off period" in which authorities could address solutions to the state's high rates of gun crime after several children were fatally shot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lujan Grisham's order outraged gun-rights advocates and drew backlash from fellow Democrats and law enforcement officials, also Democrats, who called it unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun control campaigners called the move "courageous" and the Catholic Archbishop of Santa Fe feared more value was being given to gun rights than the life of an 11-year-old boy shot dead last week in an apparent Albuquerque road rage incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albuquerque's mayor and Bernalillo County's sheriff, both Democrats, have urged Lujan Grisham to call a special state legislative session on gun crime after the gun ban.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Tim Keller said that, in order to fight gun crime, he needed legislation to fix a broken criminal justice system, regulate assault weapons and provide addiction and mental health services, among other measures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Albuquerque families can't afford political debates that distract us from fighting violent crime," Keller wrote in a letter to the governor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun violence kills around 500 people a year in New Mexico, which ranks sixth among U.S. states for gun deaths per capita, according to gun violence prevention group Everytown for Gun Safety. Albuquerque is among the 10 most dangerous U.S. cities, based on FBI violent crime data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lujan Grisham favors a ban on so-called semi-automatic assault weapons, among other gun control measures, and her office on Wednesday welcomed Keller's call for a special legislative session.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Police called after Biden's energy secretary uses nonelectric car to reserve EV charger</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Georgia family called the police on Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm after an electric vehicle charging station was blocked by a gas-powered car, which had been parked by a staff member of the Department of Energy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event occurred during a four-day road trip that Granholm was taking to demonstrate the effectiveness of electric vehicles. During the trip, the group's caravan was going to charge up at a suburb of Augusta, Georgia, but due to a lack of charging stations needed for all of their vehicles, a staff member with the group parked a nonelectric vehicle by one of the chargers to reserve a spot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after, a family with a baby was planning to charge their vehicle but could not due to the nonelectric vehicle blocking the charger, leading to them calling the police. However, it is not illegal for nonelectric vehicles to park at EV charging stations in Georgia, meaning the police could not do anything about the situation. The Energy Department staff were eventually able to work things out after they sent other vehicles to slower chargers to allow the family to charge their vehicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's just par for the course," said John Ryan, a driver of an electric BMW who was also waiting to charge his vehicle. "They'll get it together at some point."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granholm's road trip comes as the Biden administration pushes for electric vehicles in the auto industry, with the Energy Department announcing last month that it would be allocating $2 billion in grants and $10 billion in loans to support automakers and part suppliers. This allocation would be for automakers to retrofit their existing facilities and expand the production of electric vehicles and their components.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Ford CEO Jim Farley said he received a "reality check" when he tried to charge his electric vehicle during a road trip he took himself. When charging his vehicle, he said his car was only charged to 40% during the 40 minutes he charged it, according to a video he posted to X, formerly known as Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1690858328606355456"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1690858328606355456</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump, who is running for president again in 2024, has criticized the Biden administration's stance against gas-powered cars and appliances, saying voters want to have a "choice for buying cars and washing machines." He has encouraged auto industry workers to ask their leaders to vote for him in the next presidential election, stating he will "immediately" end the electric vehicle "madness."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/nation/economy/income-dropped-poverty-soared-under-biden-census-bureau"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/nation/economy/income-dropped-poverty-soared-under-biden-census-bureau</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Income dropped, poverty soared under Biden: Census Bureau</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the Biden administration's efforts to tout the alleged successes of "Bidenomics," a report from the United States Census Bureau has revealed that many Americans saw their economic situation deteriorate dramatically in the first half of Biden's term.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the official poverty rate hovered around 11.5% in both 2021 and 2022, according to the report, the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) increased 4.6% in 2022 to reach 12.4%, marking the first overall increase in that metric since 2010. In total, 37.9 million Americans lived in poverty in 2022. The report partially attributed the increase to the expiration of tax credits and pandemic stimulus payments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income, meanwhile, dropped across an array of metrics. Real median household income declined by 2.3% from $76,330 to $74,580, while real median earnings of all workers dropped 2.2%. The drop was less severe among full-time, year-round workers, who saw a 1.3% decline. Inflation soared 7.8% from 2021 to 2022, marking the largest single-year increase in cost of living since 1981.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Census Bureau statement follows some other bad economic news for the president. The unemployment rate in August rose from 3.5% to 3.8% while inflation ticked up to 3.2%, marking the first increase after a consistent, year-long decline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden has repeatedly insisted that economic conditions are improving in the United States and has consistently attributed the nominal upswing to his policies. Americans, however, appear skeptical of that assertion, with 37.8% approving of his handling of the economy in the RealClearPolitics polling average, compared to 58.9% who disapprove.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/chicago-mayor-faces-pushback-local-leaders-plan-house-migrants-tents-help-your-people-first"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/chicago-mayor-faces-pushback-local-leaders-plan-house-migrants-tents-help-your-people-first</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chicago mayor faces pushback from local leaders for plan to house migrants in tents: &lsquo;Help your people first'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is facing opposition from local leaders after he asked that "all 50 city council members" find space in their wards to help house "more than 200 migrants" in tents, according to a new report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some aldermen are pushing back on Johnson&rsquo;s plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I've looked in my ward. I just don't have any available space. I have one of the most dense wards in the city," Alderman Brian Hopkins said, according to ABC7 Chicago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alderman David Moore of the 17th Ward called on Chicago to help its own community first.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm a believer in help your people first, help yourselves first, help your community first. Then reach out and help others," Moore said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some aldermen have also voiced support for Johnson&rsquo;s plan to house migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson has announced that he wants to relocate the city&rsquo;s nearly 1,600 asylum-seeking migrants, currently living in police stations, to winterized camps with big tents before cold weather hits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the massive tents will be able to hold up to 1,000 migrants, the mayor said, and under his plan the camps will provide meals as well as recreational and educational programming. Currently, 16 shelters in the city house 13,500 migrants, and more arrive every day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chicago Sun-Times reported the cost to shelter the 13,500 migrants costs the city about $30 million per month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson and his administration are working with the state of Illinois and Cook County to establish more shelters to take some of the pressure off Chicago, the mayor said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"These families are coming to the city of Chicago," Johnson said. "If we do not create an infrastructure where we&rsquo;re able to support and, quite frankly, contain these individuals who have experienced a great deal of harm, individuals who are desperate &hellip; that type of desperation will lead to chaos."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dehumanizing! MSNBC's Jen Psaki Compares Unborn Babies to Broccoli, Lumps of Coal</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday&rsquo;s edition of Inside with Jen Psaki, the former Biden press secretary mocked a Republican strategy session where pollsters suggested the term &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t helping the GOP, so they suggested the term &ldquo;pro-baby&rdquo; instead. This spurred Psaki to compare babies to....broccoli and a lump of coal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to think it&rsquo;s terribly dehumanizing to call a biological male &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;his.&rdquo; Apparently, comparing a baby to broccoli and lumps of coal is good, swaggering comedy. Democrats have suggested abortion is about a "choice," not a child. The act of abortion is far more dehumanizing than language.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1700914367326269442"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1700914367326269442</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The branding isn&rsquo;t the problem here! The policy is the problem, it is hard to roll out an effective rebrand for a product that customers hate.&rdquo; &hellip; you heard that right.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The "product" is saving babies from the Planned Parenthood slaughterhouse. Democrats get piles of money and logistical support from the slaughterhouse operators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psaki was touting an NBCNews.com story which underlined Psaki was doing the usual DNC messaging. The headline was "Democrats say Republican effort to rebrand 'pro-life' won't persuade voters." This story, based on anonymous Senate Republicans, contained all the Democrat arguments that Psaki made in this segment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-confirms-more-than-100b-in-taxpayer-resources-spent-on-ukraine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-confirms-more-than-100b-in-taxpayer-resources-spent-on-ukraine</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>White House confirms more than $100B spent on Ukraine war</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House confirmed the Biden administration has spent more than $100 billion on the war in Ukraine, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information came as a response from the White House&rsquo;s Office of Management and Budget to Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio and more than 30 Senate Republicans who demanded in January a "full crosscutting" report on security assistance provided to Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Digital obtained the OMB letter and spreadsheet responding to Vance more than 7 months later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMB Director Shalanda Young penned a letter to Vance explaining the security assistance the United States has provided to Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"With bipartisan Congressional support, the United States has provided security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as it continues to fight to defend its sovereignty following Russia&rsquo;s brutal invasion," Young wrote. "This support has been critical to Ukraine&rsquo;s success on the battlefield, as well as the ability of its people to endure under harsh conditions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young stressed that President Biden "has made clear" that the United States "will not waver in our commitment to the Ukrainian people as they fight for their freedom and independence."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young told Vance that Biden administration officials "agree that transparency and accountability are paramount to ensuring American taxpayers can be confident in their assistance in helping the Ukrainians fight for their country against Russia&rsquo;s aggression."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young provided Vance a "table that details supplemental funding provided in support of Ukraine in addition to current obligation levels, which OMB shared with Congress" in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table shows that a total of $101,198,000,000 has been obligated/executed by the Office of Management and Budget.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the $101.2 billion already spent, the spreadsheet appears to outline plans to spend an additional $9.8 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table breaks down the spending from the Department of Defense; Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative; State Department; and other federal agencies providing aid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the Pentagon requested an additional $6 billion due to an accounting error at the Department of Defense. Vance and Sen. Josh Hawley introduced legislation soon after to prevent such mistakes from being repeated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the more than $100 billion already spent in Ukraine, the White House last month asked Congress to authorize an additional $24 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's request comprises $13 billion for defense and $11 billion for economic and humanitarian aid in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Whistleblower says CIA officials were paid to change view that COVID originated in Wuhan lab</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most officers on the CIA's COVID Discovery Team concluded that the coronavirus originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, but they changed their positions after receiving a monetary incentive, a senior-level CIA agent told Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whistleblower informed Coronavirus Pandemic Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Brad Wenstrup and Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Turner that at the end of the CIA's COVID review, "six of the seven members of the Team believed the intelligence and science were sufficient to make a low confidence assessment that COVID-19 originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China," the Ohio Republicans wrote in a letter Tuesday to CIA Director William Burns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team's seventh member, who was the most senior person, was the only person to believe that the virus originated from an animal, the lawmakers also said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The whistleblower further contends that to come to the eventual public determination of uncertainty, the other six members were given a significant monetary incentive to change their position," the chairmen wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegations, which stemmed from a "seemingly credible source" require Congress to investigate how the CIA handled its investigation of COVID's origins, according to the lawmakers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republicans are demanding the CIA hand over information to their committees as part of their probe, and they threatened to use "additional tools and authorities to satisfy our legislative and oversight requirements" if the agency does not comply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.usni.org/2023/09/09/u-s-canadian-warships-transit-taiwan-strait-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://news.usni.org/2023/09/09/u-s-canadian-warships-transit-taiwan-strait-2</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>U.S., Canadian Warships Transit Taiwan Strait</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An American guided-missile destroyer and a Royal Canadian Navy frigate sailed through the Taiwan Strait in a tandem Saturday transit, U.S. 7th Fleet announced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japan-based USS Ralph Johnson and HMCS Ottawa passed through the strait after drilling with Japanese ships in the East China Sea, near Okinawa, USNI News reported on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The ships transited through a corridor in the strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state,&rdquo; reads the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ralph Johnson and Ottawa&rsquo;s bilateral transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the commitment of the United States and our allies and partners to a free and open Indo-Pacific.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an exercise earlier this week, Ralph Johnson and Ottawa sailed with big deck helicopter carrier JS Izumo and destroyer JS Samidare as part of the trilateral exercise Noble Stingray that included anti-submarine warfare drills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation crew aboard Ottawa took footage of a People&rsquo;s Liberation Army Navy guided-missile destroyer shadowing the formation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The heavily armed Chinese destroyer, the Luyang, closely followed the convoy of ships in the East China Sea, calling out repeatedly to the Canadians on maritime radio, and coming within just over a kilometer of the allied ships,&rdquo; reads the CBC report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unclear if Hohhot followed Ralph Johnson and Ottawa during their transit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last reported U.S. surface ship transit was by U.S. Coast Guard cutter Stratton in June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And lastly a little plug for myself! I&rsquo;ve launched a podcast about my favorite topic, sports! It&rsquo;s called Game Time with Garrison &amp; Garrett&hellip; you can find us on Apple Podcasts, Itunes, Spotify, and Google podcasts! If you&rsquo;d give it a listen, I&rsquo;d greatly appreciate you.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, September 12th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/09/10/estimated-300000-impacted-by-earthquake-in-morocco-with-at-least-2000-dead/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/09/10/estimated-300000-impacted-by-earthquake-in-morocco-with-at-least-2000-dead/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Estimated 300,000 Impacted by Earthquake in Morocco, with at Least 2,000 Dead</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A magnitude 3.9 aftershock rattled Moroccans on Sunday as they prayed for victims of the nation&rsquo;s strongest earthquake in more than a century and worked to rescue survivors while soldiers and workers brought water and supplies to mountain villages in ruins. More than 2,000 people are dead &ndash; a number that is expected to rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The United Nations estimated that 300,000 people were affected by Friday night&rsquo;s magnitude 6.8 quake and some Moroccans complained on social networks that the government wasn&rsquo;t allowing more help from outside. International aid crews were prepared to deploy, but remained in limbo waiting for the Morocco government to request their assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We know there is a great urgency to save people and dig under the remains of buildings,&rdquo; said the, founder of Rescuers Without Borders, who had a team stuck in Paris waiting for the green light. &ldquo;There are people dying under the rubble, and we cannot do anything to save them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Those left homeless &ndash; or fearing more aftershocks &ndash; from Friday night&rsquo;s earthquake slept outside Saturday, in the streets of the ancient city of Marrakech or under makeshift canopies in Atlas Mountain towns like Moulay Brahim, which were among the hardest-hit. The worst destruction was in small, rural communities that are hard for rescuers to reach because of the mountainous terrain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Those same areas were shaken anew Sunday by a magnitude 3.9 quake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear if the temblor caused more damage or casualties, but it was likely strong enough to rattle nerves in areas where damage has left buildings unstable and people have spoken of their fears of aftershocks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The earthquake on Friday toppled buildings not built to withstand such a mighty quake, trapping people in the rubble and sending others fleeing in terror. A total of 2,012 people were confirmed dead and at least 2,059 more people were injured &ndash; 1,404 of them critically &ndash; Morocco&rsquo;s Interior Ministry reported Saturday night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Flags were lowered across Morocco, as King Mohammed VI ordered three days of national mourning starting Sunday. The army mobilized specialized search and rescue teams, and the king ordered water, food rations and shelter to be provided to those who lost their homes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Aid offers have poured in from around the world and the U.N. said it had a team in Morocco coordinating with authorities about how international partners can provide support. About 100 teams made up of a total of 3,500 rescuers from around the world are registered with a U.N. platform and ready to deploy in Morocco when asked, Rescuers Without Borders said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a sign that Morocco may be prepared to accept more help from outside, the Spanish military said it had sent an air force plane carrying an urban search and rescue team of 56 soldiers and four dogs to Marrakech to help. Foreign Minister Jos&eacute; Manuel Albares said in a radio interview that the deployment was in response to a bilateral request for help from Moroccan authorities. Another rescue team from Nice, France, also was on its way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In France, home to many people with links to Morocco, towns and cities have offered more than 2 million euros ($2.1 million) in aid, and popular performers are rallying to collect donations. The Moroccan king ordered the opening of special bank accounts to allow donations to help those in need.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66771568"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66771568</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Kim Jong Un: North Korea leader's armoured train reportedly heading to meet Putin</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The armoured train that Mr Kim uses for foreign visits appears to have departed Pyongyang, South Korean media reported citing a government official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The meeting between the two leaders is expected to take place as early as Tuesday local time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Kremlin has confirmed that Mr Kim will visit Russia "in the coming days".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Pentagon said it believes Mr Kim is travelling to Russia and it expects "some type of meeting", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">If the summit with Mr Putin goes ahead, it will be the North Korean leader's first international trip in more than four years, and the first since the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The two leaders will likely discuss the possibility of North Korea providing Moscow with weapons to support its war in Ukraine, a US official earlier told CBS, the BBC's US partner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr Kim's last trip abroad was also to Vladivostok in 2019 for his first summit with Mr Putin after the collapse of North Korea's nuclear disarmament talks with then US President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It is rumoured to include at least 20 bulletproof cars, making it heavier than average trains and unable to go beyond 59 km/h (37mph). His journey to Vladivostok is expected to take an entire day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The possible meeting comes after the White House said it had new information that arms negotiations between the two countries were "actively advancing".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">National Security Council spokesman John Kirby earlier said Russia's Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, had tried to "convince Pyongyang to sell artillery ammunition" to Russia during a recent visit to North Korea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The summit comes at a time when both Russia and North Korea have things that the other country wants, according to Ankit Panda from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"What'll matter now is if both sides can find suitable prices they're willing to pay for the other's assistance," he told the BBC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russia will likely ask North Korea for conventional arms, including artillery shells and rocket artillery munitions in exchange for food and raw materials, and continuing support at international forums like the United Nations, he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"This could open up the possibility of North Korea transferring more sophisticated weaponry to Russia to allow Moscow to maintain and backfill its own stocks of conventional weapons," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It is thought that Russia might need 122mm and 152mm shells because its stocks are running low, but it is not easy to determine North Korea's full artillery inventory, given its secretive nature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Weapons on display at the meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Shoigu in July included the Hwasong intercontinental ballistic missile, believed to be the country's first ICBM to use solid propellants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It was the first time Mr Kim had opened the country's doors to foreign guests since the Covid pandemic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Police budget cut in NYC as illegal immigrant crisis forces women, children to sleep in tents</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Saturday, city officials announced that the New York Police Department's budget would be cut, with that money re-allocated to solving the migrant crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The move comes as New York City continues to deal with rampant crime and an unprecedented influx of illegal immigrants, many of whom, including women and children, may soon be forced out of shelters and into tents on the street.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Budget Director Jacques Jiha revealed in a memo over the weekend explaining that Mayor Eric Adams, who recently said the migrant crisis could "destroy" the city, will soon "issue a directive to implement an overtime reduction initiative for our city's four uniformed agencies."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">These include the NYPD, the fire department, the corrections department, and the department of sanitation, all of whom provide vital services to the city and its residents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Jiha also asked the agencies to "track overtime spending and their progress in meeting the reduction target," and submit monthly reports to the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The head of the Police Benevolent Association, Patrick Hendry, slammed the move as out of touch with reality.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"It is going to be impossible for the NYPD to significantly reduce overtime unless it fixes its staffing crisis," he said. "We are still thousands of cops short, and we're struggling to drive crime back to pre-2020 levels without adequate personnel."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As the Daily Mail reports, New York City is currently spending close to $10 million per day dealing with the surge of migrants, with no end to the crisis in sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The massive cuts to the budgets of essential city services will only cover two-thirds of the projected costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As more migrants arrive, shelters and other facilities have reached their breaking point. During an interview with PIX11 on Sunday, Adams said that those who had been given priority for indoor sleeping areas could lose that privilege.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fauci-federal-recommendations-possible-not-mandates-uptick-covid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fauci-federal-recommendations-possible-not-mandates-uptick-covid</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fauci says federal mask 'recommendations' are possible amid uptick in COVID</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci predicted Sunday that federal recommendations for masking may be given as COVID-19 cases continue to rise, but not federal mandates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In an appearance on ABC's This Week, Fauci told Jon Karl he would be "extremely surprised" if a federal mask mandate were put in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I can see that if we get a significant uptick in cases that you may see the recommendation that masks be used under certain circumstances and indoor crowded settings, but I don't see there'd be certainly not federal mandates," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"There may be local organizations that may require masks, but I think what we're gonna see mostly are, if the cases go up that there might be recommendations, not mandates. There's a big difference there," Fauci continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Karl also pressed the former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director at the National Institutes of Health on the efficacy of masking in retrospect. Asked about new studies indicating that the practice of masking may not have been effective in containing the COVID-19 virus, Fauci claimed some studies are being misconstrued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/michigan-state-suspends-mel-tucker-without-pay-sexual-harassment-allegations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/sports/michigan-state-suspends-mel-tucker-without-pay-sexual-harassment-allegations</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Michigan State suspends Mel Tucker without pay amid sexual harassment allegations</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michigan State suspended football coach Mel Tucker Sunday amid an investigation after he was accused of sexually harassing a rape survivor last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michigan State athletic director Alan Haller made the announcement following conflicting reports Tucker was going to be fired and/or suspended. He added that Tucker was suspended without pay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tucker has been the head coach of the Spartans since 2020 and signed a 10-year, $95 million contract extension in November 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The allegations against Tucker surfaced earlier in the day in a USA Today report. According to ESPN, he was under investigation over the allegations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michigan State secondary coach Harlon Barnett will serve as the interim head coach. Former coach Mark Dantonio is returning as an associate head coach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Brenda Tracy, a sexual assault prevention advocate who was gang raped by four college football players in 1998, filed the complaint against Tucker and alleged the coach had asked whether she would date him if he weren&rsquo;t already married and gratified himself without her consent during a phone call, according to USA Today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tucker claims all of this was consensual - stating: "Ms. Tracy&rsquo;s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me," Tucker wrote to the Title IX investigator in March, according to USA Today. "I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition."</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Health Insurance Costs Projected To Have Highest Increase In Over a Decade</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employer health insurance costs are expected to increase significantly in 2024, affecting both workers and businesses as hospital operating costs rise, according to data reported by The Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, the costs for health insurance coverage from employers are expected to increase by around 6.5%, which could be the biggest increase in more than a decade, according to survey data acquired by the WSJ. Driving the increase in health insurance costs are inflated labor costs for hospitals and a large demand for expensive new diabetes and obesity drugs, which are being passed down to insurance companies in new contracts with the hospitals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals who do not receive insurance from their employer but rather through the Affordable Care Act will see their premium costs rise by about 6% next year, which is comparable to the increase this year, according to the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1696593061545906458"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1696593061545906458</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well at least Joe Biden feels your pain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers are likely to pay more out of pocket as employers shift some of the cost of inflation down to employees, according to the WSJ. Despite the shift, a tight labor market may push employers to shoulder a bigger share as hiring and retaining workers remain competitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unemployment ticked up in August but remained relatively low at 3.8%, up from 3.5% in July. The U.S. added 187,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in a sign of a slowing job market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, the Biden administration released a list of ten drugs that Medicare will negotiate prices with drug manufacturers over in an effort to reduce costs. The negotiations are set to begin later in 2023 but will not go into effect until 2026, with companies being threatened with up to a 95% tax if they do not cooperate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/david-strom/2023/09/06/uk-you-may-soon-go-to-jail-if-you-dont-upgrade-your-energy-efficiency-n576157#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/david-strom/2023/09/06/uk-you-may-soon-go-to-jail-if-you-dont-upgrade-your-energy-efficiency-n576157#google_vignette</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UK: you may soon go to jail if you don't upgrade your energy efficiency</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the Industrial Revolution began in the UK.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the mastery of energy&ndash;replacing muscle power with fossil fuels that fundamentally transformed everything. We still describe an engine&rsquo;s output as &ldquo;horsepower&rdquo; for a reason: for most of human history the fastest anything could travel was the speed of a horse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless, of course, you were falling off a cliff. Then you could go faster, but the ride was short.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK&ndash;which is still led by the Tories only because Labour is even worse&ndash;is looking to undo the Industrial Revolution. In a ridiculous bid to save Gaia from an imagined threat, the government is proposing to create new criminal laws that would imprison and fine people for not complying with new energy efficiency standards. Soon they will make excessive energy use&ndash;and that will be energy use that rises above &ldquo;Net Zero&rdquo;&ndash;could be a criminal offense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I am not kidding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property owners who fail to comply with new energy efficiency rules could face prison under government plans that have sparked a backlash from Tory MPs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ministers want to grant themselves powers to create new criminal offences and increase civil penalties as part of efforts to hit net zero targets. Under the proposals, people who fall foul of regulations to reduce their energy consumption could face up to a year in prison and fines of up to &pound;15,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tory backbenchers are set to rebel against the plans, which they fear would lead to the criminalisation of homeowners, landlords and businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals are contained in the Government&rsquo;s controversial Energy Bill, which is set to come before the Commons for the first time when MPs return from their summer break on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides for &ldquo;the creation of criminal offences&rdquo; where there is &ldquo;non-compliance with a requirement imposed by or under energy performance regulations&rdquo;. People could also be prosecuted for &ldquo;provision of false information&rdquo; about energy efficiency or the &ldquo;obstruction of&hellip; an enforcement authority&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking in on the Hollywood Strike&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/09/06/report-striking-hollywood-workers-facing-evictions-some-living-in-their-cars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/09/06/report-striking-hollywood-workers-facing-evictions-some-living-in-their-cars/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Striking Hollywood Workers Facing Evictions, Some Living in Their Cars</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the dual Hollywood strikes drag on with no end in sight, writers and actors are increasingly finding themselves in dire financial straits, with a growing number of striking workers reportedly facing evictions as they can no longer afford to pay rent. In certain cases, some have resorted to living in their cars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several charitable organizations that have been supporting striking Hollywood workers with grants said they are seeing housing difficulties impact actors and writers as well as blue-collar crew members, according to an account from The Hollywood Reporter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of crew members ranging from lighting personnel to makeup artists have been forced into long-term unemployment due to the strikes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many non-celebrity actors, the strikes have been financially ruinous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The strike has had a massive impact on my housing situation. I worked one day in May, and since then all the work has stopped,&rdquo; actor David Baach told The Hollywood Reporter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve almost depleted my entire savings, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to pay my rent the last few months. My building manager and property owners extended me a grace period due to the good social credit I had built up by doing some gardening and landscaping in our building&rsquo;s common area. However, in early August, I received an eviction notice from the building&rsquo;s management company taped to my front door.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders of two Hollywood charities &mdash; the Entertainment Community Fund and the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund&nbsp; &mdash; told the magazine that people are losing their homes due to the strikes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;People are becoming unhoused, they&rsquo;re being evicted from their apartments and they&rsquo;re not paying their mortgages so eventually they will lose their homes as well. We&rsquo;re talking to people who are living in their cars, in some cases with their families,&rdquo; MPTF president and CEO Bob Beitcher reportedly said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MPTF is giving away $1,500 grants to striking workers but the amount doesn&rsquo;t come close to covering monthly rent in a city as expensive as Los Angeles and its surroundings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actors&rsquo; and writers&rsquo; strikes against Hollywood studios show no signs of ending as the warring sides continue to dig in their heels on key negotiating points regarding streaming compensation and A.I.&nbsp; has brought TV and movie production to a virtual halt around the country, putting thousands of people out of work and damaging local economies coast to coast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/sound-of-freedom-number-1-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/sound-of-freedom-number-1-latin-america/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Sound of Freedom&rsquo; Nabs No. 1 Slot in 18 Latin American Countries</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sound of Freedom&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t done quite yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The summer&rsquo;s indie sensation finally fell out of the top 10 box office results after earning north of $180 million at the U.S. box office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those numbers are staggering and would be the summer&rsquo;s biggest story if not for a certain one-two punch dubbed &ldquo;Barbenheimer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Freedom,&rdquo; which follows a Homeland Security agent (Jim Caviezel) tracking down a little girl abducted by sex traffickers, is now a global sensation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film scored 18 number-one slots across Latin America over the weekend, according to Angel Studios.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexico</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guatemala</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honduras</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Salvador</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicaragua</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costa Rica</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panama</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colombia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venezuela</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecuador</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peru</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolivia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belize</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paraguay</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chile</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uruguay</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argentina</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominican Republic</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film also performed respectively in other nations during its opening weekend:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1 in New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 in Australia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 in South Africa</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4 in the United Kingdom</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney infamously acquired the film during its 2019 takeover of 20th Century Fox but didn&rsquo;t know what to do with the property. So the Mouse House shelved it for five years before Angel Studios bought the rights to the film and released it independently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mainstream media savaged the film in cruel and unprofessional ways. Reporters attacked Caviezel for his political views and suggested the film addressed an issue that&rsquo;s based on conspiracy theory more than fact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most absurd line of attack?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some outlets used one of the 6,000+ people who crowdfunded the movie&rsquo;s marketing efforts against the project. The person in question is tied up in a child custody dispute framed as &ldquo;child abduction.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film&rsquo;s global revenue is still dramatically lower than its domestic haul. So far, &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo; has earned more than $2 million outside the U.S.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. federal deficit is projected to nearly double this year as a result of higher interest rates and lower tax revenue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gap between what the government spends and what it collects is expected to grow from about $1 trillion last year to $2 trillion for the 2023 fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, according to the latest projections from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonpartisan group that advocates for reducing the federal deficit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This would be the highest deficit we&rsquo;ve ever had outside of a recession or national emergency," Marc Goldwein, a senior policy director at CRFB, told FOX Business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sizable increase stems from a number of factors, including high inflation, more expensive interest payments and a drop in tax receipts. It comes on the heels of a record drop in the budget shortfall last year, as the deficit dropped from close to $3 trillion to roughly $1 trillion after the government's record spending during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the government enjoyed a surge in capital gains revenue after Americans capitalized on the booming market the previous year, sold more stock and recorded large gains. The market has not fared as well since then, leading to a sharp drop in capital gains tax revenue compared with last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treasury Department likewise benefited from a spike in general tax collection, because surging inflation essentially pushed up nominal income for millions of households. Although the IRS indexes the tax code to inflation, it does so on a lag. Higher federal income tax brackets and standard deductions took effect at the beginning of 2023, essentially allowing more Americans to shield their income from the IRS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security and Medicare are also indexed to inflation, meaning the government is spending more money on those programs than it did in fiscal year 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"But mostly what&rsquo;s happening is it&rsquo;s coming to the new normal, from an unusually low 2022 deficit," Goldwein said. "That&rsquo;s pretty scary, because normal before the pandemic was $1 trillion. And in 2015, it was $500 billion. So we went from $500 billion is the normal, to $1 trillion is the normal, to $2 trillion is the normal in less than a decade."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figures exclude President Biden's $400 billion student loan cancellation plan, which was counted in the official 2022 deficit numbers but never implemented because the Supreme Court struck the policy down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such massive spending imbalances highlight the toll that high and rising debt can take on everyday Americans. High deficits can fuel inflation, and high debt can push up interest rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mortgage rates are as high as they&rsquo;ve been since well before the financial crisis," Goldwein said. "Car loan rates, student loan rates, credit card rates, they&rsquo;re all really high."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deficit surge comes as lawmakers rush to avert a government shutdown. The White House has urged Congress to pass a short-term funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, in order to keep the government solvent while lawmakers continue negotiations over longer-term funding bills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., have both said they want to pass a short-term deal to keep the government running.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a group of House Republicans &mdash; the House Freedom Caucus &mdash; is demanding a number of concessions as part of the continuing resolution, raising the risk of more down-to-the-wire drama on Capitol Hill.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden to wear mask indoors after COVID-19 exposure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden will don a mask indoors after he was exposed to COVID-19 through his wife, first lady Jill Biden, according to the White House.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1699269260260823345"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1699269260260823345</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Studies have repeatedly shown masks don't prevent Covid transmission and might even have health consequences to wearers. - But I digress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, who awarded the Medal of Honor to Army Capt. Larry Taylor for conspicuous gallantry on Tuesday, is expected to depart Thursday for India and the Group of 20 leaders summit. During the Medal of Honor ceremony, Biden took off his mask for his remarks and did not put it back on to hang the trinket around Taylor's neck or to leave the East Room.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National security adviser Jake Sullivan downplayed the prospect that a presidential COVID-19 diagnosis would disrupt his foreign trip based on leaders' past experience social distancing during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/75000-sia-illegal-border-crossings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/75000-sia-illegal-border-crossings</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>75,000 illegal immigrants flagged as having possible ties to terrorism in the last year, according to CBP data</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Customs and Border Protection flagged approximately 75,000 illegal immigrants as being possible national security threats or having terroristic ties in the previous 10 months leading up to August 2023, the Daily Caller reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBP data showed that between October 2022 and August 2023, 74,904 illegal aliens were labeled as "SIA Encounters," which stands for "Special Interest Alien."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Department of Homeland Security article, an SIA is a "non-U.S. person" who potentially "poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Often such individuals or groups are employing travel patterns known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism. DHS analysis includes an examination of travel patterns, points of origin, and/or travel segments that are tied to current assessments of national and international threat environments," the DHS stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This does not mean that all SIAs are 'terrorists,'" the government report added. However, the travel and behavior of certain individuals "indicates a possible nexus to nefarious activity (including terrorism) and, at a minimum, provides indicators that necessitate heightened screening and further investigation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unearthed numbers were a massive increase from the reported 25,627 special interest encounters from fiscal year 2022, and the comparably miniscule 3,675 from fiscal year 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal immigrants can automatically be deemed SIAs based on their country of origin, such as Turkey or Uzbekistan, due to such countries' status as a "source and transit country."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS didn&rsquo;t respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller regarding the SIA figures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBP and the DHS are under heightened scrutiny as a result of the shocking increase in border crossing encounters under the Biden administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former immigration judge claimed in late August 2023 that the DHS was deliberately not disclosing the number of illegal immigrants who have been released into the United States each month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The only reason why ICE and OFO [Office of Field Operations] would refuse to disclose that information is to hide the fact that it is releasing more than 100,000 aliens per month into the United States and to conceal the effects of those migrant releases on communities across the United States," Andrew Arthur said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border encounters in fiscal year 2023 are on pace to match the near 2.4 million that were seen in 2022. There were just over 1.7 million encounters in 2021, while in 2020, President Trump's administration saw a little more than 450,000.</span></p>

<p><strong>Electric Vehicles Are Causing Issues After Hurricane Idalia</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicles are catching on fire after Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to local reports, at least two Tesla EVs ignited after saltwater from the storm surge damaged their batteries and other electrical components. One vehicle lit up in Pinellas Park and another car fire occurred in Palm Harbor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Carfax says owners need to understand the fire risk doesn&rsquo;t go away after their EV dries out,&rdquo; ABC Actions News told viewers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The salt water that is flooding can get into the battery and dry there and once it dries it creates what federal safety officials call bridges between cells and that can lead to fires and those fires can come anywhere from days to weeks later and once an EV catches fire it is incredible difficult to put it out,&rdquo; said Patrick Olsen of Carfax.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hurricane Ian, 21 electric vehicles caught fire in the state, prompting officials to warn residents ahead of Idalia's approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We saw a number of fires associated with EVs from Hurricane Ian. We know that the saltwater from storm surge can compromise these batteries, causing fires which cannot be easily suppressed,&rdquo; Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said at the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The best fire teams can do is keep water on the battery until the fuel burns out. If you&rsquo;re evacuating and leaving an EV, or other lithium ion powered devices like scooters or golf carts in your garage, you&rsquo;re creating a real fire threat for your home, your communities, and first responders," he added. "Take this threat seriously. If there&rsquo;s even a small risk of your EV being impacted by storm surge, move it to higher ground before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One home that managed to survive Ian ended up burning to the ground because of a saltwater-damaged EV.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV vehicle owners are being advised to park affected cars at least 50 feet away from any structures that could catch fire.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Putin Won't Renew Grain Deal Until the West Meets His Demands</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that a landmark deal allowing Ukraine to export grain safely through the Black Sea amid the war won&rsquo;t be restored until the West meets Moscow's demands on its own agricultural exports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed the Kremlin&rsquo;s demands as a ploy to advance its own interests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Still, Putin's remarks dashed hopes that his talks with the Turkish President could revive an agreement seen as vital for global food supplies, especially in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russia refused to extend the deal in July, complaining that a parallel agreement promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertilizer hadn&rsquo;t been honored. It said restrictions on shipping and insurance hampered its agricultural trade, though it has shipped record amounts of wheat since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Putin reiterated those complaints Monday, while also telling reporters that if those commitments were honored, Russia could return to the deal &ldquo;within days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Turkish President also expressed hope that a breakthrough could come soon. He said Turkey and the U.N. &mdash; which both brokered the original deal &mdash; have put together a new package of proposals to unblock the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I believe that we will reach a solution that will meet the expectations in a short time,&rdquo; Erdogan said at the news conference held with Putin in the Russian resort of Sochi.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Earlier, a German Foreign Minister lashed out, saying Putin's &ldquo;game with the grain agreement is cynical.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A lot is riding on the negotiation. Ukraine and Russia are major suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other goods that developing nations rely on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Data from the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, which organized shipments under the deal, show that 57% of the grain from Ukraine went to developing nations, with the top destination being China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Grain prices shot up after Russia pulled out of the deal but have since fallen back, indicating that there isn't a big crunch in the market for the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But failure to revive the agreement will have &ldquo;drastic impacts&rdquo; in countries such as Somalia and Egypt that rely heavily on Black Sea grain, according to Galip Dalay, an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russia may be hoping it can use its power over Ukraine&rsquo;s Black Sea exports as a bargaining chip to reduce Western economic sanctions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/04/university-michigan-students-hotel-rooms-covid-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/04/university-michigan-students-hotel-rooms-covid-19/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Major University will Kick Students out of Dorms if they Gev Covid-19</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The University of Michigan (UM) is asking students who test positive for COVID-19 to get a hotel room in order to quarantine for five days, according to the university&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The university reminded students on Sept. 1 of the school&rsquo;s rules surrounding COVID-19, suggesting if they are sick stay home, wear masks and get tested, according to the website. The university also asked students to create an &ldquo;isolation plan&rdquo; in case they contract COVID-19, noting that no students are allowed in the residence halls if they test positive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This could include relocating to your permanent residence, staying with a nearby relative or friend, or finding a hotel space. Students in Michigan Housing must leave their residence halls during isolation, even if they are in a single room,&rdquo; the website reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The UM Department of Environment, Health &amp; Safety (EHS) is supposed to get in touch with the students within 24 hours to discuss the &ldquo;care and isolation options,&rdquo; according to the website. If a student must pay for a hotel room, the university did not clarify on the website whether or not they will compensate the student.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Oil prices settle at 10-month high as Saudi, Russia extend supply cuts</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Oil prices rose a dollar a barrel on Tuesday to their highest since November, after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year, worrying investors about potential shortages during peak winter demand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Brent crude futures rose by $1.04, or 1.2%, to settle at $90.04 a barrel, closing above the $90 mark for the first time since November 16, 2022. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October futures gained $1.14, or 1.3%, to settle at $86.69 a barrel, also a 10-month high.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Investors had expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend voluntary cuts into October, but the three-month extension was unexpected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would review the supply cuts monthly, and could modify them depending on market conditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;With the production cut extended, we anticipate a market deficit of more than 1.5 million barrels per day in 4Q23,&rdquo; UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo wrote in a note to clients. UBS now expects Brent crude to rise to $95 a barrel by year-end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Reflecting concerns about the short-term market supply, front month Brent and WTI contracts were also trading at their steepest premium since November to later-dated prices. This structure, called backwardation, indicates tightening supply for prompt deliveries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also supporting oil prices on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it now sees the probability of a U.S. recession starting in the next 12 months at 15%, down from an earlier forecast of 20%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Along with the Saudi supply cuts, which began in July, prospects of the U.S. economy avoiding a hard recession have helped lift oil demand and prices in recent months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both Brent and WTI futures have gained more than 20% since the end of June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In other news&hellip; have you guys been noticing Mcconell lately and his freezing episodes?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/mcconnell-physician-says-no-evidence-seizures-stroke-second-freezing-episode"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/mcconnell-physician-says-no-evidence-seizures-stroke-second-freezing-episode</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>McConnell physician says &lsquo;no evidence&rsquo; of seizures or stroke after second freezing episode</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The attending physician of the Capitol is ruling out a seizure, stroke, or other movement disorder after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) had difficulty speaking during a press conference in Kentucky last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;My examination of you following your August 30, 2023 brief episode included several medical evaluations: brain MRI imaging, EEG study and consultations with several neurologists for a comprehensive neurology assessment,&rdquo; Dr. Brian P. Monahan said in a new letter released by McConnell's office. &ldquo;There is no evidence that you have a seizure disorder or that you experienced a stroke, TIA or movement disorder such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The incident occurred last Wednesday when a reporter in Covington, Kentucky, asked him about his political plans when his term is up in 2026.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At first, the Senate Republican leader acknowledged the question but trailed off and stopped speaking. An aide stepped in and asked if he had heard the question. McConnell responded "yes" but continued to freeze. This prompted the aide to say, "We're going to need a minute."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The senator appeared to regain his composure and then briefly answered two additional questions after aides stepped in to repeat questions from reporters and then led him away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In late July, the minority leader was briefly escorted from the Senate Republicans' weekly press conference after he froze in front of the cameras, the first such public incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">McConnell, 81, was hospitalized earlier this year after suffering a fall that required him to complete physical therapy.
