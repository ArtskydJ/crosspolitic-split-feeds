<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>American Children Are Dying at Highest Rate in 50 Years</strong><strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortality rates among American children and adolescents rose by almost 20 percent in just two years, with non-COVID injuries being a top reason for increased deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2019 and 2020, all-cause mortality rates for Americans in the age group of 1 to 19 years jumped by 10.7 percent, according to data collected and published by JAMA Network from the American Medical Association. This was followed by an 8.3 percent spike between 2020 and 2021. The total mortality rate in the two years between 2019 and 2021 was 19 percent&mdash;the biggest increase in at least 50 years. &ldquo;These increases, the largest in decades, followed a period of great progress in reducing pediatric mortality rates,&rdquo; the editorial stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This reversal in the pediatric mortality trajectory was caused not by COVID-19, but by injuries,&rdquo; the editorial stated. &ldquo;In 2020, the COVID-19 mortality rate at ages 1 to 19 years was 0.24 deaths per 100 000, but the absolute increase in injury deaths alone was nearly 12 times higher (2.80 deaths per 100 000).&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2019 and 2020, injury mortality rose by 22.6 percent among those between the ages of 10 and 19, with homicides rising by 39.1 percent and drug overdose deaths jumping by 113.5 percent. Among children aged 1 to 9 years, injuries accounted for 63.7 percent of the increase in all-cause mortality in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve now reached a tipping point where the number of injury-related deaths is so high that it is offsetting many of the gains we&rsquo;ve made in treating other diseases,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Wolf, an author of the editorial and an assistant professor in the department of pediatrics at the Virginia Commonwealth University&rsquo;s School of Medicine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The editorial points out that the increase in injury deaths predates the pandemic. For instance, suicides among individuals between 10 and 19 years of age began to rise in 2007, with homicide rates starting to increase in 2013.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2007 and 2019, mortality rates for suicide rose by 69.5 percent. Between 2013 and 2019, homicide rates increased by 32.7 percent. The editorial blamed the increase in suicide and homicide rates on a &ldquo;deepening&rdquo; mental health crisis and access to firearms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fear created by the pandemic, the share of COVID-19 in deaths among children and young people (CYP) was lower when compared to other causes, according to a Jan. 30 study published in JAMA Network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study identified 821 deaths among CYP aged 0 to 19 years between August 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022, in the United States and compared it with other causes of death in 2019 prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 was ranked eighth among all causes of death within this demographic, accounting for 2 percent of all causes of death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the National Center for Health Statistics, unintentional injuries were the leading cause of death among children in 2020, accounting for 12.5 percent of deaths below the age of 12 and 31.4 percent of deaths among adolescents aged 12-17.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 accounted for 0.3 percent of deaths in children under the age of 12 and 0.8 percent of deaths among those aged 12-17.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health among children and adolescents worsened during the pandemic per a paper published in The Lancet Psychiatry that analyzed emergency department visits. The analysis found a 22 percent jump in youth visits for suicide attempts when comparing the period prior to the pandemic to the pandemic period until July 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This surge in suicide visits happened even though there was a 32 percent reduction in pediatric emergency department visits for health-related reasons during the pandemic. In addition, there was also an 8 percent increase in visits for suicidal ideation&mdash;referring to individuals who entertain suicidal thoughts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study on the National Poison Data System found that suspected suicide attempts through self-poisoning among children rose by 26.7 percent between 2015 and 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of children&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/david-strom/2023/03/15/fda-pushing-vaccine-boosters-for-infants-based-upon-trials-in-just-24-children-n537177"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/david-strom/2023/03/15/fda-pushing-vaccine-boosters-for-infants-based-upon-trials-in-just-24-children-n537177</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FDA pushing vaccine boosters for infants based upon trials in just 24 children</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA has approved the use of a new bivalent COVID-19 booster for children 6 months old to 4 years old based upon trials that included almost no children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">24 participants for the 6-month-23-month cohort, and 36 for the 2 years through 4 years old cohort. 60 children in all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are tens of millions of children in these age cohorts, and while this sort of trial is better than one where only 9 mice are given the jab, it strikes me as bizarre that the FDA is pushing this out the door and recommending that all children in America be vaccinated with a jab that has barely been tested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particularly given that the COVID virus presents almost no threat to any children those ages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European countries have pulled back from recommending or even giving COVID vaccines to people under 50, except in cases where the patient is in a high-risk category. It beggars belief that the United States FDA is still going full steam ahead recommending vaccines that are not actually approved&ndash;they are being given under an Emergency Use Authorization, not full approval&ndash;to millions of children at little risk for serious disease.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the FDA admits that there are side effects, because of course there are. There are with everything. Side effects can be justified if the benefits outweigh the downsides, but there really is no evidence that the benefits are there.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2023/03/16/biden-administration-pursuing-a-taxpayer-funded-bailout-for-moderna-n2620646"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2023/03/16/biden-administration-pursuing-a-taxpayer-funded-bailout-for-moderna-n2620646</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Biden Administration Is Trying to Bail Out Moderna</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Americans' eyes and justified outrage are aimed at the Biden administration's "not a bailout" bailout of failed banks, there's an even larger bailout &mdash; and potentially a new scandal for Biden &mdash; his administration is pursuing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the Biden Department of Justice has inserted the federal government &mdash; and with it hardworking American taxpayers &mdash; into a patent infringement dispute alleging that Moderna stole intellectual property from smaller biotech companies and used it to create and produce its COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that's since been administered more than 250 million times in the U.S. and sent the company's revenue soaring.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the two small biotech companies alleging patent infringement &mdash; called Arbutus and Genevant &mdash; Moderna stole their vaccine delivery method that uses lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to protect vaccine-introduced mRNA in the bloodstream and help ensure it reaches the intended target to become effective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderna's response to Arbutus and Genevant has not focused on the companies' claims, but sought to have the case dismissed entirely. Moderna says that, under a World War I-era law found in Section 1498 of U.S. Code, its vaccine development and production is shielded from patent claims because it was under contract to provide the vaccine to the federal government. Moderna maintains its COVID vaccine did not infringe on intellectual property, but said that "dispute is for later."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than allowing the case to play out on its own, the Biden administration &mdash; via Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss &mdash; filed a statement of interest in the dispute last month "to relieve Moderna of any liability for patent infringement resulting in performance of the &rsquo;-0100 Contract and to transfer to the United States any liability for the manufacture or use of the inventions claimed in the Patents-in-Suit resulting from the authorized and consented acts."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The "-0100 Contract" mentioned by the U.S. attorney in its statement of interest is an $8.2 billion contract between Moderna and the Department of Defense coded as "pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the Biden administration appears to be stepping in and seeking to put hardworking American taxpayers on the hook for what could be potentially billions of dollars worth of liability claims caused by Moderna's alleged theft of intellectual property to make its COVID vaccine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would the Biden administration, after the federal government has already poured billions of dollars into Moderna for its COVID vaccine, now seek to bail them out for, potentially, billions more? And why did the Biden DOJ wait until February of 2023 to file a statement of interest when the case against Moderna has been in motion since early 2022?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that's where another twist complicates the Biden DOJ's intervention and raises more questions about how the decision to intervene was made.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. attorney filed the statement of interest on behalf of the Biden DOJ on February 14 and, one day later on February 15, Moderna announced its "commitment to patient access in the United States." The company's announcement states that "Moderna remains committed to ensuring that people in the United States will have access to our COVID-19 vaccines regardless of ability to pay" and Americans who are uninsured or underinsured will still be able to get Moderna's COVID vaccines at pharmacies and doctors' offices at "no cost" to them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the company's revenue was $60 million. It increased to $803 million in 2020, then surged to more than $18 billion in 2021. It seems as though the federal government has done enough to help Moderna by now, and yet the U.S. government intervened on Moderna's behalf in the patent infringement case to say American taxpayers should assume liability for claims stemming from the company's alleged intellectual property theft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the judge hearing claims against Moderna has not sided with the company's &mdash; or the Biden DOJ's &mdash; claims that the federal government (again, read: taxpayers) should be held liable instead, and has ruled against motions to dismiss the case outright.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next week, Moderna's CEO St&eacute;phane Bancel will testify before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. That hearing, led by HELP Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT), is titled "Taxpayers Paid Billions For It: So Why Would Moderna Consider Quadrupling the Price of the COVID Vaccine?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/california-pushes-360k-person-reparations-despite-major-deficit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/california-pushes-360k-person-reparations-despite-major-deficit</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>California pushes for $360,000 per person in reparations despite major deficit</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state-endorsed California Reparations Task Force is pushing to give every black resident $360,000 in reparations despite a major budget deficit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the United States Census Bureau recorded approximately 2.251 million black people residing in California, of whom 1.8 million had at least one ancestor who was a slave, Fox News reported , making the total reparations cost around $640 billion. It is unknown where the state will come up with the funds, however, as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) reported that California is facing a budget deficit of $22.5 billion for this coming fiscal year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chas Alamo, the state's Legislative Analyst's Office's principal fiscal and policy analyst, appeared at the Reparation Task Force's second in-person meeting, in which he proposed further steps that could be taken to fulfill the reparations plan. He proposed several different paths the task force could take to make reparations state law, including the creation of a new agency that would oversee the dispensation of reparations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The creation of a new agency would be initiated through the governor's executive branch and reorganization process, but other options exist," Alamo said, California Black Media reported. "Regardless of the path, to initiate a new agency or enact any other recommendation that makes changes to state law, fundamentally both houses from the state legislature would have to approve the action and the governor will have to sign it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force is due to submit a final report and its accompanying recommendations by July 1. The state legislature, which created the commission amid the fallout from George Floyd's death in 2020, will then vote on the proposal, at which point it will be sent to Newsom to sign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, neither the panel nor any government agency has suggested how the reparations will be paid for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a separate, city-appointed reparations task force in San Francisco recommended giving $5 million in reparations to every black resident, which would total nearly $225 billion.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we begin with world news&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-jet-us-drone-collide-black-sea/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-jet-us-drone-collide-black-sea/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Russian jet collides with American drone over Black Sea, U.S. military says</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Russian Su-27 fighter jet collided with an American military drone over the Black Sea on Tuesday, the U.S. said. The collision made the drone "unflyable" and officials crashed it into the sea, the Pentagon said. The White House called the Russian plane's intercept of the unmanned aircraft "reckless."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9," U.S. Air Force General James Hecker, commander of U.S. Air Forces Europe and Air Forces Africa, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Russian fighter jets were involved in the incident, U.S. European Command said. At approximately 2:03 a.m. EDT Tuesday, one of the Russian jets struck the drone's propeller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the collision, the jets dumped fuel on the drone and flew in front of it "in a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner," European Command said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Russian jet was likely damaged in the incident but it did land afterward, said Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman. He wouldn't say where the jet landed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryder, who wouldn't say whether the drone was armed, referred to the unmanned aircraft as a MQ-9, but not a Reaper. The U.S. uses MQ-9 Reapers for both surveillance and strikes and has operated the drones in a variety of locations, including in the Middle East and Africa. Other countries, including Britain and France, also fly Reapers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reapers can be armed with Hellfire missiles as well as laser-guided bombs and can fly for more than 1,100 miles at altitudes of up to 50,000 feet, according to the Air Force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drone in Tuesday's incident was conducting an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission, Ryder said, adding that he didn't have any details to provide at the time on a possible operation to recover the drone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"To my knowledge at this point in time, the Russians have not recovered that aircraft," Ryder said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said officials were reviewing imagery from the incident to determine if any can be released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow, for its part, denied causing the drone to crash.</span></p>

<p><strong>Russia Teams Up With China And Iran For Joint Military Drills as War Tensions Rise</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three U.S. adversaries are preparing to team their offensives n a series of exercises dubbed &ldquo;Security Bond-2023.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative will run through March 19, demonstrating their naval capacity in a coordinated effort against their enemies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s Defense Ministry said the exercises would &ldquo;help deepen practical cooperation between the participating countries&rsquo; navies &hellip; and inject positive energy into regional peace and stability,&rdquo; The Guardian reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the White House has not expressed any concerns that Russia, China and Iran might using the military drills to escalate conflicts with the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. would continue monitoring the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions have been rising between the West recently due to provocative postures taken over Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and human rights abuses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. continues to sanction Iran for its Government&rsquo;s use of live ammunition on peaceful protests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Russia continues to face unprecedented sanctions and economic pressure from the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three countries stages similar military exercises in 2019 and 2022, as China has sought to strengthen its ties to nations against the U.S and expand its influence throughout the Middle East</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, China brokered a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia to end years of hostility and enter into new diplomatic relations.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Court rules against employee fired for refusing to attend LGBTQ training session</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal appellate court rejected the appeal of a former account clerk in western New York who was fired from his job for refusing to attend a mandatory LGBTQ training in 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raymond Zdunski was employed at Erie 2-Chautauqua-Cattaraugus BOCES for seven years before his termination, which he likened to "unlawful religious discrimination." He sued the organization seeking reinstatement, back pay and $10 million in damages. The Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) is a public organization that was created by the New York State Legislature in 1948 to provide shared educational programs and services to school districts within the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiff had argued that the LGBTQ training and makeup session were "aimed at changing his religious beliefs about gender and sexuality," and that attending the training "would have caused him to violate the religious teachings to which he adheres," according to the lawsuit. BOCES denied his request for a religious accommodation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">District Court Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford dismissed Zdunski's lawsuit in 2022, concluding that his claims were "unsupported" and agreeing with BOCES that he was fired for refusing to attend the trainings, which BOCES had maintained were intended to help prevent discrimination in the workplace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Plaintiff's unsupported assumption that Defendants believe him to be &lsquo;bigoted&rsquo; due to his religious beliefs is insufficient to support an inference of discrimination," Crawford said in his ruling. "In sum, no facts in the record support a finding that Mr. Zdunski was terminated because of his religion; rather, the evidence in the record supports Defendants' position that his termination was due to repeatedly refusing to attend a mandatory employee training."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zdunski's lawyer Kristina S. Heuser, meanwhile, maintained that her client's rights were violated "for no other reason than his refusal to be indoctrinated with anti-biblical teaching."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Though the lower courts did not find in his favor, we are not deterred and will seek redress from the U.S. Supreme Court," she added, according to The Buffalo News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mr. Zdunski was an account clerk," Heuser continued. "He worked on spreadsheets in a cubicle. The training was not even remotely related to the requirements of his job. The Left will stop at nothing to force their ideology upon everyone, including stripping people of their livelihood if they do not submit to their beliefs. Mr. Zdunski refused to violate his sincerely held religious beliefs by submitting to teaching that contradicts what Scripture teaches, which is his absolute right under prevailing federal law. The Court's ruling was clearly erroneous and we intend to petition the United States Supreme Court to hear Mr. Zdunski's case."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. workplaces have in recent years experienced more of a push toward diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). But a recent study found that companies are slashing DEI jobs while workers were leaving these fields at a higher rate than non-DEI positions. The study by Revelio Labs said last year companies who had layoffs cut DEI positions at a 33% rate versus a 21% cut for other roles.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Girls Basketball Team That Refused to Play Against a Transgender Athlete Banned From Sporting Events</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A private Christian school in Vermont that forfeited a girls&rsquo; basketball game against a team with a biological male &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; player has been banned from participating in upcoming sporting events.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vermont Principals&rsquo; Association, which oversees school sporting events, announced on Monday that Mid Vermont Christian School would be ineligible to participate in sporting events and other activities done through the organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The VPA again reiterates its ongoing support of transgender student-athletes as not only a part of building an inclusive community for each student to grow and thrive, but also as a clear expectation by Vermont state law(s) in the Agency of Education Best Practices, and in VPA Policy regarding transgender student athletes,&rdquo; the announcement said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the announcement included the VPA policy on &ldquo;gender identity,&rdquo; which is when a person feels like their gender does not align with their biological sex.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The VPA is committed to providing all students with the opportunity to participate in VPA activities in a manner consistent with their gender identity as is outlined in the Vermont Agency of Education Best Practices For Schools For Transgender And Gender Nonconforming Students,&rdquo; the policy said. &ldquo;The prohibition against discrimination includes discrimination based on a student&rsquo;s actual or perceived sex and gender.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to MVCS, the VPA said that it violated the organization&rsquo;s 1st and 2nd policies, which are &ldquo;commitment to racial, gender-fair and disability awareness&rdquo; and &ldquo;policy on gender identity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Townhall covered March 3 how MVCS was scheduled to compete against Long Trail School on Feb. 21, but pulled out once it learned that the opposing team included a male-bodied athlete.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players,&rdquo; Vicky Fogg, the head of MVCS, said in a statement at the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Allowing biological males to participate in women&rsquo;s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women&rsquo;s sports in general,&rdquo; Fogg added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue of male athletes who believe that they are transgender infiltrating women&rsquo;s sports has made international headlines. Last month, world-renowned surfer Bethany Hamilton, who the movie &ldquo;Soul Surfer&rdquo; is based on, said that she would no longer be competing in professional surfing if the World Surf League moved forward with its inclusive transgender policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Townhall interviewed Riley Gaines, a former swimmer at the University of Kentucky who competed against Will &ldquo;Lia&rdquo; Thomas, the biological male swimmer who began identifying as transgender and competing on the women&rsquo;s swim team at the University of Pennsylvania. At last year&rsquo;s NCAA championships, Gaines and Thomas tied in a race, but Thomas got to take the trophy home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Within the past year, in terms of progress, there has not been a clear solution to the problem [of transgender athletes] at hand. There has still been an influx of biological men competing in women&rsquo;s sports,&rdquo; Gaines, who is a spokeswoman at the Independent Women&rsquo;s Forum, told Townhall.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I think the Lia Thomas situation, bringing this to the national stage, opened a door. People see an opportunity when they see this, and they&rsquo;re willing to take advantage of it. At the expense of, of course, female athletes,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If this continues, it&rsquo;s a slippery slope. It&rsquo;s truly only a matter of time before one transgender athlete winning a national title in the women&rsquo;s category becomes three and five and 10 and so on,&rdquo; Gaines concluded. &ldquo;I think truthfully&hellip;the integrity of women&rsquo;s sports will be lost.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden issues order to strengthen gun background checks</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday aiming at increasing background checks to buy guns, promoting more secure firearms storage and ensuring U.S. law enforcement agencies get more out of a bipartisan gun control law enacted last summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic president was to address his latest efforts to curb gun violence in a speech in this suburban Los Angeles community, where a gunman stormed a dance hall and shot 20 people, killing 11, following a Lunar New Year celebration in January. He was also meeting with families of victims and with first responders from that day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s rhetoric has grown ever stronger about guns &mdash; he routinely calls for banning assault weapons &mdash; in pushing a vocal gun-control platform even tougher than during the Obama administration when he was vice president. He has been emboldened by the midterm electiions when his regular talk of gun control didn't result in massive losses, and he's expected to continue to argue for strong changes as he inches toward a 2024 reelection run, his aides say.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden was greeted at the Los Angeles airport Tuesday by Brandon Tsay, the 26-year-old who wrestled the semiautomatic pistol away from the gunman in Monterey Park. The two shook hands; Biden had invited Tsay to his State of the Union address in January where he praised the young man's heroism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the president has only limited power on guns to go beyond bipartisan legislation passed by Congress last summer after the killings last year of 10 shoppers at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store and 19 students and two teachers at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday's action does not change U.S. government policy. Rather, it directs federal agencies to ensure compliance with existing laws and procedures &mdash; a typical feature of executive orders issued by presidents when they confront the limits of their own power to act without cooperation from Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, in the order, acknowledged Congress' opposition, but said, &ldquo;In the meantime, my administration will continue to do all that we can, within existing authority, to make our communities safer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order directs the Cabinet to work on a plan to better structure the government to support communities suffering from gun violence. The plan calls on Attorney General Merrick Garland to shore up the rules for federally licensed gun dealers so they know they are required to do background checks as part of the license.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden is also mandating better reporting of ballistics data from federal law enforcement for a clearinghouse that allows federal, state and local law enforcement to match shell casings to guns. But local and state law enforcement agencies are not required to report ballistics data, and many do not, making the clearinghouse less effective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the president is asking the Federal Trade Commission to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market to minors and use military images to market to the general public.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill passed last year, known as the Safer Communities Act, is viewed by gun control advocates as a good start but one that doesn't go far enough. After the law was signed, there were 11 other mass shootings, according to a database of mass killings since 2006 maintained by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. Those killings don't include shootings in which fewer than four people were killed &mdash; and gun violence is also rising nationwide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-gun groups said the order would do little to stop growing gun violence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The reality is that nothing in the president&rsquo;s executive order today would have done anything to prevent the recent mass shootings in California, Michigan or elsewhere,&rdquo; said Katie Pointer Baney who is the Managing Director of Government Affairs for the U.S. Concealed Carry Association. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for the president and political leaders across the country to have an honest conversation with the American people and acknowledge there is no legislative fix that will permanently solve the issue of gun violence.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will also direct his Cabinet to make sure law enforcement agencies understand the benefits of the new law, particularly around red-flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders, which are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior and prevent them from hurting themselves or others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200 million to help states and the District of Columbia administer red-flag laws and other crisis-intervention programs.</span></p>

<p><strong>DeSantis Admin Moves To Revoke Liquor License From Hotel That Hosted Sexually Explicit Show For Kids</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&rsquo; administration is moving to revoke a hotel&rsquo;s liquor license after it ignored a warning and proceeded to host a sexually explicit show with children present, according to a Tuesday administrative complaint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 27, the Hyatt Regency Miami hosted &ldquo;A Drag Queen Christmas&rdquo; advertised for &ldquo;all ages&rdquo; where performers allegedly wore &ldquo;sexually suggestive clothing&rdquo; and &ldquo;prosthetic female genitalia&rdquo; while displaying &ldquo;simulated sexual activity&rdquo; in front of children, according to an administrative complaint. Prior to the show, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation warned the hotel it would lose its liquor license unless the venue ensured that children were not permitted at the event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Florida law, sexual organs cannot be exposed in public in a vulgar or indecent manner and obscene content cannot be shown to minors, the complaint stated. Violation of the law can result in the loss of a license for the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;On December 27, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation warned the Hyatt Regency Miami against hosting a sexually explicit show with children present,&rdquo; Griffin told the DCNF. &ldquo;The venue proceeded with their plans and, according to an investigation by the Department, the venue (Respondent in the complaint) violated Florida statutes as outlined in the attached complaint.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the tech giant would be laying off around 10,000 workers, with some set to find out whether or not they still have a job as early as tomorrow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move is just the latest in Zuckerberg's quest to make 2023 the "Year of Efficiency" as he and other top executives work to restructure the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech groups, he added, would find out in late April, with those in business groups being informed in late May.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zuckerberg noted that in certain cases, such as for those on international teams, layoffs could take until the end of the year to be finalized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Overall," he said, "we expect to reduce our team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven't yet hired."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zuckerberg justified the decision by explaining that "every layer of a hierarchy adds latency and risk aversion in information flow and decision-making," thus a "flatter" organization would be faster and more capable of creating, maintaining, and delivering the products and services customers want.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and fulfilling," he said. "We will become an even greater magnet for the most talented people. That&rsquo;s why in our Year of Efficiency, we are focused on canceling projects that are duplicative or lower priority and making every organization as lean as possible."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest round of layoffs come just months after Meta reduced its workforce by around 11,000 workers, or 13 percent of the workforce.</span></p>

<p><strong>'Point of No Return': NYC in Policing Crisis as Resignations Reach Record Numbers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Democrat-run cities across America continue to descend into criminal chaos, the nation&rsquo;s largest city is hemorrhaging police officers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive story last week, The New York Post published data that shows New York City (NYC) police officers are resigning from their duties at a shocking rate. Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch called it a &ldquo;staffing emergency&rdquo; that is &ldquo;approaching the point of no return.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statistics show a 117% increase in retiring officers since 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shocking stats show 239 officers tapped out in January and February, a 36% spike from the 176 who fled in the same period last year and a disturbing 117% jump from the 110 in 2021, NYPD pension data show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s the highest number of resignations for the first two months of a year since 250 members quit in 2007 during a contentious contract dispute.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, there seem to be a number of converging factors contributing to the massive loss of personnel in the Big Apple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Lives Matter-led movement to defund police departments across the country has almost certainly created a combination of shrinking budgets to retain employees and a strain on remaining resources. However, corruption and poor management also seems to be a debilitating issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A veteran Manhattan police officer told the Post that precinct cops have to work &ldquo;an inhumane amount of overtime&rdquo; that often includes their days off. At the same time, they are penalized by department bureaucrats for small breaches of uniform and/or administrative protocol. Meanwhile, some officers are being protected from necessary patrol duties by &ldquo;high-ranking supervisors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYPD officers are fleeing to places like Florida, or suburban locations in New York and Connecticut. As the cost of living in NYC sky-rockets, pay remains stagnant. There is also the rapidly declining quality of life. Prolonged school closures, COVID vaccine mandates and unnecessary masking of small children has led to a learning crisis in government schools. A notoriously &lsquo;woke&rsquo; agenda in those same schools has also begun to affect testing levels and education outcomes. Rampant homelessness and open-air drug use make for unsafe streets and public transportation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According the report from The New York Post, 262 city cops retired in just the first two months of 2023, a 3% increase in retirements in the same time period last year. Perhaps the most alarming number uncovered in the report reveals that the NYPD lost 3701 officers in 2022 alone. It is the largest number of officers lost since 2002, following the 9/11 attacks. That year the city lost 3,846 police officers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things don&rsquo;t seem to be looking up any time soon.</span></p>

<p><strong>1.3 Million Guns Sold Last Month: Firearms Sales Still Near Record Levels</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Gun Sales Pass One Million Mark for 43rd Month in a Row in February &ndash; Though sales are down from their record highs of 2020 and 2021, guns are still in hot demand based on the latest retail data and FBI background checks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the firearm industry trade association, sales of firearms surpassed 1.3 million units in February &ndash; even with fewer days on the calendar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, sales had declined just 0.6 percent compared to February 2022 &ndash; based on NSSF-adjusted data from the FBI&rsquo;s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Though not a direct correlation to gun sales, the NSSF-adjusted NICS data provide an additional picture of current market conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">February was the 43rd month in a row to see gun sales exceed a million units.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover announced they would pause their plan to implement a new merchant category code for the nation&rsquo;s gun retailers after political pressure from Republicans, CNN reported.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Resigning Over Bible Quote, Texas Tech Settles for $4.1M Payout for Coach Mark Adams</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now former Texas Tech basketball coach Mark Adams and the university have come to terms with a $4.1 million payout after Adams resigned for using a Bible quote about slaves and masters during a training session with a student.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Red Raiders coach resigned after using a Bible quote, Ephesians, 6:5-9, to encourage a player during a training session. The passage begins, &ldquo;Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not known if Adams actually used the word &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; when he quoted the verse, but it was quickly deemed offensive, and the school suspended him for using it as a training tool.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams seemed to feel it was not a big deal and that it was all blown up out of proportion. He was suspended, regardless. But, despite that the school said he apologized, he later contradicted that and said he did not apologize.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Adams resigned only a few days after the incident was first reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bible quote was not the only issue Adams was facing with school officials. He was also accused of spitting on a player, but he fully denied that claim.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the veracity of the accusations against him, Adams and Texas Tech have now settled on his separation package.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school has agreed to pay Adams $4.1 million in thirty days. The payout will include all bonuses and salaries earned during the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two also agreed to forego any legal actions over the incident and to hold each other blameless going forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Adams hereby agrees to the release of any and all claims against TTU and Texas Tech University System and their employees, appointees, regents and representatives relating to his employment, whether known or unknown, as of the date of this Agreement and TTU agrees to release any and all claims against Adams,&rdquo; the school&rsquo;s settlement reads, according to USA Today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This Agreement is not, and shall not in any way be construed, as an admission by the Parties of wrongdoing whatsoever against each other or that the Parties violated any federal, state or local law, which both Parties deny,&rdquo; the statement added.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden says Americans should 'feel confident' in banking system after federal response to SVB collapse</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Biden says Americans should "feel confident" in their banking system after his administration's response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden reiterated a statement from the FDIC and Treasury Department during public remarks Monday morning, telling reporters that the federal government would guarantee depositors at the banks access to their funds. He added that no such protection is being offered to the banks' investors, however. His administration has also fired the leadership at both banks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"No losses will be borne by the taxpayers," Biden emphasized. "Instead, the money will come from the fees that banks pay into the deposit insurance fund. Because of the actions that our regulators have already taken, every American should feel confident that their deposits will be there if and when they need them."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden went on to call on Congress to pass legislation to "strengthen rules" on banks to prevent failures like SVB and Signature.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Clara, California-based band collapsed last week and is now under the control of federal regulators. The SVB had been the 16th-largest bank in the U.S. prior to the bank run that led to its downfall.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Anxious depositors rushed to withdraw their money over concern for the bank&rsquo;s health, causing its collapse, which may serve as "an extinction-level event for startups," according to Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Biden administration had earlier assured SVB depositors that they would have access to all of their funds on Sunday. The joint statement from the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also emphasized that the action would come at no cost to US taxpayers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system," the joint statement said. "This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden delivered his Monday remarks in a short briefing before traveling to California, where he is set to announce the sale of nuclear submarines to Australia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/03/13/biden-desantis-florida-transgender-kids-sinful-national-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/03/13/biden-desantis-florida-transgender-kids-sinful-national-law/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&lsquo;Close To Sinful&rsquo;: Biden Floats Possibility Of Nation-Wide Transgender Law</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden appeared to criticize Ron DeSantis on his handling of transgender youth and floated the possibility of a nation-wide transgender law in an interview clip released Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on in Florida, is as my mother would say, &lsquo;close to sinful.&rsquo; I mean, it&rsquo;s just terrible what they&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; Biden said while speaking with actor Kal Penn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://youtu.be/9CtCG3qLjPY"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Kal Penn previews interview with Biden, discusses guest-hosting \&quot;The Daily Show\&quot;&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/9CtCG3qLjPY&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Kal Penn previews interview with Biden, discusses guest-hosting "The Daily Show"</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Play 2:12-2:56</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">DeSantis has led an administration-wide effort to ban sex change treatments for minors. He has said doctors should be sued for performing sex changes on children and suspended a state attorney refusing to adhere to the child sex change ban.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">DeSantis also requested public universities report how many students they treated for &ldquo;gender dysphoria,&rdquo; and in October, the Florida Board of Medicine voted to ban sex change surgeries and hormone therapy for children under 18.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Dylan Mulvaney, a man who identifies as a woman and has garnered attention on social media for using hyper-feminine stereotypes, asked Biden in October if he thinks states should &ldquo;have the right&rdquo; to ban &ldquo;gender-affirming health care.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any state or anybody should have the right to do that, as a moral question and a legal question,&rdquo; Biden responded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I just think it&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Biden added. &ldquo;I feel very, very strongly that you should have every single solitary right, including, including use of your gender identity bathroom in public.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/videos/women-now-binge-drinking-more-than-men-for-first-time-in-history-doctor-warns"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/videos/women-now-binge-drinking-more-than-men-for-first-time-in-history-doctor-warns</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Women now binge drinking more than men for first time in history, doctor warns</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">For the first time in history, women are outpacing men in binge drinking, which is a growing concern among health officials as overall drinking for young adults is on the rise. As the pandemic came to an end, they seem to be drinking more than ever.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In 2020, during the pandemic, we saw a continuing decline in binge drinking among college-age students. Most were isolated or at home as classes moved online. Group activities or parties where drinking would be prevalent simply were not happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;In 2021, there has been an uptick, particularly among women. Now it turns out on college campuses women are actually binge drinking more than men, for the first time in history,&rdquo; said Dr. George F. Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Koob said while drinking overall was down during the pandemic, deaths associated with alcohol were up 25% for not just college students but the general population. Koob believes isolation contributed to mental health problems and substance abuse across the board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, now we&rsquo;re back. People are going to parties, and colleges and bars are open again. Restaurants are serving bottomless brunch, and wineries and breweries are ready to pour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what we call the alcohol deprivation effect. People tend to really rebound in drinking after a period of not drinking.&rdquo; Koob said. &ldquo;We are a little concerned that this spring and spring break is going to be a return to a good amount of binge drinking. I just want to caution everyone that when you start hitting the binge drinking level you start doing really bad things to your body.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">So, where does this leave this new group of women who are binge drinking more than ever before? Koob said knowing what a standard drink is and your limit is important to taking care of your health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As social media trends encourage dangerous &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; to binge drinking, including the viral &ldquo;BORGs&rdquo; or &ldquo;blackout rage gallons&rdquo; which combine water, electrolytes, and vodka, TikTok is specifically pushing the misconception that this drink will keep you hydrated while drinking copious amounts of liquor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Massive fight among 200 students, parents at Louisiana high school ends in 10 arrests</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An explosive fight at a Louisiana high school among nearly 200 students and parents ended with several cops injured and at least 10 arrests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Swarms of police officers responded early March 8 to a &ldquo;major campus disturbance&rdquo; at East Baton Rouge Readiness Alternative School, finding a loaded gun abandoned on the ground, WBRZ reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Officials say one fight broke out and escalated, spilling out into the school&rsquo;s courtyard and gym. By the time police arrived, there were about 200 people involved in brawls across the campus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Videos of the chaos taken inside the school&rsquo;s gym show chairs getting tossed and students being detained by law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">One shocking video shows a sheriff&rsquo;s deputy forcefully hitting a student&rsquo;s face into a brick wall. The officer was trying to arrest a 17-year-old student, authorities said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police said the teen had punched the officer in the face and tried to bite him, which led to the aggressive encounter captured on video. The teen was among those charged with battery on an officer and resisting arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Officials have not yet determined what triggered the massive melee at the school, which enrolls students who&rsquo;ve been previously suspended or expelled from other district schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The NAACP released a statement Wednesday saying it was reviewing videos from the incident to decide if the aggressive police response captured on video was appropriate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The fight allegedly started with a small group of students but escalated into a larger clash involving parents and students fighting police as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">One witness told WBRZ the brawl erupted when a girl who wasn&rsquo;t a student at the school and her mom showed up to fight another girl &mdash; and that it escalated from there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Students were allegedly locked inside the gym during the fight. One responding police officer sustained injuries including a broken hip and head lacerations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also among those arrested were three students charged with battery on a police officer, a felony.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Five other students were arrested for disturbing the peace, including an 18-year-old girl who was arrested on counts of unlawful disruption of the operation of a school and resisting arrest, and a 17-year-old girl hit with disturbing the peace and resisting arrest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">All of those arrested were students between 15 and 18. None of the parents or other adults at the scene were taken into custody.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/americas/mexico-matamoros-us-citizens-kidnapping-tuesday/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/americas/mexico-matamoros-us-citizens-kidnapping-tuesday/index.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>2 Americans kidnapped in Mexico found dead and 2 found alive, officials say</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Two of the four Americans kidnapped by armed gunmen in the Mexico border city of Matamoros on Friday were found dead and two were found alive on Tuesday, US and Mexican officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown were found dead, a US official familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN. Their bodies will be examined by Mexican authorities prior to their remains being turned over to the US government, the official said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Latavia Washington McGee, a mother of six, and Eric Williams survived the ordeal, according to the official. They were taken to a Texas hospital for treatment and observation. A Mexican government official said Washington McGee was found uninjured. Williams was shot twice in one leg and once in the other, his wife, Michele Williams, told CNN Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">One person has been detained in connection to the incident, the governor said, but officials would not confirm whether the person is related to a criminal organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The victims were found in a &ldquo;wooden house&rdquo; in Matamoros and had been transferred to various places over the days &ldquo;in order to create confusion and avoid rescue efforts,&rdquo; Villarreal said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The discovery of the Americans&rsquo; whereabouts comes days after the four were abducted at gunpoint in Matamoros in what is believed to be a case of mistaken identity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The tight-knit group of friends traveled from South Carolina to Mexico so Washington McGee could undergo a medical procedure across the border Friday, but they never made it to the appointment, two family members told CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The group crossed into Matamoros in the state of Tamaulipas, at about 9:18 a.m. Friday, Villareal said, but they got lost while trying to locate the medical clinic, according to Washington McGee&rsquo;s close friend, who did not want to be identified. They reached out to the doctor&rsquo;s office for directions on Friday but were struggling to communicate with the office because they had a poor cellphone signal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After crossing the border, they were fired upon by unidentified gunmen, &ldquo;placed in a vehicle and taken from the scene by armed men,&rdquo; according to the FBI.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Investigators believe the Americans were targeted by a Mexican cartel that likely mistook them for Haitian drug smugglers, the US official said. The US citizens have no concerning criminal history that has been identified by investigators, the official said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An innocent Mexican bystander was also killed in the encounter, US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar said. The woman was hit by a stray bullet almost a block and a half from where the Americans were taken, Tamaulipas Gov. Am&eacute;rico Villarreal said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Their abduction highlights the ongoing violence that has plagued some Mexican cities during the long-running Mexican drug war as well as the growing business of &ldquo;medical tourism.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Matamoros has a population of more than 500,000 people and is located just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. The US State Department has issued a &ldquo;Level 4: Do Not Travel&rdquo; advisory for US citizens thinking of going to Tamaulipas, citing crime and kidnapping.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Steven Crowder moves his show to Rumble, signs new contract</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Steven Crowder has joined Rumble, making the announcement on Russell Brand's Stay Free.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Crowder, who recently made waves in the conservative and free speech media space after leaving The Blaze, entertaining an offer from The Daily Wire, then very publicly rejecting it, will be launching his Mug Club on Rumble on March 20.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Crowder said that in addition to his own content, the Mug Club will be adding more talent and programming. Brand asked Crowder why he decided to come to Rumble, where Brand has moved as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Crowder, describing himself as "a basic bitch pumpkin spice conservative," said his preference for Rumble was due to the fact that Rumble has never coming and "tried to dictate content." Crowder also said he wants to be on a platform where he can "speak truth," as opposed to being censored by YouTube.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a Twitter clip, Crowder showed himself signing the contract at Rumble's offices. "Betting on ourselves, and Rumble is a hedge on those bets," Crowder said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1633290721863032834"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1633290721863032834</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Donald Trump Jr. recently launched his exclusive podcast on Rumble, a free-speech alternative to YouTube that went public in late 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-judge-rules-bidens-border-policies-unlawful-speedbump-illegal-migrants"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-judge-rules-bidens-border-policies-unlawful-speedbump-illegal-migrants</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Federal judge rules Biden's border policies unlawful, just a 'speedbump' for illegal migrants</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A federal judge in Florida on Wednesday struck down the Biden administration&rsquo;s use of parole to mass release migrants into the U.S. interior, finding the practice unlawful and accusing the administration of turning the border into a "meaningless line in the sand."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Judge T. Kent Wetherell ruled in response to a lawsuit from the state of Florida, which alleged the administration&rsquo;s mass release of tens of thousands of migrants via humanitarian parole into Alternatives to Detention &mdash; known as "Parole + ATD" &mdash; is unlawful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a scathing opinion Wednesday, Wetherell stated the Biden administration had "effectively turned the Southwest Border into a meaningless line in the sand and little more than a speedbump for aliens flooding into the country."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Additionally, Wetherell ruled that the policies implemented by the Biden administration, including catch and release, had contributed to the degradation of the border as a means to keep illegal migrants out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Today&rsquo;s ruling affirms what we have known all along, President Biden is responsible for the border crisis and his unlawful immigration policies make this country less safe. A federal judge is NOW ordering Biden to follow the law, and his administration should immediately begin securing the border to protect the American people," Republican Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said in a statement following the ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The administration had been increasingly using parole &mdash; which the statute says is supposed to be used on a "case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit" &mdash; to release migrants quickly into the interior to reduce overcrowding at the border as it deals with historic migrant numbers at the border. Florida contended that the government is violating statutory mandates that migrants be detained. The administration had argued that there is no "non-detention policy" and that it is using its prosecutorial discretion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"There is nothing inherently inhumane or cruel about detaining aliens pending completion of their immigration proceedings," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The judge also sided with the Sunshine State in its argument that it had standing to challenge the policy as more than 100,000 migrants have been released into the state, and it has borne significant costs in providing public services to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Biden administration ended family detention of migrants in 2021, although it is reportedly considering reintroducing the practice when Title 42 ends in May. Title 42, which allows for the rapid expulsion of migrants at the southern border due to COVID-19, will end in May with the ending of the COVID-19 public health emergency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The administration, facing more than 1.7 million migrant encounters in FY 2021 and over 2.3 million in FY 2022, had looked for ways to more quickly release migrants into the U.S. interior, as it also ended Trump-era policies like the Migrant Protection Protocols, which kept migrants in Mexico for their immigration hearings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The administration typically released migrants with Notices to Appear that set a court date. However, the process takes much longer than the Parole + ATD, which tells migrants to check in with ICE when they get to their destination. The migrants are also enrolled into some form of ATD surveillance, typically a check-in app on an electronic device, or in some cases an ankle bracelet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The ruling stays the order for seven days to allow for an appeal, but could potentially have massive implications if there is a surge in migrants when Title 42 ends &mdash; as administration officials have previously predicted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The administration is also facing a looming lawsuit from GOP states over its humanitarian parole that flies in up to 30,000 migrants from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Haiti and Cuba each month. Those states have said the program breaches the statutory limits on the use of parole.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile, it could soon face a challenge over its recently announced asylum rule. That rule, which would automatically make migrants ineligible for asylum if they have entered the U.S. illegally and have also failed to claim asylum in a previous country through which they passed, has sparked outrage from immigration activists, some of whom have threatened to take legal action if the rule is finalized.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former UK Health Secretary Asks When To &lsquo;Deploy The New Variant,&rsquo; Messages Show</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former United Kingdom Health Minister Matt Hancock asked when to &ldquo;deploy&rdquo; a new COVID-19 variant in December 2020, leaked personal messages reportedly show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Whatsapp conversation, leaked to The Telegraph by anti-lockdown journalist Isabel Oakeshott, shows an exchange between Hancock and an aide back in December 2020 in which the ex-Health Secretary discusses plans to deploy the announcement for the new variant, the BBC reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We frighten the pants of everyone with the new strain,&rdquo; Hancock reportedly says, to which the adviser responds, &ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s what will get proper behaviour change.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;When do we deploy the new variant,&rdquo; the minister then asks the aide, according to the outlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hancock announced the new variant in a parliament session the following day, after the messages were exchanged, according to the BBC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In April of 2022, Hancock announced he was working on a book, titled &ldquo;Pandemic Diaries,&rdquo; that would detail his experience as health minster during the COVID-19 outbreak. Oakeshott assisted with the book, which was published in December 2022, according to the BBC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;There is absolutely no public interest case for this huge breach. All the materials for the book have already been made available to the Inquiry, which is the right, and only, place for everything to be considered properly and the right lessons to be learned. As we have seen, releasing them in this way gives a partial, biased account to suit an anti-lockdown agenda,&rdquo; Hancock said in a statement responding to the leaked messages, the BBC reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced criticism for breaking lockdown restrictions. Johnson and his wife, as well as current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, all received a fine for attending a birthday party back in June 2020, the BBC reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It&rsquo;s concerning to think that the left may actually believe their own hyperbole.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Addressing Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s new segments on the mostly peaceful January 6th protest, which is based on over 40,000 hours of footage he obtained via Kevin McCarthy, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre made it clear that she &ldquo;disagrees&rdquo; with his reporting, before presenting January 6th as the worst thing to happen to America since the Civil War.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tucker Releases Bombshell Jan 6 Footage Showing EVERYTHING the Media and Dems Said Was a LIE</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">New video released by Tucker Carlson has revealed that once again, the liberal media and Democrat establishment lied about everything when it came to the events on January 6, 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Among the revelations from Carlson&rsquo;s reporting was that the man that has become the face of January 6, the so-called &ldquo;QAnon Shaman,&rdquo; was led through the Capitol building by police the entire time he was in the building, including them escorting him to the Senate floor. This is contrary to the media portrayal of him as a &ldquo;violent insurrectionist.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://rumble.com/v2c13x8-tucker-releases-bombshell-jan-6-footage-showing-everything-the-media-and-de.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v2c13x8-tucker-releases-bombshell-jan-6-footage-showing-everything-the-media-and-de.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In perhaps the damning revelation, the extent to which Democrats lied about the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick was worse than initially thought. Not only did they lie about him being beaten to death by protesters (when in fact he died of natural causes), he was captured on video alive after he was supposedly &ldquo;murdered.&rdquo; He was also seen&nbsp; wearing a helmet, making it even more unlikely that he died of a head injury as some falsely reported</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://rumble.com/v2c3bkg-new-jan-6-footage-proves-dems-lied-about-death-of-officer-brian-sicknick.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v2c3bkg-new-jan-6-footage-proves-dems-lied-about-death-of-officer-brian-sicknick.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The new footage also proved that Ray Epps, who is widely suspected to be a federal informant who helped instigate January 6, lied to the January 6 Committee about when he left the Capitol that day - though the Committee didn&rsquo;t seem to care much about being lied to when it came from Epps.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">NYC Mayor Eric Adams: Business Should Require Customers to Unmask Upon Entering to Help Fight Crime</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">New York City Mayor Eric Adams has called on the city&rsquo;s businesses to require unmasking upon entry. The move comes as authorities have noted mask-wearing in public places has made it easier for criminals to obscure their identities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We are putting out a clear call to all of our shops, do not allow people to enter the store without taking off their face mask,&rdquo; Adams said in a recent radio interview with 1010 WINS. &ldquo;And then once they&rsquo;re inside, they can continue to wear if they so desire to do so. But we need to use the technology we have available to identify those shoplifters and those who are committing serious crimes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At a February 28 press conference concerning a jewelry store robbery in which police say a 78-year-old worker was brutally beaten by the suspects &mdash; one of them masked &mdash; New York City Police Chief Jeffrey Maddrey called on the city&rsquo;s business community to require unmasking as a &ldquo;condition of entry&rdquo;:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The NYPD is here to work with our businesses, but I have to ask our businesses to be just as proactive as well. We&rsquo;re seeing far too often where people are coming up to our businesses, sometimes with masks, sometimes with masks, hoods, and latex gloves&hellip; and then we have a robbery or some kind of property being stolen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Maddrey explained that unmasking could serve as a &ldquo;peace offering&rdquo; to workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox 5 reported Monday that police had linked the murder of a 67-year-old bodega worker during a robbery to three other robberies. Police say that in each case the suspect was masked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Staying in NYC&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/nyc-spends-10-million-per-day-to-house-feed-illegal-immigrants-report?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/nyc-spends-10-million-per-day-to-house-feed-illegal-immigrants-report?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">NYC spends $10 MILLION per day to house, feed illegal immigrants</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">New York City is having to deal with an immense financial burden as it continues to spend millions per day to provide housing and food for thousands of illegal immigrants, with the city having received minimal aid from President Joe Biden and New York State Governor Kathy Hochul.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The city's Emergency Management Commissioner, Zach Iscol, disclosed the high cost during a City Council panel meeting, where he said that the Department of Homeless Services and Health &amp; Hospital spent, on average, reports the New York Post, $363 per day for a single illegal migrant's shelter and food. Over 30,000 illegal migrants are currently housed in the city's taxpayer-funded facilities, the Post reported, with that bill amounting to over $10 million, per day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">City Hall told the Post "there are 12,700 households currently in our care," with the minimum daily cost of taking care of the illegal immigrants being placed at $4,622,800.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Iscol warned the City Council's Committee on Contracts that the city is at the end of its resources, and the situation is not sustainable. The temporary Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Centers set up by the city to deal with the influx are not viable solutions, he said, emphasizing that the city has reached out for help from both state and federal governments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Very little has been provided by the state or the Biden regime in terms of financial aid.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided the city with a mere $8 million in December, which is not even enough to cover two current days' costs. City Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli expressed frustration, with Borelli stating that the Biden administration should take responsibility for the situation and provide financial aid to the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The New York National Guard has been deployed to a minor degree to aid with the influx of illegal immigrants. Hochul has promised $1 billion in aid to the city for the crisis in her state budget, though the city will have to pay a third of the amount. The federal government has yet to commit to funding any amount of aid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/03/06/iowa-bill-college-diversity-efforts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/03/06/iowa-bill-college-diversity-efforts/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Iowa Bill Would Bankrupt All College Diversity Programs</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An Iowa bill introduced Sunday would end higher education institutions&rsquo; diversity programs, prohibiting colleges from spending money on such efforts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House File 616 would prohibit public higher education institutions governed by the Iowa Board of Regents from funding diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and would bar the universities from hiring DEI officers. The bill, introduced by the Iowa Committee on Education, would require the money that would have been spent on DEI efforts go towards merit scholarships for lower-income and middle-income students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Universities are not permitted to spend any grants, tuition, endowments and gifts on DEI policies, programming, training, activities and positions, the bill stated. Under the legislation, the state&rsquo;s attorney general can oversee the universities efforts to axe diversity efforts and punish the schools if they fail to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The legislation comes among other education efforts within the state; the legislature is considering an Iowa bill that would prohibit teachers from giving lessons &ldquo;relating to gender identity&rdquo; in K-8 public and charter school classrooms. In January, Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed House Study Bill 1 into law, creating a school choice program that gives vouchers to students outside of the public school system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The Board of Regents opposes the bill,&rdquo; Josh Lehman, Iowa Board of Regents senior communications director, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. &ldquo;We have concerns with the bill&rsquo;s language and impact, and will work with legislators directly to address them. We will continue to track the bill as it makes its way through the legislative process.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Iowa Committee on Education did not immediately respond to the DCNF&rsquo;s request for comment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Before we go, let&rsquo;s see how Canada&rsquo;s doing!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-trudeau-pledges-5-5-million-to-fight-disinformation-after-accusations-ccp-infiltrated-canadian-elections?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-trudeau-pledges-5-5-million-to-fight-disinformation-after-accusations-ccp-infiltrated-canadian-elections?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trudeau pledges $5.5 million to fight 'disinformation' after accusations CCP infiltrated Canadian elections</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he will appoint an "Independent special rapporteur," who he says will have a "wide mandate and will make expert recommendations on combating interference and strengthening our democracy" amid allegations that his government ignored recommendations from CSIS noting concerns about candidates' connections to the Chinese Communist Party.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trudeau said that foreign interference was felt in US and France's elections in 2016 and 2017, respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1632880023743889408"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1632880023743889408</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trudeau then announced that $5.5 million would be invested to "build capacity of civil society organizations to combat disinformation," adding that "disinformation often generated abroad can be a real threat to our elections, and it's a threat that the federal government cannot combat alone."</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, March 7th, 2023. I hope you all had a fantastic weekend with you and yours! Before we get to the news&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In world news, we visit Greece.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-03-05/thousands-protest-in-athens-after-greeces-deadly-train-crash"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-03-05/thousands-protest-in-athens-after-greeces-deadly-train-crash</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greeks Protest Over Deadly Train Crash, Station Master Jailed Pending Trial</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATHENS (Reuters) -A Greek railway employee was jailed on Sunday pending trial over a deadly train crash that killed at least 57 people, as Greeks seethed with anger over the worst rail disaster in living memory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protests continued to reverberate days after a head-on collision of a passenger train and a freight carrier on the Athens-Thessaloniki route late in the evening of Feb. 28.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clashes erupted between police and demonstrators in Athens on Sunday, after thousands rallied to protest over the crash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 59-year-old Larissa station master faces multiple charges of disrupting transport and putting lives at risk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man, who cannot be named under Greek law, was questioned for seven hours before a magistrate on Sunday before being detained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"For about 20 cursed minutes he was responsible for the safety of the whole of central Greece," his lawyer said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, his lawyer said that his client was devastated and had assumed responsibility "proportionate to him" but other factors were also at play, without elaborating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Railway workers say the country's rail network has been creaking under cost-cutting and underinvestment, a legacy of Greece's debilitating debt crisis from 2010 to 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister of transportation, who blamed the crash on human error, acknowledged that decades of neglect could have contributed to the disaster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"As prime minister, I owe everyone, but most of all the relatives of the victims, an apology," he wrote on his Facebook account. "Justice will very fast investigate the tragedy and determine liabilities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After protests over the past three days across the country, some 10,000 people gathered in an Athens square on Sunday to express sympathy for the lives lost and to demand better safety standards on the rail network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"That crime won't be forgotten," protesters shouted as they released black balloons into the sky. A placard read: "Their policies cost human lives."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Railway workers' unions say safety systems throughout the rail network have been deficient for years as a remote surveillance and signalling system has not been delivered on time. They have called on the government to provide a timetable for the implementation of safety protocols.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime minister of transportation said on Sunday that if there had been a remote system in place throughout the rail network "it would have been, in practice, impossible for the accident to happen".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man arrested after allegedly trying to open emergency door on plane and stabbing flight attendant</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Massachusetts man was arrested for allegedly attempting to stab a flight attendant in the neck with a broken metal spoon three times during a flight from Los Angeles to Boston on Monday, after attempting to open an emergency exit door, according to the Justice Department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francisco Severo Torres, 33, faces one charge of interference and attempted interference with flight crew members and attendants using a dangerous weapon. Torres was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport Monday and will remain detained pending a hearing set for Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a United Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Boston, the flight crew saw an alarm that a door in the plane had been disarmed and, after inspection, a flight attendant saw the door&rsquo;s locking handle had been pushed out of the fully locked position and an emergency slide arming lever had been disarmed, according to the Justice Department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A flight attendant who saw Torres near the door went to talk to Torres about the door, according to the department, who asked if there were cameras showing he had tampered with the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;According to court documents, the flight attendant then notified the captain that they believed Torres posed a threat to the aircraft and that the captain needed to land the aircraft as soon as possible,&rdquo; the Justice Department said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, Torres allegedly got out of his seat, mouthing something, before thrusting &ldquo;towards one of the flight attendants in a stabbing motion with a broken metal spoon, hitting the flight attendant on the neck area three times,&rdquo; the department said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres was then tackled by other passengers on the flight and was immediately taken into custody after the flight landed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a criminal complaint, Torres told investigators he broke a spoon in half a bathroom on the airplane to use as a weapon. He also told law enforcement that he tried to open the emergency door and &ldquo;had gotten the idea&rdquo; to jump out of the plane, according to the complaint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres told investigators he was trying to defend himself and tried to stab the flight attendant because he believed they were trying to kill him, the complaint states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flight attendant felt the object Torres was holding in his hand &ldquo;hit him on his shirt collar and tie three times,&rdquo; according to the complaint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Airlines says it has banned Torres from flying on future flights following this incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/03/06/one-third-biden-2020-voters-do-not-want-him-run-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/03/06/one-third-biden-2020-voters-do-not-want-him-run-again/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poll: One-Third of Biden 2020 Voters Do Not Want Him to Run Again</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than one-third of Biden 2020 voters do not want him to run for reelection in 2024, a recent survey from YouGov/The Economist revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found 58 percent, overall, revealing they do not want President&nbsp; Joe Biden to run for office again in 2024, while 24 percent said they do. Another 18 percent remain unsure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictably, opinions are divided along party lines, as 83 percent of Republicans and 59 percent of independents do not want him to run. Less than a majority of Democrats, 43 percent, believe Biden should run in 2024, while more than one-third, 34 percent, said he should not. Another 23 percent of Democrats remain unsure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, over one-third of Biden 2020 voters, 36 percent, do not want him to run in the next presidential race, while less than a majority, 39 percent, said he should. One-quarter of Biden 2020 voters remain unsure. For further comparison, most Trump 2020 voters, 55 percent, want former President Donald Trump to run in 2024, and 53 percent of Republicans across the board say the same.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey was taken February 25-28, 2023, among 1,500 U.S. adult citizens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It coincides with other polls showing Biden&rsquo;s inability to win over a majority of Democrats to support his potential 2024 presidential bid. A recent Fox News survey, for instance, found 53 percent of Democrat voters asserting that &ldquo;someone else&rdquo; should be their nominee in the forthcoming presidential election, compared to 37 percent who said &ldquo;keep Biden&rdquo; as the nominee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Breitbart News reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article added further perspective to Biden&rsquo;s figures among the Democrat base, noting that Trump saw far more support from his Republican base at the same point in his presidency, as 72 percent of Republican voters wanted to see him as the GOP nominee again in 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, a McLaughlin &amp; Associates survey released last month found just more than a quarter, 26 percent, supporting Biden in a crowded Democrat field.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AG pushes state level 'Ministry of Truth' critics say could jail conservatives who express mainstream views</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state attorney general is advocating for a bill some critics argue could punish outspoken conservatives as domestic extremists, KTTH's Jason Rantz reported Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Some conservative views, or anything [Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson] deems as 'misinformation,' are examples of 'domestic extremism,'" Rantz said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's the "most dangerous bill in legislative history," the Seattle radio host added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington is creating a state version of the ill-fated "Ministry of Truth," according to Rantz and others who have analyzed the bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversial bill proposes the establishment of a commission on domestic violence extremism. Rep. Bill Ramos, a Democrat, sponsored the bill which would create the 13-member commission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1333 describes the duties of the proposed commission as involving efforts to "combat disinformation and misinformation" and collecting data on incidents of "domestic violent extremism," the Center Square explains.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though DVE is not explicitly defined in the bill, Ferguson has described the term as including noncriminal activities or speech, the outlet also says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation was spawned by the Attorney General's 2022 "Domestic Terrorism" study, according to Center Square. That study warned that "effective State intervention to address these threats has the potential to implicate speech or association that may be protected by the First Amendment, or the individual right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, the commission, though charged with examining ways to treat DVE as a public health issue through the state's Department of Health, would have only one member required to be an expert in public health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic idea is to "take preemptive measures to stop actual domestic terrorist acts through community intervention."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such "community intervention" could include, for example, compelling people identified as "extremists" to undergo counseling, according to Rantz's interpretation of comments Ferguson made in an interview with PBS in January.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rantz went on to explain that opposing critical race theory, mask mandates, and radical gender ideology could all be seen by the commission as tied to "white supremacy."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now lastly, let&rsquo;s end on some good news:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/walgreens-wont-distribute-abortion-pill-in-21-states-spokesperson-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/walgreens-wont-distribute-abortion-pill-in-21-states-spokesperson-says</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walgreens Won&rsquo;t Distribute Abortion Pill In 21 States, Spokesperson Says</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American pharmacy chain Walgreens faced backlash over the weekend after announcing it would not sell abortion pills in states where the drugs remain legal after nearly two dozen Republican state attorney generals threatened legal action against the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walgreens, the second-largest pharmaceutical chain in the United States, told Politico last week they would not dispense abortion pills either by mail or at locations in 21 states, including Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, and Montana, where the drug is legal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision followed a letter from 20 Republican attorneys general last month, who warned of violating state laws if the company mailed out abortion pills. Several other pharmacies, including CVS, Walmart, and Costco, also received a similar letter from those state officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the announcement, Business Insider reported the phrases &ldquo;Walgreens&rdquo; and &ldquo;#BoycottWalgreens&rdquo; trended on Twitter as critics called on consumers to stop supporting the pharmacy &mdash; which cited tweets from one of President Joe Biden&rsquo;s aides, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, and Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) &mdash; all calling on the pharmacy to reverse its decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristi Hamrick, a spokesperson for Students for Life, praised Walgreens&rsquo; decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students for Life and other pro-life groups have also written to Walgreens and CVS, threatening &ldquo;legal ramifications&rdquo; for the pharmacies if they begin filling prescriptions for abortion pills, Politico reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states Walgreens included in the announcement were those that made it illegal to dispense the abortion pill through mail such as Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.</span></p>]]></description>
