   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Thursday, April 27th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-pentagon-leaks-paint-gloomy-picture-of-long-war-that-cant-be-won-but-must-not-be-lost-203698"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-pentagon-leaks-paint-gloomy-picture-of-long-war-that-cant-be-won-but-must-not-be-lost-203698</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ukraine war: Pentagon leaks paint gloomy picture of long war that can&rsquo;t be won but must not be lost</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classified Pentagon documents leaked last week paint a grim picture of the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. While it may well be the most significant national security breach since the Snowden leaks of US National Security Agency material a decade ago, the fact that the leak occurred is almost certainly more significant than what was revealed about Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leak reveals how apparently easy it was for a low-level employee on a US military base to obtain and then share highly sensitive US government information. By comparison, the contents of the documents on Ukraine leaked are far less explosive in nature &ndash; they mostly confirm existing battlefield assessments that cast doubt, in the eyes of US intelligence officials, on any major breakthroughs in a widely expected Ukrainian spring offensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key shortfalls on the Ukrainian side &ndash; artillery pieces and munitions, as well as air defences &ndash; have been well known for some time. What has also been obvious for some time, and was reconfirmed in some of the leaked documents, is that Ukraine has been mostly relying on Soviet-era artillery equipment and stocks of ammunition have begun to run dry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, western equipment has been slow to be delivered and training of Ukrainian forces has taken time. And the western capacity to produce shells in excess of current Ukrainian consumption has yet to be built.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add to that delays in training and equipping the troops needed for a counter-offensive and the likelihood of well-entrenched Russian defences. The low expectations of at best modest territorial gains in a Ukrainian spring offensive do not come as a surprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equally limited gains that Russia has made over the past several months of its offensive, including around the still contested city of Bakhmut should serve as an indication of what is and is not possible after more than a year of war. Similarly, the protracted battle over Soledar back in January this year already gave a glimpse at how costly even minimal and strategically insignificant gains in this war have become.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flipside of the US assessment that any Ukrainian counter-offensive is unlikely to constitute a turning point in the war is that the fighting is likely to continue beyond this year. In some estimates it could last well beyond that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no signs that either side is willing to give up. US estimates of casualties &ndash; among the leaks from the Pentagon &ndash; indicate more than 40,000 Russian soldiers killed in action over the past year and an additional 180,000 wounded. On the Ukrainian side, the figures are lower &ndash; with 17,500 likely dead and 113,500 wounded troops &ndash; but still significant. Both countries now have tightened conscription rules and procedures in another sign that they are readying themselves for intensifying battles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally important from a Ukrainian perspective is continuing support from its western partners. Despite the logistical difficulties of ramping up defence industry outputs and deliveries to Ukraine, there is no indication that supplies will fall critically short and expose Ukraine to the risk of major battlefield defeats. This is partly because Moscow also cannot muster the superior military capabilities that would be needed for inflicting such defeats on Kyiv.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, both sides are likely to match each other&rsquo;s increases in capability over time and the current stalemate will continue, albeit at a higher level of mutual attrition. And each increase in capability, however slight, will boost the conviction that this war remains winnable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon leaks have cast doubt on such assumptions, but also confirmed that neither Washington nor Kyiv are contemplating losing the war on the battlefield or the negotiation table. Time will tell whether this is a sustainable objective &ndash; and at what cost.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/disney-sues-desantis-alleged-campaign-weaponize-government-power-against-company"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/disney-sues-desantis-alleged-campaign-weaponize-government-power-against-company</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disney sues DeSantis over alleged 'campaign to weaponize government power' against company</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney has filed a lawsuit against Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and members of the new Central Florida Tourism Oversight District alleging government power has been weaponized against them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, the company alleges a "relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint unpopular with certain State officials."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney argues the state and DeSantis have violated its First Amendment right to speech by working to strip control of the special taxing district encompassing the Walt Disney World Resort from the company after Disney spoke out against Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit was filed shortly after the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District unanimously approved a resolution to declare an agreement designed to undercut the new board's power as void. Disney cites the action as the "latest strike" in the state's string of "retaliatory" and "unconstitutional" actions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit also argues the state violated the contract clause in the U.S. Constitution by working to void an agreement Disney made with the previous board, which undercut the power of the new DeSantis-appointed district board. Lawyers for Disney also say the state violated the takings clause in the U.S. Constitution by allegedly taking property rights from the company "without payment of just compensation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fifth cause of action Disney makes in the lawsuit accuses the state of violating the due process clause of the 14th Amendment by arbitrating "the Contracts without any rational basis and for only impermissible reasons."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board had cited violations of necessary procedures outlined in the state's sunshine laws as reason to declare the agreement as void.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney is seeking to have the two laws restructuring the former Reedy Creek Improvement District declared as "unlawful and unenforceable," along with legally upholding the agreement between Disney and the former district made on Feb. 8, which stripped the new district of most of its power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entertainment giant had maintained full autonomy over the district since its creation in 1967, but legislation signed into law in February gave the state power over the district.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/nebraska-becomes-27th-state-pass-constitutional-carry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/nebraska-becomes-27th-state-pass-constitutional-carry</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Nebraska becomes 27th state to pass constitutional carry</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed constitutional carry into law on Tuesday, making it the 27th state to add to the constitutional carry majority.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law allows law-abiding Nebraskans who are 21 and up to be able to carry a concealed handgun without a permit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will go into effect 90 days after the end of the legislative session, which is scheduled for June 9.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill is backed by the NRA.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Today, Nebraska joined 26 other states whose constituents and leaders recognize that law-abiding Americans should not have to ask for special government permission and pay additional fees in order to exercise their rights outside of the home,"&nbsp; Randy Kozuch, executive director of the NRA's legislative lobby arm told Fox News in a statement.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Satanic Church Founder Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison for Operating Unlicensed Money-Transmitting Business</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-described satanist Aria DiMezzo, 35, was also ordered to pay a fine of $5,000 and to forfeit more than $14,000 along with 1.93 bitcoins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to investigators, between June 2020 and January 2021, DiMezzo charged a fee to exchange mostly U.S. dollars for Bitcoin, recruiting customers on websites.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers sent DiMezzo money through bank accounts to the Reformed Satanic Church.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DiMezzo sold more than $3 million worth of virtual currency but did not register the operation as a money-transmitting business, failing to comply with mandatory regulations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to investigators, DiMezzo failed to file currency transaction reports for exchanges of over $10,000 or suspicious activity reports for transactions over $2,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors said DiMezzo worked with a man named Ian Freeman to sell virtual currency to customers, paying Freeman a percentage of the profits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freeman was found guilty of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, laundering over $10 million in proceeds of romance scams, and tax evasion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Republicans in one New Hampshire county nominated DiMezzo for sheriff, whose campaign slogan disparaged the police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, DiMezzo said, as law enforcement, any of his deputies &ldquo;would be fired on the spot, and perhaps charged with crimes, for any brutality or misconduct.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DiMezzo serves as the high priest and founder of the Reformed Satanic Church.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The church doesn&rsquo;t believe Satan exists, DiMezzo claimed, but instead &ldquo;stands for individualism and voluntarism, and opposes the god of the day,&rdquo; which he described as the state.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/let-s-go-lawsuit-students-sue-after-school-forces-them-to-remove-let-s-go-brandon-sweatshirts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/let-s-go-lawsuit-students-sue-after-school-forces-them-to-remove-let-s-go-brandon-sweatshirts</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>'Let's go, lawsuit':&nbsp; Students sue after school forces them to remove 'Let's Go Brandon' sweatshirts</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two students are suing a Michigan school district for viewpoint discrimination after school employees forbade them wearing sweatshirts opposing President Biden, the students' legal team announced in a statement Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"These students should not only be allowed to express their political beliefs, but should be encouraged to do so," FIRE attorney Harrison Rosenthal said in the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"America&rsquo;s students must be free to exercise their constitutional rights, not just learn about them."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case stems from multiple incidents in February 2022 and May 2022 at Tri County Middle School in Howard City, Michigan. School employees ordered two students to "remove 'Let's Go Brandon' sweatshirts despite allowing students to wear apparel with other political and social messages," the complaint alleges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIRE attorneys representing the students say the incidents are "part of a pattern of political favoritism by the school district." They add that during a field day, an administrator ordered a student to stop wearing a Trump flag as a cape, but permitted students to wear gay pride flags in the same manner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the phrase originated as a means for mimicking a "f*** Joe Biden" chant, the phrase "let's go Brandon" contains no profane language. Therefore, FIRE attorneys reason, the school's dress code barring profane clothing does not apply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howard City is in west central Michigan about 35 miles from Grand Rapids. It has a population of approximately 1,967.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/city-of-chicago-forced-to-rehire-pay-lost-wages-to-workers-fired-for-refusing-covid-vaccine-mandate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/city-of-chicago-forced-to-rehire-pay-lost-wages-to-workers-fired-for-refusing-covid-vaccine-mandate</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>City of Chicago forced to rehire, pay lost wages to workers fired for refusing COVID vaccine mandate</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A Chicago judge recently ordered the city to rehire and pay lost wages to workers who were fired for refusing to comply with Democratic Mayor Lori Lightfoot's 2021 COVID vaccination mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On April 19, administrative law Judge Anna Hamburg-Gal ruled that Chicago violated the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act by failing and refusing to bargain in good faith over COVID vaccine requirements for city workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The city was ordered to "make whole" unionized workers who refused the mandate and lost pay and benefits. The affected employees will also receive 7% annual interest on lost wages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The order applies to city workers, including carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, machinists, and operating engineers, represented by trade unions or by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The judge's ruling does not affect police officers. However, the Fraternal Order of Police has its own pending case before the state board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Lightfoot stated in 2022 that 16 police officers were placed on no-pay status after failing to abide by the vaccine mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In response to the judge's recent ruling, AFSCME spokesperson Anders Lindall told the Chicago Sun-Times, "We think it's a strong decision and favorable for worker rights generally."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A Chicago Federation of Labor spokesperson stated that the judge's order "defends the rights of workers to have a say in their workplace through collective bargaining."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Lightfoot announced in 2021 that all city employees must be fully vaccinated by October and warned that those who refused would face "consequences."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to Hamburg-Gal's ruling, "multiple" city employees were placed on non-paid leave for missing the October deadline, and some were terminated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for the mayor's office said, "The record before the Administrative Law Judge tells a completely different story. Yesterday's ruling was an erroneous decision that does not follow the law, facts nor importantly the science. We are currently reviewing the ruling and evaluating next steps."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Officials Face Growing Pressure to Release Nashville School Shooter&rsquo;s Manifesto</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Law enforcement officials are facing increasing pressure to release the manifesto of Nashville, Tennessee, school shooter Audrey Hale, with a U.S. lawmaker accusing the federal government of delaying its release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Local officials said that Hale, a female who used transgender pronouns, left behind a suicide note, journals, and other materials. However, none of that has been released to the public, and a motive hasn&rsquo;t been publicly identified in the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">MNPD &ldquo;is leading this investigation &hellip; any and all information that may or may not be released will be at the direction of MNPD,&rdquo; an FBI spokesperson told The Epoch Times on April 24.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">MNPD officials didn&rsquo;t respond by press time to a request by The Epoch Times for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) and several other Republicans have also called for the document to be released to the public.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The shooter&rsquo;s notes &ldquo;could maybe tell us a little bit about what&rsquo;s going on inside of her head,&rdquo; Burchett told the New York Post. &ldquo;I think that would answer a lot of questions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) told the paper that if the documents don&rsquo;t make it to the public, &ldquo;then we need to investigate why.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hale, 28, was a former student at The Covenant School, where she fatally shot three children and three adults on March 27.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hale was killed by police within minutes of the first call of an active shooter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Since the shooting, a range of conservative commentators have publicly called for Hale&rsquo;s manifesto to be made public and have accused the federal government of delaying its release as part of a coverup to keep the public from knowing about the dangers of transgenderism. About a week after the Nashville mass shooting, a 19-year-old male who reportedly identified as female was arrested in Colorado with detailed plans for several school shootings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Days after the shooting, Nashville Police Chief John Drake said that Hale was suffering from mental health issues and was under a doctor&rsquo;s care for an unspecified emotional disorder. Her parents didn&rsquo;t know that she had multiple weapons hidden in the house, Drake added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Metro Nashville Police Department said in a statement earlier this month that Hale&rsquo;s writings would be &ldquo;under careful review by the MNPD and the FBI&rsquo;s Behavioral Analysis Unit based in Quantico, Virginia,&rdquo; while the &ldquo;motive for Hale&rsquo;s actions has not been established and remains under investigation by the Homicide Unit in consultation with the FBI&rsquo;s Behavioral Analysis Unit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">From that statement, it isn&rsquo;t clear when&mdash;or if&mdash;Hale&rsquo;s writings will be released. But the department said that Hale &ldquo;considered the actions of other mass murderers,&rdquo; without elaborating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">FBI officials didn&rsquo;t respond by press time to a request by The Epoch Times for comment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Antifa members arrested after allegedly attacking protestors, police outside of Fort Worth &lsquo;family-friendly&rsquo; drag show</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Sunday, three members of Antifa were arrested outside of a Fort Worth, Texas family-friendly drag show after allegedly attacking protestors of the event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Samuel Fowlkes was arrested on charges of resisting arrest, search, or transport, assaulting a peace officer, evading arrest or detention, and four counts of assault causing bodily injury, according to booking documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1650261782542315520"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1650261782542315520</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:00-0:25</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">What you just heard in that audio clip, was another antifa member being arrested after they attempted to &ldquo;de-arrest&rdquo; a fellow antifa member from the back of a police cruiser.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fowlkes, who is being held on $22,500 bail, has been revealed to identify as nonbinary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meghan Grant was arrested on charges of resisting arrest, search, or transport, and interfering with public duties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Christopher Guillott was arrested on charges of assaulting a peace officer and interfering with public duties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The incident occurred outside Fort Brewery and Pizza, which held the drag brunch on Sunday. In an event description, the brewery stated, "This is the perfect event to celebrate a special occasion with your friends, family, or coworkers, or to simply indulge in a fun-filled day out with your loved ones."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The three arrested are reportedly part of the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, members of which are frequently armed at protests and riots. The group is currently advertising its CashApp account on Twitter to raise bail for the arrested members.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A CashApp spokesperson told The Post Millennial, "Customer security is our number one priority. Our team takes all security concerns seriously and will take action when appropriate."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The group claimed that the arrested members were "trying to aid an injured drag defender."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Protect Texas Kids, one of the groups protesting the event, said that Antifa members "were outside assaulting police officers and macing members of [the New Columbia Movement] who were peacefully praying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On to politics&hellip;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/biden-will-veto-mccarthys-debt-limit-package"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/biden-will-veto-mccarthys-debt-limit-package</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden will veto McCarthy's debt limit package, White House announces</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden will veto House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) debt limit bill, should it pass both chambers of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden's Office of Management and Budget released a Statement of Administration Policy Tuesday morning indicating that the administration "strongly opposes the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, which is a reckless attempt to extract extreme concessions as a condition for the United States simply paying the bills it has already incurred."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The President has been clear that he will not accept such attempts at hostage-taking. House Republicans must take default off the table and address the debt limit without demands and conditions, just as the Congress did three times during the prior Administration," the statement continued. "The bill stands in stark contrast to the President&rsquo;s vision for the economy. The President&rsquo;s Budget invests in America, lowers costs for families, grows the economy, and reduces the deficit by nearly $3 trillion by asking the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share. Therefore, if the President were presented with the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, he would veto it."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s executive producer follows him in exit from Fox</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tucker Carlson's executive producer Justin Wells is also leaving Fox News, according to Jack Posobiec.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The announcement of Carlson's leaving was made on Monday, after his last show was on Friday, April 21. Fox News Tonight will now feature rotating personalities as an interim show until a new host is named.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Carlson's departure comes just weeks after a former booker, Abby Grossberg, sued Fox, citing "vile sexist stereotypes" working for Carlson. Grossberg claims that she was fired after filing a lawsuit that claimed Fox lawyers coerced her into giving misleading testimony in the Dominion case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox maintains that she was fired for divulging privileged information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The decision to part ways with Carlson came less than a week after the broadcaster and Dominion Voting Systems reached a $787 million settlement, although his show was not a main focus of Dominion's lawsuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Carlson's show was frequently the top-rated show on cable news, often surpassing 4.5 million viewers per episode.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The show premiered in November 2016 and took over the coveted 8 pm EST time slot in 2017. Fox News Media is currently the number one network in all of cable and reaches nearly 200 million people each month.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Tucker Carlson leaves Fox News as they 'agree to part ways'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways, according to a statement released on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement reads: "Mr. Carlson&rsquo;s last program was Friday April 21st. Fox News Tonight will air live at 8 PM/ET starting this evening as an interim show helmed by rotating FOX News personalities until a new host is named.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlson's show was frequently the top-rated show on cable news, often surpassing 4.5 million viewers per episode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show premiered in November 2016, and took over the coveted 8 pm EST time slot in 2017.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to part ways with Carlson comes less than a week after the broadcaster and Dominion Voting Systems reached a $787 million settlement. Carlson's show was not a main focus of Dominion's lawsuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlson's departure comes weeks after a former booker at the show, Abby Grossberg, sued Fox, citing "vile sexist stereotypes" working for Carlson. NBC reports that "Grossberg was fired in March after she filed a lawsuit claiming that Fox lawyers coerced her into giving misleading testimony in the Dominion case and that she was being made a scapegoat for the network&rsquo;s 2020 election coverage. Fox says she was fired for divulging privileged information."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grossberg's lawyer has since said that his client has a "uniquely strong" case against Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several former Fox News hosts reacted to the news of Carlson leaving the network, including Megyn Kelly, who said "Good for Tucker. Trust me, he doesn't need them."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Bongino, who also split ways with the network last week, simply tweeted "WTF!" in response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media shakeup continued&hellip;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Don Lemon TERMINATED by CNN</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Don Lemon revealed to his Twitter followers that he has been terminated by CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I was informed this morning by my agent that I have been terminated by CNN," Lemon&rsquo;s statement began. "I am stunned. After 17 years at CNN I would have thought that someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Lemon&rsquo;s statement, CNN said, "Don Lemon&rsquo;s statement about this morning&rsquo;s events is inaccurate. He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, Lemon was in hot water over comments made about Nikki Haley, being forced to undergo formal training and absent from CNN This Morning for several days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Late February, Lemon said of presidential candidate Nikki Haley saying politicians over the age of 75 should undergo mental competency tests - saying she Nikki Haley&nbsp; wasn&rsquo;t in her prime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemon went on to say women were in their prime "in their 20s and 30s and maybe 40s."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next week though, Lemon didn&rsquo;t return to the program until Wednesday, undergoing "formal training" as to why his comments were wrong. During this time, female CNN staffers threatened to quit if Lemon was allowed back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Lemon&rsquo;s absence from the morning show, CNN This Morning&rsquo;s ratings went up by five percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Lemon was removed from his long-held primetime slot to the morning show.</span></p>

<p><strong>NBCUniversal CEO ousted after having 'inappropriate relationship' with coworker</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO of NBCUniversal Jeff Shell has been ousted from the company after an investigation revealed that he was having an 'inappropriate relationship' with a female employee at the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell, who made $21.6 million per year, risked his high earnings by going against company policy and admitting to executives that he was having an "inappropriate relationship" with another woman at the company. NBCUniversal made the announcement that Shell had been terminated in an email sent to employees on Sunday, according to CNBC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings were revealed when an outside company was hired to investigate a complaint against Shell. Shell is currently married to Laura Fay Shell, who previously worked for the City of Los Angeles, Daily Mail reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal. I had an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret," Shell said in a statement. "I'm truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down, they are the most talented people in the business and the opportunity to work with them the last 19 years has been a privilege."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the vice president of NBCUniversal, Ron Meyer, was ousted from the company after improperly disclosing that he was ordered to pay a settlement to a woman he reportedly had a "consensual affair" with. Shell is the second executive to be ousted in recent years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of ousting lately&hellip; Now this&hellip;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Canada Suggests It Would Provide Women With the Abortion Pill If the U.S. Bans It</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian government said it "would work to provide" Americans access to the abortion pill, mifepristone, if the controversial drug gets banned in the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families Minister Karina Gould said it concerns her that U.S. laws are looking to "criminalize" women seeking access to reproductive healthcare.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the Supreme Court paused a federal judge's order to restrict access to mifepristone after the 5th Circuit Court overlooked a case to take the dangerous drug off the market after Texas Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled that it should not be allowed arguing that the FDA expedited the process to "green light elective chemical abortions on a wide scale."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Gould said that Americans would be able to get an abortion in Canada, which is typically less regulated than it is in the U.S. and available at later stages of pregnancy.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Newsom Directs National Guard To Combat San Francisco&rsquo;s Fentanyl Crisis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) directed the state National Guard and California Highway Patrol to help in the fight against fentanyl trafficking in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a new partnership, the agencies are tasked with identifying personnel and resources to assist San Francisco following a 41% spike in fentanyl overdose deaths in the first few months of this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are providing more law enforcement resources and personnel to crack down on crime linked to the fentanyl crisis, holding the poison peddlers accountable, and increasing law enforcement presence to improve public safety and public confidence in San Francisco,&rdquo; Newsom said in a statement on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsom&rsquo;s office said the collaboration, which also includes the San Francisco Police Department and and the San Francisco District Attorney&rsquo;s Office, will be focused on drug suppliers and traffickers rather than seeking to criminalize those struggling with substance abuse in a city that has recorded several hundred accidental overdose deaths annually in recent years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agreement will &ldquo;lead to the formation of a new collaborative operation between all four agencies focused on dismantling fentanyl trafficking and disrupting the supply of the deadly drug in the city by holding the operators of large-scale drug trafficking operations accountable,&rdquo; the governor&rsquo;s office said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsom paid a visit on Wednesday to San Francisco, a city he once led as mayor, and surveyed the Tenderloin neighborhood, which has been hit hard by crime and the fentanyl crisis. The trip took place a couple weeks after San Francisco Mayor London Breed requested federal assistance to arrest and prosecute drug dealers while the city contends with a short-staffed police department, according to local ABC affiliate KGO.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Newsom&rsquo;s visit to Tenderloin, activist JJ Smith pressed the governor on what he is doing to stop the fentanyl crisis, according to CBS News Bay Area. JJ Smith recalled Newsom saying he is working on the issue, a response which the activist felt was inadequate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsom, who is widely seen as a top future presidential contender for the Democrats, says he has already invested more than $1 billion to tackle the opioid and fentanyl crisis in California. His new budget request seeks another $96 million in funding to tackle the problem.</span></p>

<p><strong>Legendary Coach Criticizes NBA For Being Too Political</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legendary coach Phil Jackson was trending on the Internet Saturday due to comments he made criticizing the NBA on the podcast &ldquo;Tetragrammaton with Rick Rubin.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the April 5 podcast, the 11-time NBA champion said he stopped watching games during the 2020 NBA Bubble in Orlando because the league had become too political.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orlando games were held during the COVID-19 pandemic and came on the heels of George Floyd&rsquo;s death in police custody and subsequent protests in May.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAoJmHekKdM"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson slams league for becoming too political&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAoJmHekKdM&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson slams league for becoming too political</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Play 0:12-0:32</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson referred to social justice slogans the NBA allowed players to wear on the backs of their uniforms in 2020. The slogans included &ldquo;Black Lives Matter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Freedom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Power to the People,&rdquo; among others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson said he didn&rsquo;t see how these gestures made an impact and commented on how past athletes kept their political views to themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bill Bradley was a senator, a number of baseball players have been representatives and senators. . .But their politics stay out of the game. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson, 77, played in the NBA for twelve seasons and coached for 20. He retired from coaching in 2011.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever launched, exploded four minutes after takeoff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The spaceship exploded above the Gulf of Mexico shortly after takeoff, failing to achieve its ambitious goals, according to the New York Times. However, the explosion was only described as "A setback for Elon Musk and SpaceX, but not a fatal one."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">SpaceX described the event as a "rapid unscheduled disassembly before stage separation" on Twitter as the launch and short flight played out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">SpaceX still saw the test flight as a partial success, with some employees busting open a bottle of champagne amid cheers of &ldquo;Go Starship!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Business executive and the author of &ldquo;Woke Inc,&rdquo; Vivek Ramaswamy, who is vying for the 2024 presidential slot, appeared on &ldquo;CNN This Morning&rdquo; where he bumped heads with Lemon over whether the Civil War was fought to give blacks their constitutional rights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Lemon became angered when Ramaswamy connected the Civil War, where gun rights were extended to freed blacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ramaswamy argued the Democratic Party wishes to put black people &ldquo;back in chains&rdquo; with gun-control laws.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Man shoots girl, six, and her parents after ball rolls into his backyard</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A six-year-old girl and her parents were allegedly shot by a neighbor after a basketball that the child was playing with rolled into the attacker&rsquo;s yard, according to authorities and local media reporting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The shooting occurred on Wednesday in North Carolina when several young children were playing with a basketball which rolled into the yard of Robert Singletary, who neighbors say was new to the area and often mad at the local children, the news outlet WSOC-TV reported. It continued a recent spate of shootings across the US involving a property owner who fired at young people who approached them either by mistake or for an innocent reason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Witnesses told the station that Singletary ran out of his home upset after the ball rolled on to his yard and started firing a gun at a neighbor. William White and his six-year-old daughter Kinsley were seriously hurt during the shooting. White had his own gun and tried to shoot back at Singletary, who witnesses say unloaded an entire magazine at White and his daughter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">White was seriously injured after being shot in the back. Hilderbrand was grazed by a bullet and was back home on Wednesday after being discharged from a hospital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Singletary remained at large as of Thursday morning. Police warned local residents that he is armed and dangerous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Wednesday was not the first time Singletary was accused of acting violently. He was separately charged in December with assaulting his girlfriend with a miniature sledgehammer and keeping her in their apartment for two hours as she was bleeding, ABC News reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-environment/berkeley-ruling-threatens-gas-stove-bans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-environment/berkeley-ruling-threatens-gas-stove-bans</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Berkeley ruling threatens gas stove bans all over the country</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision to overturn Berkeley's ban on natural gas stoves could threaten dozens of similar restrictions nationwide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A three-judge panel sided with the California Restaurant Association in voting unanimously that the city's 2019 ban on gas stoves ran afoul of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which they said preempted a local gas stove ban &mdash; a ruling that now puts into doubt the scores of similar bans advanced across the nation in recent years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The appellate court decision may have "ripple effects" for gas appliance restrictions nationwide and provide a road map of sorts for industry and consumer groups looking to halt such policies, said Rob Rains, a senior vice president at the independent research firm Washington Analysis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The ruling "does provide a playbook for opponents of these policies to kind of 'storm the walls,' so to speak, and seek for them to be thrown out as well," he said in an interview.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">More than 100 U.S. cities and localities have moved to restrict gas-powered appliances, including 75 cities in California alone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Monday's ruling only technically applies to states that fall under the 9th Circuit's jurisdiction: California, Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, as well as Guam and the Mariana Islands. But it sets the stage for a challenge to regulations in other states. Even if bans are upheld by courts, any such ruling would create a split between circuits, raising the prospect of the Supreme Court weighing in for the whole country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The court's decision hinged on its reading of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which gives the Department of Energy the legal right to set conservation standards for certain building appliances, including hot water heaters, furnaces, and HVAC systems &mdash; and preempts local laws in those areas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The California Restaurant Association argued that gas-powered stoves are crucial for chefs to prepare food the way they are classically trained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In California, more than 75 cities and counties have modeled Berkeley's ordinance in crafting their own gas bans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Major cities, including San Francisco, Oakland, Los Gatos, and Sunnyvale, as well as Marin County, have adopted similar bans, either banning or restricting natural gas appliances, including gas-powered stoves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It is possible that gas stove critics may regroup and rework policies to sidestep the 9th Circuit ruling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Notably, the California Air Resources Board approved a plan last September to ban the sale of new natural gas-fired furnaces and home water heaters in the state by 2030. But it doesn't include gas stoves, though its final rules will not come up for a final vote until 2035.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Beyond the Golden State, cities in New York, Washington, Massachusetts, and Maryland have passed ambitious plans to phase out or ban natural gas appliances in new buildings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/alito-extends-administrative-stay-on-abortion-pill-case-till-friday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/alito-extends-administrative-stay-on-abortion-pill-case-till-friday</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Justice Samuel Alito extends administrative stay on major abortion pill case until Friday</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito extended an administrative stay over a lower court ruling that threatened to limit access to a common abortion pill until Friday, giving the justices more time to mull their decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The move to extend an administrative stay is procedural and comes just days after Alito froze a lower judge's decision to reverse the government's 2000 approval of the common abortion drug, muh - fuh - pri - stown.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The decision means that all of District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's April 7 ruling that threatened to revoke the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the drug will not go into effect until at least Friday at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Days after the district judge's decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit unwound some of the lower court's decision but kept in place a block on a seven-year effort by the agency to widen access to the drug.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ahead of Alito's decision, the manufacturer of the generic version of mifepristone, GenBioPro, filed a lawsuit against the FDA in Maryland federal court to maintain its ability to market the drug.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals halted some of the Texas decision while maintaining stays on more recent FDA changes that expanded access to the pill through telemedicine, mail, and retail pharmacies. With Alito's decision, no part of that appeals court ruling would go into effect until the late-Friday deadline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Alito, who is also the author of the opinion last summer that allowed states to impose laws severely restricting abortion access, is handling the matter because he is tasked to oversee requests stemming from the Louisiana-based 5th Circuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile, the Supreme Court must consider a separate district court ruling, issued less than an hour after Kacsmaryk's initial decision, that complicated the matter with a conflicting decision. Washington-based District Judge Thomas O. Rice, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, blocked the FDA from limiting the availability of mifepristone in much of the country. That ruling, also issued April 7, applies to just 17 liberal-leaning states and Washington, D.C., which filed a lawsuit in February challenging the FDA&rsquo;s regulations over the drug.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As of Wednesday, mifepristone is lawful and remains available in some form in 37 states, even some states with abortion restrictions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/save-womens-sports-bill-passes-house-zero-votes-dems-transgender-bullying"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/save-womens-sports-bill-passes-house-zero-votes-dems-transgender-bullying</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>'Save women's sports' bill passes House with zero votes from Dems, who call it transgender 'bullying'</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The House on Thursday passed legislation aimed at preventing biological males from competing as transgender athletes in girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s sports at schools across the country, after a debate in which several Democrats accused Republicans of "bullying" transgender students by calling up the bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act passed in a 219-203 vote Thursday morning &mdash; all the "yes" votes came from Republicans, and all the "no" votes came from Democrats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Republicans defended the bill as an attempt to spare women and girls from having to compete against transgender women and girls &mdash; biological males who can sometimes dominate these sports and prevent some female athletes from making the team. But several Democrats argued in debate that the GOP bill is an extension of the bullying that transgender students are already facing at school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., said the bill would make school sports "less safe for women and girls," and argued that even discussing the legislation on the House floor was doing harm to transgender students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Republicans rejected these arguments and said they are trying to protect girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s sports from being taken over by biological males. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said Democrats are ignoring the "physical advantages" that men have over women and rejected Jayapal&rsquo;s argument that the GOP is waging a "hate" campaign against transgender students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Republicans also accused Democrats of pursuing transgender rights to an illogical end that goes against the intent of Title IX, which most credit with dramatically expanding participation in women&rsquo;s sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Congress in 1972 created Title IX to protect women's sports to enable women to have an equal playing field in athletics," said Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., who sponsored the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. "In worship to their trans idols, the administration wants to flip that on its head. It is insane."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under Steube&rsquo;s bill, educational institutions that receive Title IX funding from the federal government would not be allowed to "permit a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designed for women or girls." The bill adds that the sex of an athlete is defined only by their "reproductive biology and genetics at birth."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Steube has said he introduced his bill in order to "save women&rsquo;s sports" from transgender women and girls who are denying biological women and girls spots on the team&rsquo;s roster, and sometimes dominate these sports. He said a dangerous shift in U.S. culture requires a defense from Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Speaking of women&rsquo;s sports&hellip; a win for Australia today!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/04/19/trans-female-nixed-from-competing-as-woman-in-semi-pro-basketball-league/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/04/19/trans-female-nixed-from-competing-as-woman-in-semi-pro-basketball-league/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trans &lsquo;Female&rsquo; Nixed from Competing as Woman in Semi-Pro Basketball League</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An application to become a player submitted by a man claiming to be a transgender female has been rejected by Australia&rsquo;s WNBL 1 South women&rsquo;s semi-pro basketball league, a report says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The application was submitted by a biological man calling himself Lexi Rodgers, who wanted to play for the Kilsyth Cobras in Kilsyth, Australia, a town in the western suburbs of Melbourne.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The request, though, was denied by Basketball Australia, the governing body for the sport there, Fox News reported.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Thursday, April 20th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">We start this off with some somber news coming out of Alabama.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/two-teens-charged-dadeville-alabama-mass-shooting-sweet-16-birthday-party"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/two-teens-charged-dadeville-alabama-mass-shooting-sweet-16-birthday-party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Two teens charged in Dadeville, Alabama, mass shooting at Sweet 16 birthday party</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Alabama authorities announced Wednesday that two teenagers have been arrested and charged in the Dadeville mass shooting at a Sweet 16 birthday party last weekend.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Four people were killed, and another 32 people were injured when gunfire erupted at approximately 10:34 p.m. Saturday at the Mahogany Masterpiece dance studio, located in the 200 Block of Broadnax Street in Dadeville, a sleepy town of just 3,200 people in Tallapoosa County, about 62 miles northeast of the state capital of Montgomery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Days later, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency announced Ty Reik McCullough, 17, and Travis McCullough, 16, were both formally charged with four counts of reckless murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The teens from Tuskegee were arrested by Special Agents with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency&rsquo;s (ALEA) State Bureau of Investigation (SBI).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"These individuals have been charged after a complex and thorough investigation was conducted with assistance from a multitude of law enforcement agencies," the ALEA said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At a press conference Wednesday, District Attorney Mike Segrest said the pair would be charged as adults and that prosecutors would ask a judge to hold them without bail. A bond hearing must be held by Friday under Alabama law. He said four people remain in the hospital in critical condition and that more charges would be coming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The gunfire broke out Saturday at a 16th birthday party for Alexis Dowdell, which was being held at the dance studio just off the town&rsquo;s courthouse square. Witnesses have said multiple people began shooting some time after Dowdell&rsquo;s mother paused the celebration to ask people with guns to leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The birthday girl&rsquo;s brother, Philstavious "Phil" Dowdell, reportedly died in his sister&rsquo;s arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Besides Phil Dowdell, a star wide receiver with plans to play college football at Jacksonville State this fall, those killed were fellow Dadeville High senior Shaunkivia Nicole "KeKe" Smith, 17, an athlete-turned-team manager; 2022 Opelika High School graduate Marsiah Emmanuel "Siah" Collins, 19, an aspiring singer who planned to start college this fall; and 2018 Dadeville High graduate Corbin Dahmontrey Holston, 23, another former athlete at the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Holston had gone to the party to check on a younger family member who feared trouble, Holston&rsquo;s mother Janett Heard told AL.com. Relatives told the news outlet that the shooting began shortly after Holston arrived, and that he pulled his younger relative to safety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/18/chinese-police-stations-allegedly-spying-on-nyc-la-more/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/04/18/chinese-police-stations-allegedly-spying-on-nyc-la-more/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>After FBI busts Chinese &lsquo;police station&rsquo; in NYC, six more exposed in US</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The FBI helped shut down a clandestine Chinese &ldquo;police station&rdquo; in Manhattan after the arrest of two alleged operatives earlier this week &mdash; but The Post is told that there are several more of these illegal organizations scattered across the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In addition to the Chinese police station above a noodle restaurant in Manhattan&rsquo;s Chinatown, there is another station at an undisclosed address in New York City, as well as an outpost in Los Angeles, according to a new report by Safeguard Defenders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Madrid-based human rights group initially published a report last year detailing 100 clandestine Chinese police stations around the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In addition to Los Angeles and New York, the nonprofit has found so-called &ldquo;overseas service stations&rdquo; in San Francisco and Houston as well as in cities in Nebraska and Minnesota.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">These law enforcement organizations, operated by the Chinese Communist Party, are tasked with spying on Chinese nationals around the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">UFWD is an acronym for United Front Work Department, a Chinese government agency that controls overseas ethnic and religious affairs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Often, the police stations &mdash; whose operatives allegedly spy on dissidents and others &mdash; hide behind nonprofits and community associations, according to Safeguard Defenders&rsquo; reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Chinatown, the police station was run by the America ChangLe Association NY Inc., which owns the building at 107 East Broadway where the operation was located, The Post revealed in October.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The nonprofit, which listed its charitable mission as a &ldquo;social gathering place for Fujianese people,&rdquo; paid $1.3 million in 2016 for the suite of offices that houses the Fuzhou Police Overseas Chinese Affairs bureau at the East Broadway location, filings show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Last year, the group held its annual gala dinner, featuring New York City Mayor Eric Adams as the guest of honor &mdash; an event that was not disclosed on the mayor&rsquo;s official agenda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Monday, federal agents arrested &ldquo;Harry&rdquo; Lu Jianwang, 61, of the Bronx, and Chen Jinping, 59, of Manhattan for allegedly establishing the East Broadway station, known as the Fuzhou branch of the Ministry of Public Security in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The men allegedly shut down the station last year when they became aware of a federal investigation, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the criminal complaint, Lu also helped track down dissidents who were living in the city. Chinese officials also requested that he participate in demonstrations against Falun Gong, a religious movement subject to crackdown across the globe by the Chinese Communist Party, the complaint said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Lu and Chen also tried to obstruct the DOJ&rsquo;s investigation by deleting their communications with an official of MPS after finding out about the FBI investigation, federal prosecutors said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The criminal complaint against Lu and Chen was unsealed Monday at the same time that 44 other defendants were charged, in two separate complaints in Brooklyn federal court, for various crimes related to illegally acting on behalf of China in the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Speaking of China, "PrayforChina.us is a nationwide initiative helping Christians pray more strategically for China by matching up every state (and eventually every county) with their own Chinese province (and county) to adopt for prayer!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/19/meta-started-latest-round-of-layoffs-focusing-on-technical-employees.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/19/meta-started-latest-round-of-layoffs-focusing-on-technical-employees.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Meta has started its latest round of layoffs, focusing on technical employees</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As part of Meta&rsquo;s latest round of job cuts announced in March, the company on Wednesday started laying off employees in technical roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Employees with technical backgrounds like user experience, software engineering, graphics programming and other roles announced on LinkedIn that they had been let go by the company on Wednesday morning. A Meta spokesperson confirmed to CNBC the cuts had started.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">One employee impacted by the moves told CNBC that Wednesday&rsquo;s layoffs also hit product-facing teams and that Meta plans to cut business-facing roles, such as finance, legal and HR, beginning in May. The employee, who discussed the layoffs under condition of a-nuh-ni-muh-tee&nbsp; to speak freely, said Meta suggested tech teams who weren&rsquo;t impacted by Wednesday&rsquo;s cuts may also be included in layoffs next month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">LinkedIn posts indicated that multiple people who worked as gameplay programmers were also affected by the layoffs. Gameplay engineers work on virtual and augmented reality products, according to a Meta job listing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">With ad revenue slumping last year and its stock price in free-fall, Facebook&rsquo;s parent announced its first round of layoffs in November, affecting some 11,000 workers. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg then declared 2023 the &ldquo;year of efficiency,&rdquo; and proceeded with a plan of an additional 10,000 job cuts in March, resulting in restructuring costs of between $3 billion and $5 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As Zuckerberg said at the time, the new round of April layoffs targets technical workers. He said cuts in the business groups would take place in late May.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Wall Street has applauded the downsizing. Meta shares have soared 81% this year after losing about two-thirds of their value last year. Revenue has declined for three straight quarters, and analysts are projecting another quarterly sales drop when Meta reports its first-quarter earnings next week. The company&rsquo;s previous guidance called for sales of between $26 billion and $28.5 billion, which means the streak of revenue declines could end if Meta reaches the top end of the range.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2023/04/18/bidens-border-roughly-180000-more-migrants-in-march/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2023/04/18/bidens-border-roughly-180000-more-migrants-in-march/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden&rsquo;s Border Flood: 180,000 More Migrants in March</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden&rsquo;s deputies accepted roughly 180,000 more illegal migrants in March to take jobs and homes that would otherwise go to better-paid Americans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The March inflow brings Biden&rsquo;s total southern inflow to roughly 4.3 million &mdash; or more than one migrant for every American born in 2022. That massive inflow spikes Wall Street by cutting Americans&rsquo; wages, inflating housing prices, and shifting new jobs and wealth to the coastal states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The two leading GOP candidates for 2024 &mdash; Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis &mdash; are promising to end the illegal migrant inflow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Federal data released on April 17 shows that 162,317 illegal migrants were arrested at the border in March by the border agents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden&rsquo;s deputies rejected 90,000 of the migrants under the Title 42 border barrier, which is due to expire on May 11. They allowed 104,238 migrants into the United States to take jobs while they plead for asylum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The 104,238 accepted migrants include roughly 80,000 people admitted after they were arrested along the borders, plus 26,583 people who used the agency&rsquo;s &ldquo;CBP One&rdquo; to get an appointment inside the United States for the catch-and-release process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But federal officials also allowed in another 30,000 migrants via quasi-legal loopholes cut by Biden&rsquo;s pro-migration, Cuban-born border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. These Cuban, Haitian, Venezuelan, and Nicaraguan migrants fly into the United States by aircraft and are not recorded in the border arrest data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This legal trick allows Mayorkas to claim that he is managing the border chaos created by Biden&rsquo;s welcome for migrants, despite a judge&rsquo;s order barring the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But the monthly data also excludes the so-called &ldquo;gotaways&rdquo; who sneak past the half-built wall, decommissioned sensor networks, and diminished border patrol.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This &ldquo;gotaway&rdquo; population added roughly 50,000 more job-seeking illegal migrants in March.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">These gotaways are quasi-legal because Mayorkas has announced he will not deport them unless they commit a violent crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">So the total inflow in March was about 180,000 &mdash; 104,238 let through the border, 30,000 lets in via Mayorkas&rsquo; pathway, plus 50,000 gotaways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden&rsquo;s policies have allowed entry by roughly 4.3 million illegal migrants since January 2021 &mdash; or roughly one migrant for every two births in the United States during his tenure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In their press release on the monthly numbers, GOP leaders touted the bigger number of migrants who arrived at the border, not the smaller number of migrants who were actually admitted by Mayorkas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Donor-backed GOP officials rarely mention the huge economic impact of Biden&rsquo;s migration on voters &mdash; or even on swing voters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 75 percent of the welcomed migrants in March are working-age job-seekers who need to pay their high-interest smuggling debts by working even tough jobs at low wages. That makes them attractive hires for U.S. employers who do not want to hire the roughly six million Americans who have been sidelined by age, criminal records, drugs, laziness, obesity, disability, or reluctance to take jobs for wages below what they have been paid before.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The federal government annually admits about 1 million temporary workers &mdash; many of whom never go home &mdash; plus about 1 million legal immigrants. Those numbers were largely set by Congress in 1990.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">All told the combination of legal and illegal immigrants delivers roughly one migrant for every American birth each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">And now this!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis released a parody of the old Bud Light "Real Men of Genius" commercials taking aim at transgender female athletes, including Lia Thomas and CeC&eacute; Telfer among others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Instead of Bud Light, which has been involved in a massive controversy over the brand&rsquo;s partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, the ad introduces Freedom Heavy and "real men of women&rsquo;s sports."</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, April 19th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Let&rsquo;s just start with on this day in history&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On this day in history, April 19th,</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">1770 British explorer Captain James Cook first sights Australia. Writes in his log book that &ldquo;what we have as yet seen of this land appears rather low, and not very hilly, the face of the Country green and Woody, but the Sea shore is all a white Sand.&rdquo;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">1775 American Revolution begins in Lexington, Massachusetts. The "Shot Heard Round the World" takes place later that day in Concord</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Minutemen Capt John Parker orders not to fire unless fired upon</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the early hours of April 19, 1775, Capt. John Parker was alerted to mobilize the Lexington Company of the Middlesex County Brigade, Massachusetts Militia, in anticipation of a British 700-man force that was marching to Concord to capture provincial arms. By 2 a.m. Parker had mustered his company on the Lexington Green. The Lexington Company of militia was typical of the period. The youngest militiaman was 18, the oldest 63; eight fathers and sons served together. Most were farmers, while some were veterans of the French and Indian War. Just after sunrise Parker and his 77 militiamen stood in defiance of the British advance guard. "Stand your ground," Parker ordered. "Don't fire unless fired upon. But, if they want to have a war, let it begin here." Maj. John Pitcairn, commander of the British advance guard, ordered the militiamen to lay down their arms. Realizing that his company was outnumbered, Parker ordered his men to disperse. As the militiamen began to break ranks, a British officer fired his pistol. Without orders, the British troops opened fire. Although greatly outnumbered, the militiamen returned the fire. The battle went on for several minutes, all around the Green. When it was over, eight Americans lay dead and nine were wounded.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">And that, was on this day in history&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now let&rsquo;s get to current news:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/04/17/us-sails-warship-through-taiwan-strait-after-chinas-drills.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/04/17/us-sails-warship-through-taiwan-strait-after-chinas-drills.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>US Sails Warship Through Taiwan Strait After China's Drills</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The United States Navy has sailed a warship through the Taiwan Strait in its first known transit since China carried out an encirclement exercise around self-ruled Taiwan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The U.S. 7th Fleet said the transit through the strait by the USS Milius on Sunday was routine. The cruisers &ldquo;transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State,&rdquo; the statement said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Last week China concluded large-scale air and sea drills in the strait in retaliation for Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on April 5 in California. China said Wednesday that the exercises simulating an encirclement of Taiwan were intended as a &ldquo;serious warning&rdquo; to pro-independence politicians on the self-governing island and their foreign supporters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">China protested the transit Monday, saying the U.S. transit was a &ldquo;public hype&rdquo; and that the Eastern Theater Command was ready at any time to &ldquo;resolutely safeguard the country's sovereignty, safety, and regional peace and stability," according to a statement from the Eastern Theater Command's spokesperson Shi Yilu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">China has stepped up its military pressure over Taiwan in recent years, sending fighter jets and navy vessels towards the island on a near-daily basis. After former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last August, China sent more and more military vessels over the midline of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary that had been accepted for decades. That increasing pressure from China has given greater attention to Taiwan globally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Taiwan's military confirmed a French navy vessel had transited the middle of the Taiwan Strait last week. However, it did not elicit a public protest by the Chinese military.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">China earlier had sanctioned the organizations involved with Tsai's visit in the U.S., including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, where her meeting with McCarthy and other members of Congress were held. It also sanctioned U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who chairs the chamber's Foreign Affairs Committee, for visiting Taiwan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Sunday, China launched a rocket carrying a satellite that dropped debris into waters north of the capital Taipei. While the satellite launch had no obvious military purpose, it disrupted travel, delaying flights.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Chauvin Murder Conviction Upheld in George Floyd Killing</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Minnesota Court of Appeals on Monday upheld former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's second-degree murder conviction in the killing of George Floyd, and let his 22 1/2-year sentence remain in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Chauvin's attorney had asked the appeals court to throw out the ex-officer's convictions for a long list of reasons, including the massive pretrial publicity. He also argued that legal and procedural errors deprived Chauvin of a fair trial. But the three-judge panel sided with prosecutors who said Chauvin got a fair trial and just sentence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Floyd died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, used his knee to pin the Black man's neck to the ground for 9 1/2 minutes. A bystander video captured Floyd's fading cries of "I can't breathe." Floyd's death touched off protests around the world, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who assembled the prosecution team, said in a statement that he was "grateful we have a system where everyone, no matter how egregious their offense, is entitled to due process and fair treatment."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The Court's decision today shows once again no one is above the law &mdash; and no one is beneath it," Ellison said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A voicemail and emails were sent to Chauvin's attorney, William Mohrman. He argued on appeal that the trial judge should have moved the case out of Minneapolis because of extensive pretrial publicity and unprecedented security precautions due to fears of violence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But Neal Katyal, a special attorney for the state, argued that Chauvin got "one of the most transparent and thorough trials in our nation's history."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill sentenced Chauvin to 22 1/2 years after jurors found him guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin later pleaded guilty to a separate federal civil rights charge and was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison, which he is now serving in Arizona concurrent with his state sentence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Local defense attorney Mike Brandt, who has followed the case closely, said he was not surprised that the appeals court affirmed Chauvin's conviction and found no errors that would have changed the outcome. Appellate courts give judges wide discretion and are loath to micromanage how they run trials, he said. He added that Cahill created a solid record to justify the decisions he made in a "high-pressure case where literally the eyes of the world were on him."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The appeals court declined to address whether it was legally permissible to convict Chauvin of third-degree murder. The defense said a 2021 Minnesota Supreme Court decision in a different police killing case that clarified the definition of that crime meant the law no longer fit the facts of Floyd's killing. But the appeals court noted that the trial judge never formally adjudicated that conviction nor did he sentence Chauvin on that count.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/fox-dominion-settle-us-defamation-lawsuit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/fox-dominion-settle-us-defamation-lawsuit</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fox and Dominion settle for $787.5m in defamation lawsuit over election lies</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox and the voting equipment company Dominion reached a $787.5m settlement in a closely watched defamation lawsuit, ending a dispute over whether the network and its parent company knowingly broadcast false and outlandish allegations that Dominion was involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The settlement came before scheduled opening statements and after an unexpected lengthy delay Tuesday afternoon just after the jury was sworn in. Neither party immediately disclosed the terms of the settlement other than the dollar amount, and attorneys for Dominion declined to answer questions about whether it requires Fox to issue a retraction or a formal apology.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Opening statements were scheduled to start on Tuesday after a lunch break, but the judge and jurors did not return to the room until close to 4pm. During the more than two-hour delay, attorneys huddled and left the courtroom to convene in adjacent meeting rooms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After returning to the courtroom, Davis thanked the jurors for their service, and called the efforts by the lawyers on both sides &ldquo;the best lawyering I&rsquo;ve had, ever&rdquo; in his career on the bench since 2010.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The anticipated six-week jury trial was originally set to begin on Monday, but Davis, the judge overseeing the case, postponed the start of trial by a day as the sides worked to reach a settlement agreement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The trial in Wilmington, Delaware, was set to be a blockbuster media trial. Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old chief executive of Fox, was called to testify in the case, along with top Fox talent including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Dominion, a relatively obscure company until the 2020 election, sought $1.6bn in damages in the case. It challenged repeated claims made on Fox&rsquo;s air after the general election that Dominion switched votes, paid government kickbacks, and was founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Ch&aacute;vez.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the press conference Tuesday, Dominion CEO John Poulos called the settlement historic because of Fox&rsquo;s admission that it was telling lies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2023/04/17/the-climate-fanatics-have-a-new-food-target-n2622039"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2023/04/17/the-climate-fanatics-have-a-new-food-target-n2622039</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>The Climate Lunatics Have a New Food Target</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Climate change lunatics who want to ban beef and force everyone to eat bugs have a new target.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to AFP news, climate "scientists" are targeting rice farming as a "dangerous," emissions heavy practice. They say flooded rice fields, which then naturally ferment hay and other plants, produce too much methane.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to National Geographic, rice is a main and key food source for 3.5 billion people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Rice is a food staple for more than 3.5 billion people around the world, particularly in Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa. Rice has been cultivated in Asia for thousands of years. Scientists believe people first domesticated rice in India or Southeast Asia. Rice arrived in Japan in about 3,000 years ago. The Portuguese most likely introduced it into South America in the 16th century," the magazine reports. "Today, the world&rsquo;s largest rice producers are China, India, and Indonesia. Outside of Asia, Brazil is the largest rice producer. Rice grows in warm, wet climates. It thrives in waterlogged soil, such as in the flood plains of Asian rivers like the Ganges and the Mekong. "Deepwater rice" is a variety of rice that is adapted to deep flooding, and is grown in eastern Pakistan, Vietnam, and Burma."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile, Sri Lanka recently adopted a number of climate change policies on reducing fertilizer and caused a major food crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"In April 2021, then-president announced an abrupt ban on the import of chemical fertilisers to force the country of 22mn to embrace organic farming. The prohibition lasted only about six months, but analysts said the ill-fated policy not only stoked an economic crisis, it would leave Sri Lanka&rsquo;s agricultural sector hobbled for years," the Financial Times reports. "Over the past 18 months, the country has become a cautionary tale for global agriculture. Vital inputs such as fuel and fertilisers are in short supply, with prices soaring. Yields from rice and other staples have halved in many areas and the once largely self-sufficient Indian Ocean island now depends on international aid to combat a hunger crisis."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">There's no doubt a new climate attack on rice will have a catastrophic impact.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>As Biden hides, House will vote on one-year debt limit hike</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Speaker Kevin McCarthy vowed Monday that while President Biden &ldquo;continues to hide, House Republicans will take action&rdquo; on a plan meant to limit federal borrowing to one year and reduce government spending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Let me be clear: A no-strings-attached debt limit increase will not pass,&rdquo; McCarthy (R-Calif.), 58, said in a speech at the New York Stock Exchange meant to evoke former President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s visit to the trading floor nearly 40 years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Monday&rsquo;s remarks sought to highlight what McCarthy called Biden&rsquo;s &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; economic policy after the speaker last month accused the commander-in-chief of being &ldquo;missing in action&rdquo; from debt ceiling talks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The speaker in March suggested cutting non-defense spending back to pre-inflationary levels and introducing more work requirements for some welfare programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden rolled out a $6.9 trillion budget proposal the same month, which would have increased the national debt to $51 trillion over the next decade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In January, the federal government exceeded its roughly $31 trillion debt limit, halting its ability to borrow funds for programs like Social Security and Medicare. Congress last approved a debt ceiling increase in December 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also in January, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the federal borrowing limit will need to be increased by June of this year to prevent a default on America&rsquo;s national debt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">McCarthy said Biden&rsquo;s unwillingness to negotiate as commander-in-chief differs greatly from his past openness to fiscal reform as a US senator and even as Barack Obama&rsquo;s vice president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both the White House and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) compared McCarthy&rsquo;s push for spending cuts to &ldquo;hostage-taking.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>2 Arrested for Allegedly Operating Illegal Chinese &lsquo;Police Station' in NYC</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Two people have been arrested by the FBI on allegations they helped operate an illegal police station for the government of China in lower Manhattan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The two are charged with conspiring to act as agents for the Chinese government. The FBI said &ldquo;Harry&rdquo; Lu Jianwang, 61, of the Bronx, and Chen Jinping, 59, of Manhattan, were arrested Monday morning at their homes in New York City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The defendants worked together to establish the first overseas police station in the United States on behalf of the Fuzhou branch of the (Ministry of Public Security)," the FBI said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In addition to the New York complaint, two other complaints were filed - one against 34 members of Beijing's Municipal Public Security Bureau, and another against a group of 10 people that includes eight Chinese government officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The common thread in the three complaints - that the suspects allegedly worked to intimidate, harass and threaten "wanted" Chinese nationals inside the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Last November, the FBI said it was aware that China was operating a de facto police station in Manhattan, outside of proper procedure or authority, as part of global network of such outposts. It followed a Sept. 2022 investigation by a nongovernmental organization, Safeguard Defenders, which reported there were dozens of such centers worldwide conducting police operations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Chinese officials decried that characterization, saying the "service centers" were volunteer-run and had nothing to do with policing. But the New York Times reported in January that Chinese state media had explicitly described the centers as policing facilities, acting in other countries without collaborating with local authorities. The Times also reported that the FBI had searched the East Broadway facility in the fall of 2022.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Pelosi campaign pays Illinois man $7,500 after he sued over 'invasive and harassing' fundraising texts</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An Illinois man is now $7,500 richer after accusing Nancy Pelosi of violating federal robocalling laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In October 2022, a Bolingbrook, Illinois resident named Jorge Rojas filed a 13-page lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that accused the former speaker of the House and her campaign of violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That law, which has been found to apply to text messages in addition to calls, applies restrictions to robocalling and requires telemarketers not to contact individuals who've placed themselves on the Do Not Call Registry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"As the Supreme Court has explained, Americans passionately disagree about many things," reads the introduction of Rojas's complaint. "But they are largely united in their disdain for robocalls."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the suit, Rojas received 21 texts from Pelosi's campaign from November 2021 to July 2022 despite previously placing himself on the registry in 2008 to "obtain solitude from invasive and harassing telemarketing calls."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He went on to argue that he "experienced frustration, annoyance, irritation, and a sense that his privacy has been invaded" by the texts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Arguing that the texts constituted "malicious, intentional, willful, reckless, wanton and negligent disregard" for his rights, Rojas sought at least $31,500 in damages from Pelosi's campaign, including $1,500 for each text received.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But months later, on February 22, Rojas moved to dismiss the suit against Pelosi.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">And according to federal campaign finance disclosures made public on Friday, the dismissal came after Rojas received a $7,500 payment marked "Settlement" from Pelosi's congressional campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Rojas and Pelosi's campaign did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>&lsquo;Teen Takeover&rsquo; terrorizes Chicago as hundreds of teenagers destroy property, attack tourists</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hundreds of teenagers stormed the streets of downtown Chicago, smashing car windows, attacking bystanders and sending panicked tourists running from the sound of gunfire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox 32 cameras captured video of teenagers crowding the streets and police seeking to restore order to the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Large groups of teens were seen blasting music from Bluetooth speakers and roaming in front of traffic, with some attempting to gain access to the city's Millennium Park, which is off-limits to those under 21 after certain hours, and the downtown Art Institute.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Some teens in the group began jumping up and down on cars, smashing windows and attacking people inside. One woman told Fox 32 her husband was attacked from the driver side of his vehicle and beaten after a group of teens jumped up and down on the couple's windshield. The man was taken to a local hospital for treatment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hundreds of police officers assisted by SWAT teams descended on downtown in an attempt to restore order as gunfire was reported multiple times amid the unfolding scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police were seen escorting frightened tourists back to their cars or hotels to escape the chaos, and traffic on Chicago's Michigan Avenue ground to a halt as police attempted to restore order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in the arm near the Chicago Loop and a 17-year-old boy was shot in the leg. Both were taken to Northwestern Hospital and listed in fair condition, according to a report from WLS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox 32 reported that the chaos appeared to be another "Teen Takeover" of the city that was planned on social media, noting that a similar scene played out in Chicago last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Some local reporters were on the scene to interview some by-standers, including a woman who&rsquo;s husband was beaten in their car.&nbsp;</span></p>
