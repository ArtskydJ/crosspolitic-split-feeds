<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Redballoon</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so long ago, the American dream was alive and well. Employees who worked hard were rewarded, and employers looked for people who could do the job, not for people who had the right political views.&nbsp; RedBalloon.work is a job site designed to get us back to what made American businesses successful: free speech, hard work, and having fun.&nbsp; If you are a free speech employer who wants to hire employees who focus on their work and not identity politics, then post a job on RedBalloon.&nbsp; If you are an employee who is being censored at work or is being forced to comply with the current zeitgeist, post your resume on RedBalloon and look for a new job. redballoon.work, the job site where free speech is still alive!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-environment/how-farmers-angry-about-green-rules-helped-spur-dutch-governments-collapse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-environment/how-farmers-angry-about-green-rules-helped-spur-dutch-governments-collapse</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How farmers angry about green rules helped spur Dutch government's collapse</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nitrogen emissions reduction targets have divided the Dutch population, ushering in an upstart political party and playing a primary role in the ouster of Prime Minister Mark Rutte just days after the shocking collapse of his coalition government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rutte, the longest-serving Dutch prime minister and a sharp tactician who has presided over four different governing coalitions, does not appear to have an immediate successor lined up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rutte&rsquo;s looming vacancy and the waning popularity of his People's Party for Freedom and Democracy could also clear the way for him to be replaced by someone on the far Right, as growing controversies over migration, farming, and nitrogen emissions reduction targets continue to sow deep divisions among voters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dutch government agreed last summer to comply with the European Union&rsquo;s nitrate directive, a mandate that requires the country to slash 50% of its nitrogen emissions by 2030 &mdash; and which it plans to do primarily by reducing nitrogen-heavy fertilizer deposits on its many livestock farms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That agreement touched off a massive protest by tens of thousands of Dutch farmers, who massed in the streets to protest the decision, which they decried as unrealistic and unfair, given the country's status as a farming and agriculture powerhouse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 40,000 people took part in the demonstrations, gathering outside government buildings, setting fire to bales of hay, and using their many tractors to block Dutch highways, canals, and warehouses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protests all but forced the country&rsquo;s economy to a standstill &mdash; and may have also played a role in reshaping the country's political tide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just months after the summer protests, the Farmers Citizens Movement, a populist, pro-farmer party known by its Dutch acronym of BBB, swept to power in the country&rsquo;s provincial elections, ultimately gaining enough seats in parliament to put it on par with the left-of-center Labor Party and the Green Party in the Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders of BBB, a party formed only three years earlier, made a name for themselves largely by appealing to the anger of farmers and others who work in the Dutch agriculture sector and campaigned on the promise of fighting the EU&rsquo;s mandated nitrogen emissions targets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week's news of Rutte&rsquo;s departure, coupled with the rise of BBB, is widely expected to exacerbate existing deep-seated divisions over the future of agriculture and farming in the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also makes it far less likely that the splintered parties will be able to strike a compromise on key politically fraught issues, including nitrate emissions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near term, the Dutch government will effectively be held at a standstill, since Rutte will remain in his position through November to oversee a so-called &ldquo;caretaker&rdquo; government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading a caretaker government means that Rutte and the holdover group of officials are unable to approve new and important policy decisions until a new government is formed later this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then, action will be suspended for months on key issues &mdash; including the country's ability to pass important policies on migration or climate, including taking further action on the EU&rsquo;s nitrate directive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, the European Commission approved the Dutch government&rsquo;s plan to buy out some of its most heavily polluting farms at roughly 120% of their value. The plan, estimated to cost around $1.65 billion, was aimed at helping the government deliver on its nitrogen emissions reduction commitments without sparking the deep unrest seen last summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In announcing the effort, it warned the buyouts could become compulsory if farmers do not comply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There is no better offer coming,&rdquo; Dutch Nitrogen Minister Christianne van der Wal told members of parliament.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Netherlands is the EU&rsquo;s largest emitter of nitrogen oxide and ammonia and was ordered by the European Court of Justice in 2018 to address the problem. It also has a nitrogen balance nearly twice the European average &mdash; the majority of which comes from farming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if it hopes to deliver on its 50% nitrogen reduction target by 2030, the Dutch government must act quickly &mdash; it has estimated that to meet its goal, 11,200 farms in the country will have to close. Roughly 17,600 others will have to significantly reduce their livestock numbers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that has not gone over smoothly in the Netherlands, a farming and agriculture powerhouse where disagreements over nitrogen pollution reductions have sparked bitter protest and disagreement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its size of just 16,158 square miles &mdash; an area only slightly larger than the state of Maryland &mdash; the Netherlands is home to more than 110 million livestock and 54,000 agricultural businesses. It is the most intensively farmed country in all of Europe, and the world&rsquo;s second-largest exporter of agricultural goods, behind only the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farm and agriculture groups in the Netherlands have slammed the Dutch government&rsquo;s plans as &ldquo;unrealistic," according to the farming group LTO, and argued that the country's farmers have been unfairly targeted compared to other industries, which they argue remain comparably unscathed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others point to the massive amount of revenue generated by agriculture exports, which totaled roughly 105 billion euros in 2021 alone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is not going to work," LTO Netherland Chairman Sjaak van der Tak, whose organization represents 35,000 farmers, said in response to the government targets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others fear these divisions in the Netherlands could portend a larger trend in Europe and the Western world as environmental targets grow more ambitious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-secret-service-says-no-suspect-in-white-house-cocaine-scandal?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-secret-service-says-no-suspect-in-white-house-cocaine-scandal?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Secret Service says 'no suspect' in White House cocaine scandal</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secret Service has reportedly concluded its investigation into the bag of cocaine that was discovered in the White House. But no suspect has been identified, according to two sources, per CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secret Service looked through visitor logs and surveillance footage of those who came into the West Wing in the days leading up to the discovery, but they came up short.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators weren't even able to identify a specific moment or day when the baggie was left inside the White House. One source said the prevailing theory is that the baggie was left behind by one of the hundreds of visitors who entered the West Wing for tours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cubbies where the small bag of cocaine was apparently found were in a blind spot for surveillance cameras, per the report. This has made it difficult to pin down who may have been responsible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representative Tim Burchett posted a video on Twitter about the investigation: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1679502198374277120"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1679502198374277120</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A so-called powdery substance was discovered at the beginning of July, and speculation has since swirled as to who it may have belonged to. By July 5, officials had confirmed that the powdery substance was, in fact, cocaine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Politico, an unidentified source familiar with the case said that it's "gonna be very difficult for us to do that because of where it was," noting that the baggie was discovered in a blind spot that wasn't picked up by the surveillance cameras.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the substance was discovered in the heavily trafficked West Wing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden family was not at the White House when the substance was discovered on Sunday. Joe, Jill, and Hunter had dashed to Camp David on the previous Friday, and they returned to the White House on Tuesday for Independence Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1676673509819404301"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1676673509819404301</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there has been speculation as to whether the cocaine belonged to Hunter Biden, who has openly spoke about his drug problems. Hunter was reportedly at the White House in the days before the cocaine was discovered. But there has been no evidence to directly connect the baggie of cocaine to the president's son.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean-Pierre had previously been asked whether the Biden administration would seek out prosecution if the culprit was found, but she evaded the question by saying she was "not going to get into hypotheticals."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NBA approves rule change to make flopping a technical foul</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look out [insert your least favorite NBA player here], flopping is about to come at a real cost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NBA Board of Governors approved a rule change that will make flopping a technical foul for the 2023-24 season, the league announced Tuesday, the result of increasing frustrations from fans and teams toward players who go out of their way to sell contact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change will come on a one-year trial basis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, when a game official calls a flop, defined by the NBA as "a physical act that reasonably appears to be intended to cause the officials to call a foul on another player," the offending player will be charged with a non-unsportsmanlike technical foul and give the other team one free-throw attempt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the nature of the technical foul, a player will not be ejected from a game due to flopping violations. Refs will also not have to interrupt play to call a flop, as they can wait until the next stoppage to hit a player with the penalty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NBA specifically notes it's possible for the officials to call both a foul and a flop on the same play.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The league also instituted a change that will give coaches a second challenge if their first challenge is successful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flopping was previously punished with a warning, then fines escalating from $5,000 to $30,000. Such punishments were rare. The fines will change now that flopping is a tech, as it will be rolled into the existing fines for technical fouls instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NBA was already trying out this system in the Summer League. Lester Quinones of the Golden State Warriors was the first player to feel the effect, getting called for a flop during a break in play.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start things off in China!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/10/chinese-military-kindergarteners-war-bootcamps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/10/chinese-military-kindergarteners-war-bootcamps/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Chinese Military Is Training Kindergarteners For War In Bootcamps Across The Country</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese military is training kindergarteners to handle firearms and fight like soldiers in boot camps across China this summer, according to dozens of school social media accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boot camps feature combat training for boys and girls with a wide variety of toy weapons including knives, grenades, rifles and shoulder-fired missiles, and require the children to adopt military behavior, such as saluting, the schools&rsquo; social media posts show. The rise in the militarization of China&rsquo;s youth appears to follow a 2019 Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee push for increased &ldquo;National Defense Education&rdquo; and a related effort directing schools to hold National Defense Education activities in 2022, according to government documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniformed People&rsquo;s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers oversaw all of the kindergarten boot camps. The boot camps were located in major Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Nanjing and Shenzhen, and were also run in more than half a dozen provinces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programs featured roughly the same sequence of activities, according to a DCNF review of posts from the participating kindergartens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boot camps generally began with basic military etiquette and proceeded to teach various military skills ranging from combat to emergency medical training. Additionally, a number of these programs also taught the children about famous PLA heroes and martyrs, according to the schools&rsquo; accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2023, faculty members and more than 80 children of numerous provinces assembled on the playground for the opening ceremony of their school&rsquo;s week-long National Defense Education camp, all wearing matching camouflage fatigues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;INHERIT THE RED GENE, CARRY FORWARD PATRIOTIC FEELINGS, LOVE CHINA, LITTLE SOLDIER,&rdquo; declared a large PLA banner, which partially hid the kindergarten&rsquo;s playset.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniformed PLA soldiers then performed a flag-raising ceremony, with all attendants singing the Chinese national anthem, the social media post stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We solemnly swear to love the motherland from now on, to dedicate our hearts to working together to build the dream of a powerful country,&rdquo; the children then pledged, according to the social media post. &ldquo;Even if I fall to the ground I will continue onward!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLA soldiers then taught the kindergarten recruits how to groom themselves and make their beds in accordance with military standards, before drilling them in how to stand at attention, stand at ease and salute.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts say recent efforts to militarize China&rsquo;s youth are part of the CCP&rsquo;s ideological goals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now compare that to the U.S., where students are regularly pushed into ideologies that despise everything the Founding Father&rsquo;s did.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Just unfathomable": Disney World is "just about empty" during summer vacation season</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes real skill to drive this many customers away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The July 4th weekend was a 10-year-low for the massive company's Disney World amusement park in Orlando, but all the parks have been suffering recently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Wall Street Journal, Park visitors in recent weeks have had significantly lower wait times to get on rides, according to data from Touring Plans, a company that tracks wait times at major amusement parks, including Disney World and Disneyland in California. Industry analysts say shorter wait times generally correlate with smaller crowds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average posted wait time at the Magic Kingdom park in Florida &mdash; which has a special fireworks display on July 4 &mdash; was 27 minutes this year for the holiday, down from 31 minutes in 2022 and 47 minutes in 2019, the Touring Plans analysis shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's something that nobody would have predicted &mdash; just unfathomable," says Len Testa, a computer scientist who runs Touring Plans. Testa says wait times rose in the following days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journal offers an assortment of potential reasons for the lull: Cruises and European vacations are back after the pandemic, Disney isn't offering much new, and Disney wants to slim down the crowds for richer guests anyway.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A record share of Americans is living alone</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 30 percent of American households comprise a single person, a record high.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholars say living alone is not a trend so much as a transformation: Across much of the world, large numbers of people are living alone for the first time in recorded history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a stunning social change,&rdquo; said Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University and author of the book &ldquo;Going Solo.&rdquo; &ldquo;I came to see it as the biggest demographic change in the last century that we failed to recognize and take seriously.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homo sapiens is a social animal. Historians tapped ancient census rolls to show that our species has lived in groups for as long as such records have existed, stretching back at least to 1600.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Census shows that &ldquo;solitaries&rdquo; made up 8 percent of all households in 1940. The share of solo households doubled to 18 percent in 1970 and more than tripled, to an estimated 29 percent, by 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solo-living movement intersects with several other societal trends. Americans are marrying later, if at all. The nation is aging. The national birthrate is falling. People are living longer &mdash; or they were, until the pandemic arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than anything, perhaps, the rise of single-person households is about women entering the workforce and achieving economic self-sufficiency. The share of adult women participating in the labor force reached 50 percent around 1980.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically speaking, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t really see people living alone until women have control of their own lives and their own bodies,&rdquo; Klinenberg said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers see a marked downside to living alone, especially for older Americans, for people who live outside thickly settled cities and for pretty much anyone who is not alone by choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A New York Times report on aging solitaries concluded that, &ldquo;while many people in their 50s and 60s thrive living solo, research is unequivocal that people aging alone experience worse physical and mental health outcomes and shorter life spans.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nation&rsquo;s declining birth rate and aging population portend a time when America doesn&rsquo;t have enough working-age citizens to sustain the national economy or to support the spiraling health care needs of its oldest citizens. The rise of single-person households can be seen as both a cause and effect of those challenges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s something we should be worried about,&rdquo; said Wendy Wang, director of research at the Institute for Family Studies, a conservative thinktank. &ldquo;If we have fewer and fewer children, that means we have fewer people to work, to be consumers, to pay taxes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang notes that low fertility rates are a global problem. Indeed, solo households are far more common across much of Europe than in the United States. According to United Nations data, solitaries make up 39 percent of households in Denmark, 45 percent in Finland, 42 percent in Germany, 38 percent in the Netherlands, 39 percent in Norway and 40 percent in Sweden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, living alone is not quite so common in the United States as the data suggest. While nearly 30 percent of households comprise a single person, far fewer than 30 percent of Americans live in them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 13 percent of American adults live alone, research shows. Breaking down that figure by age groups, the population of solitaries rises from 4 percent of adults at ages 18-24 to 9 percent at 25-34, dips to 8 percent at 35-44, then rises again, to 12 percent at 45-54, 17 percent at 55-64 and 26 percent at 65 and up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living alone is much more common in large cities. Singles now make up more than 40 percent of households in Atlanta, Seattle, San Francisco, Minneapolis and Denver, according to a paper by the British historian Keith Snell. Half of all Manhattan dwellings are one-person residences. Snell identified a Midtown Census tract where 94 percent of households comprised a single person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At younger ages, men outnumber women in one-person households. Young men are far more likely than young women to be single, and they tend to marry later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gender gap in solitary living closes with age. In the retirement years, women are more likely than men to live alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That statistic is partly about women outliving husbands, and partly about &ldquo;grey divorce,&rdquo; the rising rate of marriages that dissolve after age 50. The grey divorce rate has doubled since 1990.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It used to be that if people were married for 30 years and they entered their 60s, basically, they were going to stay married,&rdquo; said Barbara Risman, a distinguished professor of sociology at the University of Illinois Chicago. &ldquo;You would pass the risk of divorce. No one is ever past the risk of divorce anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through much of the 20th century, marriage was so universal that the very act of living alone carried a stigma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The share of Americans who had not married by age 40 hovered below 10 percent from 1950 through 1980, according to a Pew Research analysis. The figure has soared in recent decades, reaching 25 percent in 2021, a record high.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The share of Americans in prime marriage years who are actually married has dwindled from about two-thirds to around half since 1990, Pew data show. Nearly two-fifths of Americans are &ldquo;unpartnered,&rdquo; neither married nor cohabiting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers consider living alone a risk factor for loneliness and social isolation, conditions associated with a host of physical and mental maladies, from heart disease to obesity to anxiety and depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men tend to fare less well than women in single-person households, said Louise Hawkley, a researcher at the NORC thinktank who studies loneliness and social isolation. - Perhaps because we&rsquo;re meant to be taking dominion &amp; building families&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>US soccer star Megan Rapinoe would support trans athlete on USWNT roster: 'I see trans women as real women'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. women&rsquo;s soccer icon Megan Rapinoe has been a public advocate for the inclusion of transgender athletes in women&rsquo;s sports, and ahead of what will be her final World Cup appearance before retiring, the one-time Golden Boot winner said she would "absolutely" support having a trans woman on the USWNT roster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if that meant replacing a biological female.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with Time published Monday, Rapinoe recalled highlights from her lengthy career, including her battles both on and off the pitch. She was asked specifically about her push to defend transgender athletes&rsquo; participation in women&rsquo;s sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We as a country are trying to legislate away people&rsquo;s full humanity," she told the outlet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe was one of 40 professional athletes to co-sign a letter to House lawmakers in April in opposition of the Protection of Girls and Women in Sports Act, arguing that the bill would exclude women and girls from getting "mental and physical health benefits."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s particularly frustrating when women&rsquo;s sports is weaponized," Rapinoe said in the interview. "Oh, now we care about fairness? Now we care about women&rsquo;s sports? That&rsquo;s total bulls---. And show me all the trans people who are nefariously taking advantage of being trans in sports. It&rsquo;s just not happening."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe was asked specifically if she would support a trans woman playing on the United States Women&rsquo;s National Team, even if it meant replacing a biological female. The OL Reign star said she would, but added that she did not view the act as "taking a &lsquo;real&rsquo; woman&rsquo;s place."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Absolutely," she told Time. "&lsquo;You&rsquo;re taking a &lsquo;real&rsquo; woman&rsquo;s place,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the part of the argument that&rsquo;s still extremely transphobic. I see trans women as real women. What you&rsquo;re saying automatically in the argument&mdash;you&rsquo;re sort of telling on yourself already&mdash;is you don&rsquo;t believe these people are women. Therefore, they&rsquo;re taking the other spot. I don&rsquo;t feel that way."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe will make her final World Cup appearance this month as the United States Women&rsquo;s National Team heads to Australia and New Zealand with the hopes of making history: becoming the first women&rsquo;s or men&rsquo;s team to win a three-peat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 38-year-old soccer star announced over the weekend her plans to retire at the conclusion of the 2023 National Women&rsquo;s Soccer League season.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee's ban on transgender surgery for kids goes into effect immediately, federal appeals court rules</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee can implement its ban on transgender surgery and related medical interventions for minors as a case challenging the law works its way through the court, a divided federal appeals court panel ruled Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee's 44th House District Representative William Lamberth (R) wrote on Twitter Saturday: "I am thankful to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals for confirming what Tennesseans already know: Children cannot give consent to experimental medical procedures or drugs that destroy their healthy bodies,"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennessee law now in effect, at least temporarily, prohibits surgical procedures and administration of hormones or puberty blockers for the purpose of gender transition, as Reason explains.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Thapar joined Sutton, concluding that the lower court had wrongly stopped the law's implementation. Judge White delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ban, originally set to take effect July 1, will now take effect immediately. The ban was held up when a lower court sided with the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee. ACLU-TN argued that the law interfered with parental rights and was unconstitutional, as The Hill reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first federal court to allow such a ban, with other courts unanimously blocking similar bans in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Indiana, and Kentucky, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU-TN brought the suit on behalf of Samantha and Brian Williams of Nashville and their 15-year-old daughter, as well as two other anonymous families and Dr. Susan N. Lac.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>City To Distribute Foil, Straws, Snorting Kits To Drug Addicts</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health officials in Portland, Oregon announced last week they will begin handing out tin foil, straws and snorting kits to drug addicts throughout the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its &ldquo;Harm Reduction Program,&rdquo; the Multnomah County Health Department announced Friday that drug paraphernalia will be offered to those using fentanyl and other hard drugs, KOIN 6 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of fentanyl has decreased the need for needle-focused &ldquo;harm reduction&rdquo; services, Department spokeswoman Sarah Dean told the Willamette Week. Since fentanyl is smoked rather than injected, clinic visits have dropped 60% since 2019, Dean said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is backed by Multnomah County&rsquo;s Public Health Director, Jessica Guernsey, who says, &ldquo;The new part of the program is that we&rsquo;re adding supplies for people who smoke drugs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others are not happy with the move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This misguided approach also results in greater risk to public safety for those who simply want to enjoy our city without walking through a cloud of toxic smoke,&rdquo; Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said. &ldquo;Our community would benefit more from the County using its funding to urgently increase treatment and sobering facilities rather than actively enabling this deadly epidemic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean countered the mayor&rsquo;s statement by claiming providing drug paraphernalia does not increase drug use but encourages addicts to visit clinics where they can get access to fentanyl test strips and the overdose antidote, Narcan, KOIN 6 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Oregon Legislative Assembly recently passed a bill decriminalizing the distribution of &ldquo;drug paraphernalia&rdquo; for harm reduction purposes, according to the Willamette Week. Similar programs have been launched in Washington and California. In New York City, vending machines with smoking kits and bubble pipes have recently been installed, the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Oregon bill to decriminalize distribution of drug paraphernalia sits on Governor Tina Kotek&rsquo;s desk awaiting signature before going into law, the New York Post reported.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/07/09/the-winner-of-miss-netherlands-2023-is-a-man-n563401"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/07/09/the-winner-of-miss-netherlands-2023-is-a-man-n563401</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The winner of Miss Netherlands 2023 is a man</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender activism marches on. The newly crowned Miss Universe Netherlands is a man. The runner-up is a woman.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rikkie Valerie Koll&eacute; was crowned Miss Universe Netherlands 2023 on Saturday. Rikkie is 22 years old, a Dutch-Moluccan model and actress in Leusden. He will represent the Netherlands at the 2023 Miss Universe pageant in El Salvador. The first runner-up is Nathalie Mogbelzada, 26, from Amsterdam.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reigning Miss Universe, R&rsquo;Bonney Gabriel of Houston, Texas, was a special guest at the pageant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He makes history as the first transgender woman to win the national title. In 2018, Angele Ponce, Miss Universe Spain, was the first transgender to participate in the Miss Universe pageant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of having a transgender competitor in the Miss Universe pageant goes back to 2012. That is when Trump owned it and he overturned a decision by the Miss Universe organization to disqualify a Canadian model. Jenna Talackova was not being allowed to compete because &ldquo;she was not a naturally born female.&rdquo; Trump bowed to the laws of Canada and allowed Jenna to compete. The LGBTQ community applauded Trump. Now he&rsquo;s running against a very socially conservative Republican, Ron DeSantis, among others, and Trump has flipped on the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Miss America pageant is also having its share of problems. Ever since former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson came out as super woke and joined the organization, internal battles have leaked into the press. One big issue is that when Carlson joined the organization in 2018, she made the decision to ban the swimsuit segment. Now a former Miss America, Caressa Cameron, says that the pageant feels like a Ted Talk. There is a new docuseries on A&amp;E that exposes scandals, misogyny, and racism in the Miss America competitions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in world news:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-centcom-says-killed-isis-leader-syria-airstrike-no-civilian-casualties"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-centcom-says-killed-isis-leader-syria-airstrike-no-civilian-casualties</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>US CENTCOM says it killed ISIS leader in Syria airstrike, no civilian casualties</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. forces killed ISIS leader Usamah al-Muhajir in an airstrike in eastern Syria on Friday, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) announced in a Sunday statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al-Muhajir was killed by the same MQ-9 reaper drones that had been harassed by Russian aircraft in the region. The two incidents occurred the same day, the U.S. says, with the drones carrying out the strike after the interaction with Russian craft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have made it clear that we remain committed to the defeat of ISIS throughout the region," said CENTCOM commander Gen. Michael Kurilla. "ISIS remains a threat, not only to the region but well beyond."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CENTCOM clarified that there were no indications that any civilians were killed in the strike, but the U.S. and allies were assessing reports of a civilian injury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and allied forces in the region have carried out a consistent campaign against remaining ISIS leaders operating in Syria. The U.S. killed the head of the organization, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a 2019 raid. Since then, ISIS forces have operated as cells.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MQ-9 drones used in the attack had earlier interactions with Russian SU-35 fighter jets throughout last week. The Russian craft have repeatedly flown into the path of the drones, forcing them to take evasive action to avoid a collision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Russian military aircraft engaged in unsafe and unprofessional behavior Thursday, 9:30 a.m. local time, while interacting with U.S. MQ-9 drones carrying out our D-ISIS mission in Syria," said Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, commander, 9th AF and CFACC for CENTCOM. "Russian aircraft dropped flares in front of the drones and flew dangerously close, endangering the safety of all aircraft involved."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is the second instance of dangerous behaviors by Russian pilots within the past 24 hours, with the first happening Wednesday at approximately 10:40 a.m. local time," he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military has also urged Russian forces in Syria to "cease this reckless behavior and adhere to the standards of behavior expected of a professional air force, so we can resume our focus on the enduring defeat of ISIS," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. maintains a force of about 900 troops deployed in Syria. They primarily work with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in their struggle against Islamic State militants.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/cnn-discourages-viewers-from-watching-anti-pedophile-movie-sound-of-freedom?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/cnn-discourages-viewers-from-watching-anti-pedophile-movie-sound-of-freedom?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CNN discourages viewers from watching anti-pedophile movie, Sound of Freedom</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a clip from CNN, network host Abby Phillip brought on an author named Mike Rothschild to talk about the new and popular anti-child sex trafficking film, Sound of Freedom. Rothschild charged the film is created out of a "moral panic" and "QAnon concepts."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound of Freedom is based on the adventures of Tim Ballard, who started an organization known as Operation Underground Railroad (OUR). OUR's mission is to save children from human trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rothschild wrote a book titled, "The Storm is Upon Us," which details many QAnon conspiracy theories such as the idea that the Democratic Party elites are part of a cabal of Satanic worshippers that drink the blood of children.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rothschild targeted said the film is "being marketed to either specific QAnon believers or to people who believe all of the same tenets as QAnon, but claim they don't know what it is."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN has had its own problems with employees being involved in child sex crimes. One former producer at the network, John Griffin, was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Griffin coerced a woman online to bring her nine-year-old daughter to Vermont to engage in illicit acts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story depicted in the film is of Ballard, played by Caviezel, rescuing children. After much strife with working in the US government, he bumps up against bureaucracy in his position as an agent. He had to quit his job to rescue the kids in the film and did so in reality as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the beginning of OUR as a non-government organization. The movie focuses on Ballard's mission to save the two children and reunite a family torn apart by child sex trafficking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the movie, Caviezel appears on screen with a special message to share and urges people to "pay it forward" and donate to allow others to see the film.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caviezel says, "Steve Jobs once said, 'The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller.' Abraham Lincoln credited Harriet Stowe when she wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin. This powerful story inspired millions to rise up and fight against slavery. I think we can make Sound of Freedom the Uncle Tom's Cabin of modern-day slavery."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Sound of Freedom is a hero's tale, but I'm not talking about the character I play. It's the heroic brother and sister in this film that work to save each other."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caviezel added, "Together, we have a chance to make these two kids, and the countless children that they represent, the most powerful people in the world by telling their story in a way only the cinema can do."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we wrap up today&rsquo;s show, let&rsquo;s talk about on this day in history!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this day in history, July 11th:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">138 Antoninus Pius succeeds Hadrian as Emperor of Rome</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1405 Chinese fleet commander Zheng He sets sail on his first major expedition, to the Spice Islands, leading 208 vessels, including 62 treasure ships with 27,800 sailors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1533 Pope Clement VII excommunicates England's King Henry VIII</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 11th July 1533, the Pope declared that Henry VIII&rsquo;s marriage to Anne Boleyn was null and void, as was the annulment declared by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in May 1533, and he restored Catherine of Aragon to her &ldquo;royal state&rdquo;. He ordered the wayward king to abandon the newly crowned and pregnant Anne Boleyn and return to Catherine of Aragon. If the king refused then the Pope would issue the bull of excommunication that he had drawn up. He&rsquo;d give Henry until September to sort himself out, but if he didn&rsquo;t heed the Pope&rsquo;s warning then he&rsquo;d be excommunicated, the most severe punishment that the Church could inflict.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Henry took absolutely no notice of the Pope, but he escaped excommunication until 17th December 1538 when Pope Paul III excommunicated him following his break with Rome, his persecution of those who did not accept his supremacy, the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry&rsquo;s desecration of religious shrines including that of Thomas Becket.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the age of 30, the remarkable Thomas Hutchins (1730?-1789) was an experienced frontiersman, a veteran of the French and Indian War, and a skilled Indian agent. He was best known, however, as a formidable surveyor, cartographer, and geographer. A native of New Jersey, the particular combination of skills made Hutchins the perfect candidate for surveying the vast western regions of the British North American empire. In 1766, he was officially assigned to duty as an engineer in the British army, gradually becoming the most respected surveyor and map maker in the colonies. From 1764 through 1768, he took part in expeditions spanning the west from the northern reaches of the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans, and in 1770, was transferred from the Illinois territory to Pensacola, where he was charged with reorganizing the provincial defenses and mapping.</span></li>
