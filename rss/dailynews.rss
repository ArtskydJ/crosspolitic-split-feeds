<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Media in Panic Mode Over Questions About Whether They Knew in Advance About Hamas Attack on Israel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 7, four photojournalists who provide reporting and photos for the likes of the Associated Press (AP), CNN, the New York Times, Reuters, and other outlets were allegedly at the Israeli border with Hamas terrorists who committed acts of atrocities against innocent Israeli civilians that shocked the world. Since an Israel-supporting news watchdog website reported the claim, everyone wants to know if these Gaza-based reporters knew in advance about the attack and, more importantly, if they could have saved lives by alerting the world about it. The question arises: Did the AP, CNN, the New York Times, and Reuters know about the Hamas terror attack in advance?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegations have sent major media into panic mode and generated even more mistrust in the corporate press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website HonestReporting, which chronicles coverage of Israel by an increasingly one-sided press to contrast the "Pallywood" and crisis actor coverage by Hamas and its agents, asks: "Is it conceivable to assume that 'journalists' just happened to appear early in the morning at the border without prior coordination with the terrorists? Or were they part of the plan?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamas terrorists paraglided and drove into the civilian populations that day and committed acts of horrific brutality. They wanted their murders and acts of terror chronicled for the world, which is why they wore GoPro cameras and apparently arranged for these traditional media photographers to go in with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HonestReporting reported that "four names appear on AP&rsquo;s photo credits from the Israel-Gaza border area on October 7: Hassan Eslaiah, Yousef Masoud, Ali Mahmud, and Hatem Ali." The news watchdog took a close look at Elsaiah, a "freelancer who also works for CNN, crossed into Israel, took photos of a burning Israeli tank, and then captured infiltrators entering Kibbutz Kfar Azza."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsaiah "did not wear a press vest or a helmet," the website reported. He posted a video of himself on Twitter/X saying that &ldquo;everyone who were inside this tank were kidnapped, everyone who were inside the tank were kidnapped a short while ago by al-Qassam Brigades [Hamas&rsquo; armed wing], as we have seen with our own eyes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website later featured an older photo of Elsaiah with the Hamas leader who planned the attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In war reporting, journalists are often given a heads-up and allowed to chronicle American troops heading into battle, for example. But this wasn't an act of war -- it was terror. It was murder for murder's sake. There hadn't been an Israeli offensive to which the Gaza terror organization was responding. Indeed, if Hamas had been wearing uniforms and acting as an "army" they would be accused of war crimes. As it is, they're accused of crimes against humanity.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UK infant Indi Gregory dies amid legal battle with British government over treatment options</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A terminally ill baby in the United Kingdom, who was the focus of a legal battle involving her parents, British health officials and the Italian government over treatment options, died Monday morning in hospice care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Concern, a group supporting the family, said 8-month-old Indi Gregory died after her life support was withdrawn on Sunday, according to The Associated Press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infant had suffered brain damage because of a rare condition known as mitochondrial disease.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The child's doctors said her life support should be removed to allow her to die at a hospital or in hospice, but her parents, Dean Gregory and Claire Staniforth, continued to fight for her to remain on life support, hoping that experimental treatments may extend her life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Italian government had solicited permission for her to be treated at Bambino Gesu Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Rome. Italian officials even granted citizenship to the baby amid the legal battle over her health care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors claimed that Indi was not aware of her surroundings and was suffering as they argued she should be allowed to die peacefully. Legal challenges supported by Christian Concern were rejected by British judges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indi's case is the latest in a series of legal battles in the United Kingdom between parents and doctors over treatment for children with terminal illnesses. British judges have repeatedly taken the side of doctors in cases about the best interests of the child, despite parental objections to a proposed treatment option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court of Appeal Justice Peter Jackson said on Friday that doctors treating Gregory and other critically ill children were put in an "extremely challenging" position by the legal battle. He also criticized "manipulative litigation tactics" that attempt to frustrate orders made by judges after careful consideration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/over-70-of-americans-unwilling-to-be-drafted-if-ww3-breaks-out-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/over-70-of-americans-unwilling-to-be-drafted-if-ww3-breaks-out-poll/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Over 70% of Americans Unwilling to Be Drafted If WW3 Breaks Out, Poll</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new poll has found that 72 percent of Americans would be unwilling to volunteer to serve their country if WW3 breaks out, compared to just 21 percent who said they would.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the US becomes deeply embedded in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war, the Echelon Insights findings suggest most Americans hold a more &lsquo;America First&rsquo; view of foreign policy than the political establishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1987, the US military has shrunk by 39 percent, and the Army and Air Force missed their recruitment targets in 2023 by 10,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Navy missed its target by 6,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of troops could pose a big problem for America&rsquo;s war readiness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While infantry soldiers are relatively easy to train in a crisis, pilots and naval specialists require years of instruction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The National Pulse noted, the traditionally conservative-leaning young people the military has often relied on for manpower may also have been deterred by its intolerant attitude towards unvaccinated Americans in recent years and senior officers&rsquo; promotion of far-left interests such as drag and &ldquo;white rage.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, with the prospect of WW3 is becoming more likely, Americans may not have to worry about being drafted as nuclear weapons would destroy most countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, President Donald Trump warned that Mexico could be at risk of nuclear destruction in the Event of WW3 breaking out from the war in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said the potential ramifications of another nuclear war could involve the total destruction of Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The biggest threat is nuclear weapons,&rdquo; Trump said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/12/former-national-champion-texas-head-coach-jimbo-fischer-fired-poor-performance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/12/former-national-champion-texas-head-coach-jimbo-fischer-fired-poor-performance/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Former National Champion Head Coach Jimbo Fischer Fired For Poor Performance</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas A&amp;M has fired head football coach Jimbo Fischer, bringing his six-year tenure with the Aggies to a close while netting himself $76 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firing comes on the heels of a 51-10 victory of Mississippi State, moving Texas A&amp;M to 6-4 on the season, according to CBS Sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher took the Texas A&amp;M head coaching position in 2018, coming off a successful tenure at Florida State, where he won a national championship in 2014, per the outlet. While the Aggies did manage to go 9-4 in 2018, Texas A&amp;M has struggled over the past two seasons, barely cracking eight wins in 2021 and going 5-7 in 2022, per the outlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Fischer became head coach of the Aggies, he signed a 10-year, $75-million contract, which was later extended through 2031. The contract also came with a massive buyout clause worth $76 million, which he is now owed by Texas A&amp;M, per the outlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;After very careful analysis of all the components related to Texas A&amp;M football, I recommended to President Welsh and then Chancellor Sharp that a change in the leadership of the program was necessary in order for Aggie football to reach our full potential and they accepted my decision. We appreciate Coach Fisher&rsquo;s time here at Texas A&amp;M and we wish him the best in his future endeavors,&rdquo; Texas A&amp;M athletics director Ross Bjork said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aggies will finish off their regular season with Abilene Christian University and top-25 LSU.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2023/11/07/bloomberg-u-s-debt-interest-bill-soars-past-1-trillion-a-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2023/11/07/bloomberg-u-s-debt-interest-bill-soars-past-1-trillion-a-year/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bloomberg: U.S. Debt Interest Bill Soars Past $1 Trillion a Year</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of high levels of debt and higher interest rates has pushed the annualized interest cost of government debt past $1 trillion, an analysis from Bloomberg showed Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This amounts to a doubling of interest costs over the past 19 months, according to Bloomberg. It is the equivalent of 15.9 percent of the Federal budget for fiscal year 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The worsening metrics may reignite debate about the US fiscal path amid heavy borrowing from Washington. That dynamic has already helped drive up bond yields, threatened the return of the so-called bond vigilantes and led Fitch Ratings to downgrade US government debt in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There will be further increases to Treasury coupon auctions and T-bills outstanding going forward,&rdquo; Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Ira Jersey and Will Hoffman wrote in a research note. &ldquo;Besides deficits of over $2 trillion in the foreseeable future, climbing maturities following the increase of issuance from March 2020 will also need to be refinanced.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cumulative deficit for the 2024&ndash;2033 period will total $20.2 trillion, or 6.1 percent of GDP. Deficits are expected to be at least 5.5 percent of GDP every year for the coming decade. Since 1973, the federal government budget deficit has averaged 3.6 percent of GDP.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/07/van-jones-biden-retire-2024-election-drop-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/07/van-jones-biden-retire-2024-election-drop-out/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Time&rsquo;: CNN&rsquo;s Van Jones Says Biden Needs To Consider Retiring</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN&rsquo;s Van Jones said Tuesday that President Joe Biden needs to consider retiring following a poll from The New York Times/Siena College.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sunday poll found president Donald Trump leading Biden by a substantial margin in five out of six key swing states. Biden holds a slight edge within the margin of error over Trump in Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones argued Biden is in a tough position. </span><strong>Video Plays</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several pundits have questioned whether Biden should drop out of the race, with CNN&rsquo;s David Axelrod saying the president needs to decide whether staying in the race is &ldquo;in his best interest or the country&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of Defending Democracy Together Bill Kristol posted on X that Biden needs to make an act of &ldquo;personal sacrifice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time. President Biden has served our country well. I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll do so for the next year. But it&rsquo;s time for an act of personal sacrifice and public spirit. It&rsquo;s time to pass the torch to the next generation. It&rsquo;s time for Biden to announce he won&rsquo;t run in 2024,&rdquo; Kristol wrote.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/11/07/future-darwin-award-winner-tried-to-target-jewish-children-in-americas-midwest-n590580"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/11/07/future-darwin-award-winner-tried-to-target-jewish-children-in-americas-midwest-n590580</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future Darwin Award Winner Tried to Target Jewish Children in America's Midwest</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman in Indiana plowed her car into a building she thought was a Jewish school. The police describe her as a terrorist and she was arrested at the scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only was her intention to hurt or kill Jewish school children in their school in Indianapolis but she was completely mistaken about her target. The 34-year-old terrorist woman, allegedly backed her vehicle into a building associated with Black Hebrew Israelites on Friday. She admitted to the police that she specifically targeted the building because she was offended by a Hebrew Israelite symbol in front. This psycho thought she was entitled to try to harm children because she was offended by a symbol in front of the building, apparently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were several adults and children in the building at the time. However, they were not who the woman thought they were. She said, &ldquo;Yes. I did it on purpose.&rdquo; She kept describing the building as the &ldquo;Israel school&rdquo; and she spoke about &ldquo;her people back in Palestine.&rdquo; According to the Anti-Defamation League, the Israelite School of Universal and Practical Knowledge is a sect of the Black Hebrew Israelites. It is an extremist group that is anti-Israel. The Southern Poverty Law Center (I know) has designated them as a hate group. So, ironically, the unhinged and offended the woman plowed into the building used by a group who hate Israel as she does.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is Darwin Award material. An investigation is underway. There may be additional charges brought against her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis said Safe Indiana, a Jewish community security program, is working with cops to probe the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Safety and security for our community is of the utmost importance, and we are more secure and prepared than ever before,&rdquo; the federation said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Although a Jewish facility was not targeted, solely due to ironic misidentification, this is yet another reminder to maintain security protocols, remain vigilant of suspicious activity and to (report promptly) to the appropriate authorities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These random acts of terror seem to be increasing. FBI Director Christopher Wray recently warned of lone wolf attacks. Wray said Hamas inspired terrorists pose a threat not seen since the days of ISIS. She confessed that she was motivated to do the attack after watching news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. She is originally from Amman, Jordan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wray said that while Hamas is assessed to have no capabilities inside the US, other actors &ndash; possible radicalized individuals or small groups &ndash; could take inspiration from the terror group in a way similar to ISIS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to the Senate&rsquo;s Homeland Security Committee, he said: &ldquo;We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration, the likes of which we haven&rsquo;t seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said: &ldquo;Here in the United States, our most immediate concern is that violent extremists &ndash; individuals or small groups &ndash; will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was charged with a preliminary charge of criminal recklessness. Her first court appearance is scheduled for today, November 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255928/vatican-hospital-offers-to-treat-critically-ill-baby-denied-life-support-in-britain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255928/vatican-hospital-offers-to-treat-critically-ill-baby-denied-life-support-in-britain</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vatican hospital offers to treat critically ill baby denied life support in Britain</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vatican&rsquo;s pediatric hospital has offered to treat 8-month-old baby Indi Gregory after a British court ruled that she be removed from life support against her parents&rsquo; wishes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregory, who was born in February, suffers from a rare degenerative mitochondrial disease and has been receiving life-sustaining treatment on a ventilator at the Queen&rsquo;s Medical Centre in Nottingham, England.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After England&rsquo;s high court ruled that it was in the child&rsquo;s &ldquo;best interests&rdquo; to be taken off life support, Gregory&rsquo;s parents appealed to take her to Rome for treatment, an appeal that was denied by a British judge over the weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Italian government decided in an emergency meeting on Monday to grant the critically ill child Italian citizenship and to cover the cost of her medical treatment at the Vatican&rsquo;s Bambino Ges&ugrave; (jay-zoo) hospital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;They say there isn&rsquo;t much hope for little Indi, but until the very end, I&rsquo;ll do what I can to defend her life,&rdquo; Italian President Giorgia Meloni wrote on social media on Nov. 6. &ldquo;And to defend the right of her mamma and papa to do all that they can for her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bambino Ges&ugrave; hospital has previously offered medical treatment to other critically ill children, including Alfie Evans in 2018 and Charlie Gard in 2017, both of whom were ultimately denied the chance to travel to Italy by U.K. courts and died days after being removed from life support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Concern has published a letter from the president of the Bambino Ges&ugrave; hospital outlining &ldquo;a detailed treatment plan&rdquo; for the child, which includes &ldquo;life-sustaining treatment and palliative care to ensure Indi&rsquo;s survival and comfort while the treatments take effect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Williams, chief executive of Christian Concern and the Christian Legal Centre supporting the Gregorys&rsquo; case, has noted that this is believed to be the first time that a parent&rsquo;s appeal against an order to withdraw life-sustaining treatment has been rejected by the Court of Appeal without a hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The law is there to protect life and the most vulnerable in our society. What is happening in this case sets a very worrying precedent with regard to that principle,&rdquo; Williams said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is very concerning that a child can be held against the parents&rsquo; wishes when they have alternative treatment available.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the newly granted Italian citizenship, the child&rsquo;s parents, Dean Gregory and Claire Staniforth, can appeal to the Italian consulate in Britain to request that their daughter be airlifted to Italy for treatment, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone Pillon (pee-lone), an Italian lawyer assisting the Gregory family, wrote on Nov. 7: &ldquo;We are working to find an agreement between the two countries to satisfy the family&rsquo;s request and treat Indi in Rome.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the Italian government&rsquo;s decision, Dean Gregory, Indi&rsquo;s father, said: &ldquo;My heart fills up with joy that the Italians have given Claire and I hope and faith back in humanity. The Italians have shown us care and loving support and I wish the U.K. authorities were the same.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Marching Band turns into Marching Hands?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Southern band member punches heckler in the stands, continues playing -&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&rsquo;t miss a beat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Texas Southern University tuba player swiftly knocked out an obnoxious heckler during a football game Saturday before carrying on playing his instrument.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video taken from the stands during Saturday&rsquo;s game between Texas Southern and Jackson State shows the college band&rsquo;s tuba player bouncing along to the music while a fan starts yelling at him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Jackson State fan can be seen in the footage aggressively yelling at the tuba player, who is attempting to continue playing with the band.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeming to have had enough of the outburst, the Texas Southern tuba player says something to the man before swiftly punching him four times in the face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Texas Southern band member then returns to his instrument as if the altercation never happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one recording of the incident, the band member can be heard telling the aggressive fan, &ldquo;F&ndash;k off, b&mdash;h.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unclear whether the heckler, who stumbled back several feet in the stands, sustained any injuries from the scuffle. It&rsquo;s also unclear whether police responded to the incident or if any action was taken against the band member.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Southern University ended up losing to Jackson State, 21-19.</span></p>

<p><strong>FIELD HOCKEY CAPTAIN SLAMS MASSACHUSETTS LAW ALLOWING BOYS ON GIRLS TEAMS AFTER BRUTAL INJURY TO HER TEAMMATE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men competing against women in sports spawned another tragic story on Thursday when a female field hockey player suffered significant injuries to her face after taking a shot from a male opponent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The female high schooler played on Dighton-Rehoboth High School&rsquo;s team, and now the co-captain / teammate of her squad is speaking up and calling for policy change to prohibit men from competing against women to avoid further incidents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelsey Bain, who plays on Dighton-Rehoboth and is the co-captain of the field hockey team, posted a letter on X, directed at the MIAA to change the association&rsquo;s policy that allows men to compete against women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is a letter I sent to the MIAA in response to the recent Swampscott vs. Dighton-Rehoboth field hockey incident,&rdquo; Kelsey Bain posted on X, including the three-page notice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women&rsquo;s rights activist and OutKick host Riley Gaines shared Bain&rsquo;s statement on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man played for Swampscott High School, who played Dighton-Rehoboth in a playoff field hockey contest on Thursday. Under the MIAA&rsquo;s ruling &mdash; the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association &mdash; men can compete against women if a sport does not offer their gender&rsquo;s league.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man&rsquo;s shot knocked several of the girl&rsquo;s teeth out and caused serious facial injuries. Video of the hit shows the girl writhing in pain and screaming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent these incidents from continuing, Kelsey Bain is stepping into the discourse, understanding that the association will not budge on the issue unless they are challenged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dighton-Rehoboth Superintendent Bill Runey put out a statement, identifying that the opponent was indeed a man and relaying the horror of the team personnel after one of their own suffered a brutal injury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Runey said,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Last night, a female field hockey player for the Dighton-Rehoboth Regional High School girls&rsquo; field hockey team sustained significant facial and dental injuries when she was struck in the face by a shot in the third quarter versus Swampscott in an MIAA state playoff contest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The shot was taken by a male member of the Swampscott girls field hockey team. This injury required hospitalization. The player, her family, teammates, and coaches remain in my prayers.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Manifesto of trans Nashville school shooter LEAKED, full of anti-white hate</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leaked manifesto reveals the Nashville trans school shooter had a violent hatred of the &ldquo;little crackers&rdquo; with &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; that were murdered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First obtained and released by the Louder with Crowder conservative Rumble show, the three-page handwritten document allegedly shows Audrey &ldquo;Aiden&rdquo; Hale meticulously planned her last moments and the mass school shooting at The Covenant School on March 27. Three young children and three school staff were killed before Hale, 28, was shot dead by responding police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manifesto, written in a spiral notebook, has various creeds and thoughts scrawled down by pen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;DEATH DAY,&rdquo; Hale wrote on one page with the drawing of a target reticle and a pistol, along with the date &ldquo;3/27/23.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The day has finally come!" Hale wrote. "I can't believe its [sic] here. Don't know how I was able to get this far, but here I am. I'm a little nervous but excited too. Been excited for the past 2 weeks."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale continued: "There were several times I could have been caught especially back in the summer of 2021. None of that matters now. I am almost an hour &amp; 7 minutes away."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m doing this, but I&rsquo;m ready," Hale wrote. "I hope my victims aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale later prayed to God in the manifesto to help her in the mass shooting. "(God let my wrath take over my anxiety) It might be 10 minutes tops. It might be 3-7. It's gonna go quick," Hale wrote. "I hope I have a high death count."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale then wrote, "Ready to Die nana" and signed it "Aiden," Hale's trans name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another page, Hale wrote a detailed day schedule, with a post-it calmly asking, "Lunch may be [sic] around 11 am&ndash;1 pm?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale's day began at 6:30 a.m., and ran through getting dressed, breakfast and what to do with the "stuffed animals &amp; possessions." At 9:30, Hale was to "pack up special belongings in backpack(s)."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 10:20, Hale was to "gear up &amp; set up guns in trunk (assembly) &amp; get out vest (w/mags inside)." Hale was armed with a handgun, a rifle and a pistol modded to handle like a rifle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale also wrote about making a "final video tape" on the schedule, though this has not been released by police or confirmed to even exist. Hale detailed a plan to leave for the Covenant School by 11:35.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last entries to Hale's schedule were for 12:35, where she would "open fire," and then it was "time 2 die [sic]." Hale was shot dead by police at around 10:27.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of the pages headlined, "Kill those kids!!!,&rdquo; Hale calls the students &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; and expresses hatred for their &ldquo;white privilege.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale also wrote a bunch of more obscenities about the kids that I won&rsquo;t mention&hellip; but you get the idea.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities have been criticized for months for not releasing Hale's manifesto. A source with the Louder with Crowder show told The Post Millennial that they received the photographs of Hale's notebook from a "source near law enforcement."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hales mass shooting earlier this year preceded a planned "Trans Day of Vengeance" event in the U.S. capital that was ultimately canceled. And in the immediate hours after the shooting, trans activists occupied several state capitol buildings to protest pending legislation restricting the transitioning of children. At the capitol in Nashville, trans activists held a moment of silence for the victims of the mass shooting. They held up seven fingers to include Hale as among the victims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell, a Democrat, says his office is immediately investigating the unauthorized release of some of the images from the Nashville trans shooter&rsquo;s manifesto. Authorities have tried to prevent the release of Hale&rsquo;s writings before today&rsquo;s leak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-nashville-mayor-launches-investigation-into-leak-of-trans-nashville-shooters-manifesto?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-nashville-mayor-launches-investigation-into-leak-of-trans-nashville-shooters-manifesto?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nashville mayor launches investigation into leak of trans Nashville shooter's manifesto</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the leak of the transgender Nashville shooter&rsquo;s alleged manifesto on Monday morning, Mayor Freddie O&rsquo;Connell said that the city has launched an investigation into how the images of the writings were released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I have directed Wally Dietz, Metro&rsquo;s Law Director, to initiate an investigation into how these images could have been released. That investigation may involve local, state, and federal authorities. I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving," O&rsquo;Connell said in a statement, according to WSMV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This incident naturally invokes additional emotional trauma, and families or individuals who need support should reach out to professionals at National Alliance on Mental Illness (615-891-4724), MNPD support counselors (615-862-7773) or MNPS Family Information Center (615-259-INFO)."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday morning, Steven Crowder released three handwritten pages of what he said were Audrey Hale&rsquo;s manifesto. These highlighted an anti-white sentiment held by the shooter that killed three young students and three staff members of the Covenant School on March 27, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pages apparently show Hale planning the day of the shooting down to the minute, including in all capital letters at the top of the page, "DEATH DAY." A source with the Louder with Crowder show told The Post Millennial that they received the photographs of Hale's notebook from a "source near law enforcement."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trump demands jury, says New York AG has 'no case' in heated testimony</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump demanded a jury Monday after his unprecedented time on the stand, calling the civil trial against him and his businesses a "disgrace" and saying New York Attorney General Letitia James has "no case."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump described his forced testimony as "election interference" while maintaining that his net worth is "far greater" than financial statements during testimony Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The President and 2024 Republican presidential front-runner took the stand Monday morning in the non-jury civil trial stemming from James&rsquo; lawsuit against him, his family and his businesses. James alleged Trump defrauded banks and inflated the value of his assets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly said his assets were actually undervalued. Trump has repeatedly said his financial statements had disclaimers, requesting that the numbers be evaluated by the banks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I think this case is a disgrace," he said, adding that people are being "murdered" in New York as James is "watching this case."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s a disgrace. It is election interference because you want to keep me in court all day long," Trump said while on the stand after testifying for more than five hours. "And Judge &hellip; I want a jury."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Trump's attorneys, at the end of the President's testimony, said that in "33 years," they have "never had a witness testify better."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"An absolutely brilliant performance by President Trump. He's not backing down. He's told everyone the facts," the Trump attorney said. "Now that the American people know what's going on, maybe something will change."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James, a Democrat, sued Trump, his children and the Trump Organization last year, alleging that he and his company misled banks and others about the value of his assets. James said the President&rsquo;s children &ndash; Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric &ndash; and his associates and businesses committed "numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation" on their financial statements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James filed the lawsuit against Trump "under a consumer protection statute that denies the right to a jury," a Trump spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There was never an option to choose a jury trial," the spokesperson said. "It is unfortunate that a jury won&rsquo;t be able to hear how absurd the merits of this case are and conclude no wrongdoing ever happened."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Trump&rsquo;s unprecedented testimony Monday, New York Judge Arthur Engoron tried to cut him off from providing lengthy answers to state lawyers&rsquo; questioning, and he even said, "I don&rsquo;t want to hear everything he has to say."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Trump defended himself and his businesses while on the stand and blasted the investigation, lawsuit and non-jury trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We shouldn&rsquo;t be having a case here because we have a disclaimer clause that every court holds up except this judge," Trump said, referring to the disclaimers on all of his financial statements and statements of financial condition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump went on to call James a "political hack," saying she used her investigation and lawsuit against him "to become governor, to become attorney general." The President was referring to James&rsquo; campaigns in which she vowed to "get Trump."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engoron, in September, ruled that Trump and the Trump Organization committed fraud while building his real estate empire by deceiving banks, insurers and others by overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He ruled against me without knowing anything about me," Trump said on the stand. "He called me a fraud, and he didn&rsquo;t know anything about me."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump went on to slam Engoron for undercutting the value of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida &mdash; a property that Engoron valued at $18 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's testimony concluded Monday afternoon. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, who was dismissed as a defendant in the case this summer, is set to testify on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/04/michigan-football-staffer-fired-after-allegedly-trying-meet-13-year-old-girl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/04/michigan-football-staffer-fired-after-allegedly-trying-meet-13-year-old-girl/</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Michigan Football Staffer Fired After Allegedly Trying to Meet 13-Year-Old Girl</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Michigan has fired football staffer Alex Yood after he was accused of attempting to meet up with a 13-year-old girl, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yood was apparently fired in September after the allegations appeared in an Instagram video that accused him of arranging to meet an underaged girl, 247 Sports reported on November 2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firing was confirmed on November 3 in an email sent by the university and reported by the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video that spurred the firing, Yood appears to admit that he was planning to meet a girl he was speaking to online.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confronted at a liquor store holding a bottle of spirits, Yood is told that the girl he is planning to meet is only 13. He replies that he didn&rsquo;t know her age but is told that some of the texts prove that he was aware she was only 13.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find the video in the article in my show notes, and it&rsquo;s about 10 minutes long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men in the video also claim that Yood asked the &ldquo;girl&rdquo; if she was a virgin. The men follow Yood out to his car, and he drives away as they yell at him and call him a pedophile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear what role the men who confronted Yood have in the incident or how they became privy to the text messages Yood allegedly sent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the video was apparently made by an online vigilante named Boopac Shakur, a man known for exposing sexual predators. In a wholly separate incident, Shakur was shot and killed in Michigan during an argument at the end of September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school apparently cut ties with Yood quickly afterward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alex Yood is no longer part of the athletic department,&rdquo; a school official told the Mail. &ldquo;An issue was brought to our attention, and we immediately moved to handle the matter with our HR department. &rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are unable to comment further regarding this employment matter,&rdquo; the email added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation with Yood only adds to the pressures on the University of Michigan football program as allegations of sign stealing continue reverberating, spurring calls for coach Jim Harbaugh to be fired.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>187K Migrants Apprehended at Border in First Month of New Year &mdash; 30K More Gotaways</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol agents assigned to the southwest border with Mexico apprehended more than 187,000 migrants during October &mdash; the first month of the new fiscal year. A source within U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated another 30,000 migrants were reported as &ldquo;known gotaways.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents assigned to the nine southwest Border Patrol sectors apprehended more than 187,000 migrants during October, according to documents reviewed by Breitbart Texas. This is the fourth consecutive month that agents apprehended more than 130,000 migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the more than 187,000 apprehensions, agents reported more than 30,000 migrants as known gotaways. This is a conservative estimate of migrants observed crossing the border but not apprehended by agents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unofficial report revealed the Tucson Sector had the most apprehensions. More than 55,000 migrants were apprehended in this sector alone. This is up from 51,000 in September. One year ago, agents in this sector apprehended less than 23,000 migrants. This represents a year-over-year increase of 149 percent over the prior October.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Del Rio Sector followed Tucson with the apprehension of approximately 38,000 migrants. This is down slightly from the nearly 43,000 migrants apprehended in October 2022 and is up significantly from the 28,000 apprehended in October 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rio Grande Valley, San Diego, and El Paso Sectors rounded out the top five sectors with approximately 32,000, 29,000, and 22,000, respectively. The Rio Grande Valley and San Diego Sectors are up significantly from the prior October reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the Canadian border, the Swanton Sector continues its spike in migrant apprehensions. Agents in the sector that covers the Canadian border in eastern New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire apprehended more than 1,000 migrants in the first month of FY24.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is up by nearly 200 percent over October 2022 and is roughly equal to the apprehensions for the entire Fiscal Year 2022.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blue City Hands Out Vehicle &lsquo;Tracking Tags&rsquo; To Residents Because People Keep Getting Their Cars Stolen</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced on Wednesday that she has started a pilot program that will give some drivers a tracking device to attach to their cars so they will be able to find their vehicle if it gets stolen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tags, which will be given to residents in six of the city&rsquo;s most vehicle theft-prone areas, will be installed inside the car and will be trackable via an app on the owner&rsquo;s phone, the mayor&rsquo;s office said in a press release. The devices appear to be Apple AirTags, according to a photo posted by Bowser on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto thefts in D.C. have increased 101% since last year, with 5,916 cars being stolen since January, police data showed. Violent crime in the city has increased 41%, while total crime has grown by 27% since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local officials claimed that the apps would help citizens recover their stolen cars more quickly and would allow officers to solve crimes more quickly or efficiently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our goal is not just to prevent carjackings and motor vehicle thefts, but also to ensure swift law enforcement action when these incidents occur,&rdquo; acting Chief of Police Pamela A. Smith said in the press release. &ldquo;These tracking devices allow our officers and detectives to be better positioned to quickly locate stolen vehicles, recover property, and gather vital evidence for investigations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowser has attempted to walk back the city&rsquo;s lenient approach toward crime in the past few months, unveiling a crime bill that eliminates several police reforms D.C. enacted after the George Floyd riots in 2020. D.C. first responders have said that they feel less safe because of the rising crime in the area, while many locals throughout the city complained at a House Judiciary meeting about the open crime that often takes place in broad daylight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Last week, we introduced legislation to address recent crime trends; this week, we are equipping residents with technology that will allow the Metropolitan Police Department to address these crimes, recover vehicles, and hold people accountable,&rdquo; Bowser said in the press release. &ldquo;[W]e will continue to use all the tools we have, and add new tools, to keep our city safe.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/01/exclusive-republicans-grill-hhs-unconstitutional-trans-pronoun-mandate-employees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/01/exclusive-republicans-grill-hhs-unconstitutional-trans-pronoun-mandate-employees/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Republicans Grill HHS Over &lsquo;Unconstitutional&rsquo; Trans Pronoun Mandate for Employees</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers are demanding answers from President Joe Biden&rsquo;s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) about its new guidelines ordering agency employees to refer to transgender coworkers by their &ldquo;preferred pronouns.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Mary Miller (R-IL) is leading several other GOP lawmakers in sending a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, grilling him for answers about the &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; guidance and how it applies to religious employees. Breitbart News exclusively obtained a copy of the letter on Wednesday before it was sent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We recently learned that the Biden Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is compelling political speech and violating the religious liberty rights of HHS employees by imposing a transgender pronoun mandate on your employees,&rdquo; the letter reads. &ldquo;We write to express our strong opposition to your illegal and unconstitutional transgender pronoun mandate, the so-called &lsquo;HHS Gender Non-Discrimination and Inclusion Policy,&rsquo; which is a violation of the First Amendment rights of HHS employees.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Your pronoun mandate clearly infringes upon the religious liberty and free speech rights of employees, who cannot be coerced into engaging in political speech or speech that violates their deeply held religious beliefs,&rdquo; the letter continues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers wrote the letter based on an alleged HHS internal email obtained by Roger Severino, vice president of domestic policy for the Heritage Foundation and former director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights during the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HHS, which employs approximately 80,000 people in the United States and abroad, imposed its new &ldquo;Gender Identity and Non-Discrimination Guidance&rdquo; in early October; it outlines &ldquo;employee rights and protections related to gender identity,&rdquo; the alleged email reads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;All employees should be addressed [by] the names and pronouns they use to describe themselves,&rdquo; the email continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HHS also posted a video to YouTube &mdash; designated as &ldquo;unlisted&rdquo; &mdash; in which HHS Secretary Andrea Palm says the policy allows colleagues &ldquo;to show up every day as their whole selves.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Zm3p1nKTPs8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/Zm3p1nKTPs8</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play 0:00-1:10</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Palm did mention religion, neither the video nor the email disclosed if the HHS plans on accommodating or exempting employees with religious objections to affirming transgender delusions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Rachel Levine, who describes himself as&nbsp; &ldquo;an out and proud transgender woman&rdquo; in the video, said this policy ensures that &ldquo;all HHS employees, including transgender and nonbinary employees, have equal protections in the workplace.&rdquo; He added that all supervisors and managers are responsible for enforcing the policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Every one of us can play a role in creating a welcoming workplace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every one of you can make a difference in improving the feelings of inclusion for your coworkers.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2023/10/31/us-seeks-to-ramp-up-munitions-production-for-ukraine-israel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2023/10/31/us-seeks-to-ramp-up-munitions-production-for-ukraine-israel/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>US seeks to ramp up munitions production for Ukraine, Israel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden&rsquo;s $106 billion defense spending supplemental request to Congress aims in part to bolster munitions production capacity to continue rushing arms to Ukraine and Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at a Tuesday hearing on the status of U.S. stockpiles and the workforce, supply chain and infrastructure constraints of weapons manufacturers racing to replenish them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate is formulating its supplemental spending bill encompassing both Ukraine and Israel aid, while the House is set to vote on a stand-alone Israel aid bill later this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There are some limitations in terms of how quickly they can do certain things,&rdquo; said Austin. &ldquo;There will continue to be workforce challenges. And when you expand capacity, there&rsquo;s this issue of the time it takes to build the capacity and make sure the lines are running smoothly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin noted some defense contractors have required workers to take on additional shifts to keep up with production rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What they&rsquo;ve done in a lot of cases to meet urgent needs is double and triple shifts so that they can in some cases crank out munitions and weapons at a much greater speed,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin&rsquo;s comments come as Israel rapidly burns through munitions as it continues to bomb the 2.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 8,500 people and wounding more than 21,500, per the Gaza Health Ministry. Shortly before the hearing, Israel bombed the Jabalia refugee camp, which the Health Ministry lambasted as a &ldquo;horrific massacre&rdquo; that killed at least 50 people and wounded hundreds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the latest of many civilian targets Israel has bombed in its campaign to destroy Hamas. Israel launched its campaign following Hamas&rsquo; massacre of approximately 1,400 Israelis and abduction of 240 hostages, per the Israel Defense Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, the Biden administration has less than $5.5 billion remaining to continue transferring weapons to Ukraine as the nation&rsquo;s slow-moving counteroffensive fails to retake significant tracts of territory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s requested defense supplemental includes $44.4 billion to continue arming Ukraine and $14.3 billion in military aid for Israel. That request includes more Iron Dome interceptors to stop Hamas rockets and additional munitions for Israel to continue its bombardment of Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large portion of the requested funding would go toward backfilling U.S. stockpiles of weapons the Biden administration has so far sent Ukraine and Israel. There&rsquo;s also $3 billion requested to expand industrial base capacity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We simply do not have the workforce, supply chain or infrastructure necessary to meet the coming threats,&rdquo; Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., said at the hearing. &ldquo;Building out this capacity is going to take time and resources, but we can start now by making targeted investments in our munitions production base.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s supplemental request includes $30 billion to replenish weapons sent to Ukraine as well as funding to backfill stocks given to Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As a general rule, we&rsquo;re going to do everything that we can to meet the demands that we see in both Ukraine and Israel,&rdquo; Austin said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and NATO continue to face a shortage of 155mm ammunition and are providing those shells both to Ukraine and Israel.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/01/adam-johnsons-aunt-demanding-justice-after-reckless-kick-that-left-him-dead/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/01/adam-johnsons-aunt-demanding-justice-after-reckless-kick-that-left-him-dead/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adam Johnson&rsquo;s Aunt Demanding &lsquo;Justice&rsquo; After &lsquo;Reckless&rsquo; Kick that Left Him Dead</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former NHL player Adam Johnson&rsquo;s family is demanding that officials in the U.K. do something to bring justice to the man whose actions ended Johnson&rsquo;s life during an Oct. 28 game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 29-year-old Johnson, who played with the Pittsburgh Penguins from 2018 to 2020, was playing in a Challenge Cup game for the Nottingham Panthers against the Sheffield Steelers in the UK&rsquo;s Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) when Steelers player Matt Petgrave raised his leg into the air and slammed Johnson in the neck with his deadly skate blade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson was rushed to a local hospital, but he lost too much blood and was pronounced dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Johnson&rsquo;s 62-year-old aunt is charging that Petgrave&rsquo;s actions were negligent, and she wants the police in the U.K. to charge him in Johnson&rsquo;s death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It was very reckless,&rdquo; Kari Johnson said of the &ldquo;horrific tragedy&rdquo; of her nephew&rsquo;s death, according to the New York Post. &ldquo;I just want them [authorities investigating] to get it right. We are looking for justice for Adam.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Pergrave&rsquo;s kick was &ldquo;not hockey&rdquo; and insisted, &ldquo;My nephew was 6 feet tall, and whether you lost your balance or not, to have that leg come up that high and do a kicking motion like he did, that is just unacceptable.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a hockey play, that&rsquo;s not a check. I understand that every team has an enforcer, per se, on their team,&rdquo; Johnson reiterated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Kari Johnson has carefully noted that she does not think Petgrave struck Johnson in the neck with his skate on purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Petgrave probably didn&rsquo;t even think about the consequences could be of that happening, but there comes a time when you have to realize that&rsquo;s not hockey,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s going through a lot, too, but he took our boy. There are a few of us in the family that think it was a totally unnecessary, very, very bad action to take.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Petgrave, he is reportedly &ldquo;distraught&rdquo; and has been &ldquo;receiving vile messages online.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, South Yorkshire Police officials said they are investigating the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police did not say, though, if they were investigating the incident as a criminal act.</span></p>]]></description>
