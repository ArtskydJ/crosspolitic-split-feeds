   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FLF Conference Plug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word didn&rsquo;t stay in Heaven. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory of the Father, full of grace and truth. Grace and Truth became flesh. The Word became flesh. The story of God&rsquo;s grace became flesh. And it is that Word, that truth, that story that will fill the world. That is why this year&rsquo;s Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee is on Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. The Word is a sword. The Word is our glory. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, speakers including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, Ben Merkle, Jared Longshore, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, Chocolate Knox will be doing a round table with the Wilsons and Merkles on why stories are so potent for building family cultures that wine, all culminating in a live show with Megan Basham and Jason Whitlock talking Lies and Journalism. And we just announced a one day Saturday-only pass for 99$. Find out more and register or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Toby Sumpter, and today is Friday, September 16th, and this is your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gavin-newsom-asks-consider-kidnapping-charges-gop-governors-ship-migrants-out-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gavin-newsom-asks-consider-kidnapping-charges-gop-governors-ship-migrants-out-state</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span><a href="https://www.gavinnewsom.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Gavin Newsom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has asked the Department of Justice to look into whether sending migrants to other parts of the country constituted kidnapping or other federal crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Newsom asked whether actions by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sending illegal immigrants from their respective states to destinations such as New York City, Washington, D.C. Chicago, and Martha's Vineyard were illegal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Several of the individuals who were transported to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard have alleged that a recruiter induced them to accept the offer of travel based on false representations that they would be transported to Boston and would receive expedited access to work authorization," Newsom wrote. "I urge US DOJ to investigate whether the alleged fraudulent inducement would support charges of kidnapping under relevant state laws."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis most recently sent migrants to Massachusetts on Wednesday after promising he would relocate them to a "sanctuary destination."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"States like Massachusetts, New York and California will better facilitate the care of these individuals who they have invited into our country by incentivizing illegal immigration through their designation as &lsquo;sanctuary states&rsquo; and support for the Biden administration&rsquo;s open border policies," the governor&rsquo;s communications director, Taryn Fenske, told Fox News Digital.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, more and more young people have reported feeling anxious or depressed as a result of the dire warnings about </span><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/climate-alarmism-creates-potential-for-us-food-insecurity-as-anti-farm-sentiment-grows/?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are </span><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/watch-john-kerry-pushes-for-more-green-energy-while-experts-warn-about-energy-shortages?&amp;utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to them everywhere they look. Perhaps nowhere is this more prevalent than in institutions of higher learning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to address the mental health consequences of being constantly warned that the planet is on its last leg, there has been a push from within colleges and universities to provide </span><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/al-gore-compares-climate-change-skeptics-to-uvalde-cops-who-let-school-kids-get-slaughtered/?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counseling services to students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, members of the </span><a href="https://sustain.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11_Climate%20Change%20and%20Mental%20Health_Kluttz.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of British Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s Sustainability Initiative released a report detailing the relationship between climate change and mental health, offering a "systemic approach to action in post-secondary education."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Direct and indirect stressors from climate change," they wrote, "as well as the overarching psychological and psychosocial challenges associated with acknowledging the magnitude of the crisis, lead to mental distress and disrupt mental health and wellbeing. Addressing the challenges that the climate crisis poses to mental health, and finding ways to live with and adapt to the overarching psychological and psychosocial weight of the crisis is needed to build healthy and resilient individuals and communities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report recommended that existing counselors be trained to discuss climate change, and that more direct lines of communication be opened between them and climate change activist groups on campus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the University of Michigan, a pilot program has been set up creating a therapy group that will meet for one hour every week for just over three months to see how receiving emotional support can help students overcome their anxiety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant director of the University of Oregon&rsquo;s Office of Sustainability, Sarah Stoeckl, argued that without such services available to students, they will feel "paralyzed in &hellip; uncomfortable emotions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the counselors who have chosen to integrate knowledge of climate change into their skillset, some have argued that "eco-anxiety" is unlike other mental health challenges in that in this case, "the psychological part is really meant to go hand in hand with climate action."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research from </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lancet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 84 percent of children and young adults around the world are "at least moderately worried" about climate change, while over half said they are "very or extremely worried."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most striking, however, was the finding that 45 percent of those surveyed said that their thoughts and feelings about climate change "negatively affected their daily life and functioning," with many reporting a "high number of negative thoughts about climate change."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe we could just tell the kids the truth?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailysceptic.org/2022/09/14/climate-emergency-not-supported-by-data-say-four-leading-italian-scientists/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailysceptic.org/2022/09/14/climate-emergency-not-supported-by-data-say-four-leading-italian-scientists/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: earlier this week it was reported that four leading Italian scientists have undertaken a </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-02243-9.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of historical climate trends and concluded that declaring a &lsquo;climate emergency&rsquo; is not supported by the data. Reviewing data from a wide range of weather phenomena, they say a &lsquo;climate crisis&rsquo; of the kind people are becoming alarmed about &ldquo;is not evident yet&rdquo;. The scientists suggest that rather than burdening our children with anxiety about climate change, we should encourage them to think about issues like energy, food and health, and the challenges in each area, with a more &ldquo;objective and constructive spirit&rdquo; and not waste limited resources on &ldquo;costly and ineffective solutions&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/harvard-students-could-be-punished-for-not-using-preferred-pronouns-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/harvard-students-could-be-punished-for-not-using-preferred-pronouns-report</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course this is not at all unrelated to the fact that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/title-ix"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> training at </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/harvard-university"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reportedly told students that failing to use a person's preferred </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/transgender-issues"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pronoun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be a violation of university policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mandatory training contained multiple fictional scenarios explaining possible violations of the university's Title IX policies, including one in which a student repeatedly uses the "wrong pronouns" to address someone while making comments about gender identity, </span><a href="https://freebeacon.com/campus/harvard-tells-students-using-wrong-pronouns-constitutes-abuse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Free Beacon</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The training said the behavior described in the scenario "contribute[s] to a climate of disrespect and may also violate Harvard's policies." Violations of university Title IX policy on sexual harassment can be punished by "admonition" or even "termination, dismissal, [or] expulsion."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another slide contained a diagram of a "Power and Control Wheel," which reportedly detailed a number of possible behaviors that could violate the university's policies, including sexual, verbal, emotional, and physical abuse, as well as "cultural/identity abuse," which included "using the wrong pronouns."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wheel diagram is surrounded by words describing "attitudes, beliefs, and systems," including "racism, xenophobia, sexism, classism, cisheterosexism, ableism-sizeism &amp; fat-phobia."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard's treatment of incorrect pronoun use as a violation of Title IX is not unique. In May, a school district in Wisconsin initiated disciplinary proceedings against three male students who refused to address another student by his or her preferred pronouns. In June, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/fairfax-schools-students-right-secret-gender"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County Public Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strengthened district policies that could see students punished for the same infraction.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/mike-lindell-fbi-seizes-cellphone"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/mike-lindell-fbi-seizes-cellphone</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Lindell says the FBI confiscated his cell phone at drive-thru of a Hardee's</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillow entrepreneur Mike Lindell claimed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation confiscated his cell phone while he was at a Hardee's restaurant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindell made the revelation in a video posted to social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1569847934849634306"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1569847934849634306</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindell further elaborated about the incident on his show, "The Lindell Report." He said he was going through the Hardee's drive-thru when FBI agents approached him and demanded he hand over his phone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that he eventually handed over his phone after consulting his lawyer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindell said that the search warrant was likely related to his claims about voting machines manufactured by the Dominion company. He has been one of the foremost proponents of the conspiracy theory that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump through the use of fraudulent voting machines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search warrant was likely a part of a dozens of subpoenas reportedly issued by the Department of Justice in connection to the probe into efforts to overturn the official results of the election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion filed a $1.3 billion lawsuit in February 2021 over Lindell's accusations. He issued a defiant response over the lawsuit in January.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I want Dominion to put up their lawsuit because we have 100% evidence that China and other countries used their machines to steal the election," Lindell said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/white-house-grapples-to-avoid-nationwide-railroad-strike-that-could-send-gas-prices-soaring-hamstring-supply-chain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/white-house-grapples-to-avoid-nationwide-railroad-strike-that-could-send-gas-prices-soaring-hamstring-supply-chain</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House Grapples To Avoid Nationwide Railroad Strike That Could Send Gas Prices Soaring, Hamstring Supply Chain</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House is seeking to prevent a nationwide railroad strike that could worsen supply chain bottlenecks and increase gas prices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific announced embargoes on certain shipments earlier this week as negotiations continue with two of the nation&rsquo;s largest rail unions &mdash; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and SMART Transportation Division. The Biden administration created a Presidential Emergency Board via executive order two months ago to facilitate the negotiations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have made crystal clear to the interested parties the harm that American families, businesses and farmers, and communities would experience if they were not to reach a resolution,&rdquo; White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday, adding that the administration is working with shipping, trucking, and air freight companies to &ldquo;see how they can step in and keep goods moving in case of this rail shutdown.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is slated to host union leaders and rail company executives on Wednesday morning, according to a statement from a Department of Labor spokesperson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain bottlenecks driven by widespread labor shortages and lockdowns in Asian manufacturing hubs have impacted the American economy over the past two years, contributing to higher inflation as consumer goods fail to reach shelves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily cost of a nationwide rail shutdown could amount to $2 billion, according to a report from the Association of American Railroads. Moving shipments to truckers would require the equivalent of 467,000 additional long-haul trucks per day &mdash; growth that would take &ldquo;years of concerted effort&rdquo; to achieve, especially amid a shortage of more than 80,000 truck drivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Retail Industry Leaders Association explained in a July letter to the Biden administration that freight rail accounts for 40% of long-distance shipping volume &mdash; &ldquo;more than any other mode of transportation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the White House suggested increasing railroad employee pay by 24% over the next two years &mdash; a measure that would lead to an average raise of $11,000 per employee. &ldquo;An agreement based on these terms would lead to the largest general wage increase in nearly 40 years,&rdquo; Association of American Railroads CEO Ian Jefferies said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas prices could increase between $0.35 and $0.75 per gallon if a railroad strike continued for multiple days, warned GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan. &ldquo;Since ethanol primarily moves via rail, and much of the nation blends ethanol into all grades, it would be a big challenge,&rdquo; he remarked on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national average price of gasoline was $2.38 per gallon when Biden assumed office and increased to $3.53 per gallon by the start of the Russian invasion. After surpassing $5.00 per gallon in early June, prices have subsided to $3.70 per gallon as of Wednesday, according to data from AAA.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPAC Pressuring Every GOP Office To Support Bill Banning Gender Surgeries On Minors</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC) sent a letter Tuesday to every Republican in the House of Representatives, calling on them to cosponsor a bill that would ban gender surgeries on minors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter, which was first obtained by the Daily Caller, was sent to every House Republican Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff and Legislative Director and urges them to back Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene&rsquo;s &ldquo;Protect Children&rsquo;s Innocence Act.&rdquo; The bill charges any person who knowingly performed gender-affirming care on a minor with a Class C Felony, which could put them in prison for 10 to 25 years or require a maximum $250,000 fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, originally introduced on Aug. 19, also prohibits all taxpayer-funded gender-affirming care, prohibits institutions of higher education from providing instruction on gender-affirming care, and more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Across the country we have seen the radical gender politics of the Woke Left infiltrate all facets of our lives. As a result, the Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC) has undertaken an effort to drive legislation throughout the country to protect children from the Left&rsquo;s radical gender theory in schools, sports, and medicine,&rdquo; the letter reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As such, we view Rep. Taylor Greene&rsquo;s Protect Children&rsquo;s Innocence Act as common-sense legislation meant to protect children. Accordingly, CPAC supports the Protect Children&rsquo;s Innocence Act and urges you to co-sponsor the legislation,&rdquo; the letter continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Caller reported Tuesday that the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction promotes transgender video and reading resources explicitly aimed at preschoolers, according to a guide titled &ldquo;Resources for Gender Expansive Preschoolers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2022/09/14/almost-half-san-francisco-residents-say-were-victims-of-crime-in-past-5-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2022/09/14/almost-half-san-francisco-residents-say-were-victims-of-crime-in-past-5-years/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly half of all San Francisco, California, residents say that they have been victims of crime in the past five years, according to a survey conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chronicle reported Tuesday:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sweeping poll commissioned by The Chronicle drew sobering results: Nearly half of respondents said they were victims of theft in the last five years, while roughly a quarter were physically attacked or threatened. The majority had negative impressions of law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SFNext poll asked a random sample of 1,653 city residents more than 90 questions about numerous aspects of life in San Francisco. It was conducted in late June and July, and respondents reflect the city&rsquo;s demographics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-five percent of people surveyed for the poll said they had an item stolen within the last five years. Proportionally, Black and mixed-race respondents felt a more severe impact than other groups, with a majority &mdash; 54% of Black respondents and 55% of mixed-race respondents &mdash; reporting they had suffered theft. Property crime rates were lower for white residents, 43% of whom had a possession swiped within the time period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics of the poll suggest that it may have underreported crimes against Asian-American residents, who feel vulnerable lately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chronicle also reported that two-thirds (65%) of residents said life in the city had declined since they had moved there: &ldquo;[T]he greatest unhappiness stems from frustration with the city&rsquo;s biggest, seemingly intractable problems &mdash; particularly homelessness, public safety and housing affordability &mdash; as well as with the politicians who haven&rsquo;t solved them yet.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Marathon Creates &lsquo;Nonbinary&rsquo; Category for 2023 Race</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston Marathon has succumbed to the next radical LGBTQ agenda by creating a &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo; category for runners who claim to be neither male nor female.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston Athletic Association confirmed on Monday that the new category would be included in all its races, including the 5K, 10K, and the half marathon going forward, according to the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new category was seen in the registration information released Monday for the Marathon&rsquo;s 127th run set to be held on April 17, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials have not yet finished crafting its qualifying standards for so-called &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo; runners, but the online applications will include nonbinary as a gender option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;&lsquo;Discussions are ongoing with nonbinary athletes in an effort to further promote inclusion at all BAA events. We view this first year as an opportunity to learn and grow together,&rdquo; the BAA said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston Marathon is not the first race to add such a category. Race organizations in Philadelphia and Brooklyn have already set up nonbinary categories for sponsored races.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some on social media worried that allowing nonbinary runners will lower standards for entrants. One social media user, for instance, noted that if they don&rsquo;t make the standards hew toward the higher male standards, slower runners will abuse the category just to get qualified in a race for which it is notoriously hard to win entry.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk's Twitter buyout deal APPROVED by shareholders</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Twitter&rsquo;s shareholders voted to approve Elon Musk&rsquo;s $44 billion buyout deal that was set in motion earlier this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Verge, sources yesterday had suggested that a vast majority of shareholders were set to approve of the bid, with the required majority being locked in before Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote comes as Musk is locked in a legal battle with the social media platform over an attempt to terminate the deal, after Musk sought data that confirmed that the number of Twitter accounts that are automated bot accounts is less than 5 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter sued Musk for his attempts to terminate the deal, arguing that Musk created their agreement. The trial is expected to begin in mid-October.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a developing story, so check back with me tomorrow for more updates:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-inflation-comes-in-worse-than-expected-as-food-shelter-costs-surge_4726956.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-inflation-comes-in-worse-than-expected-as-food-shelter-costs-surge_4726956.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Inflation Comes in Higher Than Expected as Food, Shelter Costs Surge</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. annual inflation rate came in at 8.3 percent in August, higher than the market forecast of 8.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This is slightly down from the 8.5 percent reading in July.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core inflation rate, which strips the volatile food and energy sectors, also advanced to 6.3 percent last month. This was also higher than the market expectation of 6.1 percent and up from 5.9 percent in July.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a monthly basis, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1 percent, while the core CPI surged 0.6 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food and shelter costs contributed to the inflation numbers as they increased 11.4 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively, year-over-year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The energy index eased to 23.8 percent, new vehicles surged 10.1 percent, used cars and trucks jumped 7.8 percent, and apparel edged up 5.1 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation services soared 11.3 percent and medical care services swelled 5.6 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the food index, most items were up on both a year-over-year and month-over-month basis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bread prices rose 16.2 percent from the same time a year ago, milk soared 17 percent, eggs spiked 39.8 percent, and fruits and vegetables surged 9.4 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BLS data further showed that meat was mostly up across the board, with uncooked ground beef up 7.8 percent, chicken jumping 16.6 percent, ham rising 9.2 percent, and pork surging 6.8 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a positive note, airline fares, which were up by about 33 percent year-over-year, fell by 4.6 percent on a monthly basis in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the energy front, prices also eased considerably from July to August. Fuel oil slipped 5.9 percent and gasoline declined 10.6 percent. However, electricity prices added 1.5 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks reacted to the hot inflation report. The Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 were down 2.7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, during midday trading on Sept. 13, while the NASDAQ was down 3.85 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial markets have cheered anytime there is the slightest hint of easing inflationary pressures because investors think this would prompt the Federal Reserve to slow down its pace of rate hikes or to cut interest rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central bank officials have repeatedly stated that they do not intend to turn dovish during this tightening cycle until there is clear evidence that inflation is on a downward trend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed Chair Jerome Powell spooked financial markets last month when he told the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium that households and businesses need to brace for &ldquo;some pain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just what our economy needed! More pain&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/stocks-tumble-after-inflation-stays-hotter-than-expected_4727580.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/stocks-tumble-after-inflation-stays-hotter-than-expected_4727580.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks Tumble After Inflation Stays Hotter Than Expected</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks are tumbling and disappointment is shaking markets worldwide Tuesday, following Wall Street&rsquo;s realization that inflation isn&rsquo;t slowing as much as hoped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S&amp;P 500 sank 2.3 percent in early trading Tuesday, threatening to snap a four-day winning streak. Bond prices also fell sharply, sending their yields higher, after a report showed inflation decelerated to 8.3 percent in August, instead of the 8.1 percent economists expected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disappointing data means traders are bracing for the Federal Reserve to ultimately raise rates even higher than expected to combat inflation, with all the risks for the economy that entails.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 603 points, or 1.9 percent, to 31,777, as of 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.1 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all of Wall Street came into the day thinking the Fed would hike its key short-term rate by a hefty three-quarters of a percentage point at its meeting next week. But the hope was that inflation was in the midst of quickly falling back to more normal levels after peaking in June at 9.1 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inflation report arrived before trading began on Wall Street, but it sent a thud through markets worldwide.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">15,000 Union Nurses in Minnesota Begin Strike, Citing Low Wages, Understaffing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 15,000 union nurses at 15 hospitals across seven different health systems in Minnesota have walked off the job, protesting understaffing and overwork in what&rsquo;s believed to be the biggest strike of private-sector nurses in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minnesota Nurses Association strike, slated to last three days, began at 7 a.m. on Sept. 12. The group&rsquo;s membership voted last month to authorize a strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nurses in the Minneapolis and Duluth areas are complaining about low pay, a dearth of resources, and the inability to care for patients properly, such as running wards without lead nurses, and poor shift-scheduling practices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give my patients the care they deserve,&rdquo; said Chris Rubesch, the vice president of the Minnesota Nurses Association and a nurse at Essentia Health in Duluth, according to The Washington Post. &ldquo;Call lights go unanswered. Patients should only be waiting for a few seconds or minutes if they&rsquo;ve soiled themselves or their oxygen came unplugged or they need to go to the bathroom, but that can take 10 minutes or more. Those are things that can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Sept. 1 news conference, Minnesota Nurses Association President Mary Turner said, &ldquo;Our health care and our profession are in crisis.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Response From Hospitals</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While negotiations have been continuing since March, the union decided to proceed with the strike because of the hospitals&rsquo; offer of about 10 percent wage increases over three years. The union had asked initially for a 37 percent boost, before settling on 30 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the Twin Cities Hospitals Group called the request &ldquo;unreasonable, unrealistic, and unaffordable,&rdquo; according to the Minnesota Reformer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospital administrations have hired replacement staff and traveling nurses to keep operations running and bring minimal disruption to patient care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Nurses have steadfastly refused to go to mediation,&rdquo; Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the Twin Cities Hospital Group, which represents four hospital systems, told The Washington Post. &ldquo;Their choice is to strike. This strike is on the nurses.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans Like Work From Home So Much, They&rsquo;ll Take a Pay Cut to Keep It: Study</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers in the United States are willing to take a pay cut so that they can continue working from home, states a study published in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work from home (WFH) was found to average 1.5 days a week worldwide, according to the study conducted by a team of international economists and other experts. The study, &ldquo;Working From Home Around the World,&rdquo; surveyed full-time workers from 27 nations as of mid-2021 and early 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers were found to value the option of working from home for two to three days per week so much that they were willing to take a pay cut of 5 percent on average. In the United States, workers were willing to take a 5.7 percent pay cut for remote work options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, workers across countries wanted 1.7 work-from-home days per week after the end of the pandemic. In the United States, the mean desired WFH days per week was at 2.1. However, the actual WFH days in the country was 1.6 while employers were only planning to offer 0.8 days for remote work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, 5.26 percent of employees working from home for one or more days per week were willing to quit their job if their employer wanted them to return to onsite work for more than five days. In the United States, this number exceeded 40 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, the risk that city-level fortunes will diverge due to work-from-home models is &ldquo;more acute&rdquo; than in other rich nations, the report noted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In part, because political decisions about the provision of local public goods are more decentralized in the United States, and local fiscal resources are more closely tied to local economic prosperity. These aspects of federalism give rise to more scope for a downward spiral in city-level fiscal resources and urban amenities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to other countries, the United States also has more location options sharing the same legal system, cultures, language, etc. As such, if a city&rsquo;s governance were to fail, it is easier to move to another similar but better-performing city, the report stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a report showing that many remote working jobs which popped up during the COVID-19 pandemic have remained open and are expected to remain open in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFL legend Michael Irvin eviscerates idea of Colin Kaepernick joining Cowboys: 'Let's just stop'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Playmaker was not having it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Dak Prescott went down for what might be 6-8 weeks with an injury to his throwing thumb, the &ldquo;First Take&rdquo; crew was bouncing around ideas on what Dallas should do in the interim. Tyler Huntley was broached, but no one ultimately thought that the Ravens would part with him with Lamar Jackson unsigned. Stephen A. Smith brought up Colin Kaepernick, and Michael Irvin shot the idea down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-l0Ao24SpVQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/-l0Ao24SpVQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Play 2:35-4:37</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you notice that Smith tried to back away from the bag of crap that he just lit on fire, and left it for all of us to smell? &ldquo;Oh no I just had five or so people bring it up to me, so I thought I&rsquo;d ask!&rdquo; Yeah nice try buddy, we all know you&rsquo;re just a puppet trying to keep this conversation going about Kaepernick. Even when Kap has ability, he wasn&rsquo;t even that good. He was something new in the league when he helped lead the 49ers to the Superbowl against the Ravens all the way back in 2013&hellip; but since that season, his numbers fell off a cliff&hellip; people clinged to the notion that he was a great qb, all for the sake of pumping up his national anthem protest&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaepernick hasn&rsquo;t played in the NFL since 2016, when he kneeled during the national anthem to protest social injustice while a member of the 49ers. Smith has said in the past that former President Donald Trump inflaming this story was revenge on NFL owners for not allowing him to buy the Bills.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, September 13th, 2022. I hope you all had a restful weekend with your loved ones, so without further adieu, let me remind you about our conference!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FLF Conference Plug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you like Jesus &amp; beer? Then you and your family need to come to the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee, on October 6-8. The topic of this conference is Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. Satan is the father of lies, and the mother of those lies is a government that has rejected God. Christians haven&rsquo;t been reading their Bibles, so we as a society are more susceptible than ever to satan and his lies. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, and more&hellip; AND, stuff for the kids too, like jumpy castles, and accidental infant baptisms! Sign up to attend with you and yours, or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, now let&rsquo;s get to the news!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://reason.com/2022/09/12/americans-spent-more-on-taxes-last-year-than-on-food-health-care-education-and-clothing-combined/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://reason.com/2022/09/12/americans-spent-more-on-taxes-last-year-than-on-food-health-care-education-and-clothing-combined/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans Spent More on Taxes Last Year Than on Food, Health Care, Education, and Clothing Combined</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yikes. New consumer spending data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides some sobering perspective on how much Americans are paying in taxes. The data covers consumer spending across a wide variety of categories in 2021. Overall, taxes accounted for about 25 percent of average consumer spending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BLS measures spending per "consumer unit," which it describes as "either (1) all members of a particular household who are related by blood, marriage, adoption or other legal arrangements; (2) persons living alone or sharing a household with others or living as a roomer in a private home or lodging house or in a permanent living quarters in a hotel or motel, but who is financially independent; or (3) two or more person living together who use their income to make joint expenditure decisions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, each "consumer unit" paid more than $16,000 in taxes last year. This outpaces average spending on food, clothing, education, and health care combined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mean for total spending per unit on health care, food, education, and clothing was $16,721.42. This included an average of $8,289.28 on food, $5,451.61 on health care, $1,226.14 on education, and $1,754.39 on apparel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mean for total spending per unit on taxes was $16,729.73. This included $8,561.46 in federal income tax, $2,564.14 in state and local income taxes, $2,475.18 in property taxes, $5,565.45 in Social Security deductions, and $105.21 in other taxes, offset by an average stimulus payment of $2,541.71.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to this disturbing tidbit, the new BLS data contains a wealth of other information on American spending habits and offers an interesting glimpse at recovery&mdash;and inflation&mdash;during the second year of the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highest expenditure category was housing, at an average $22,623.55 per consumer unit (including property taxes). Major spending categories aside from housing, food, health care, education, and clothing included transportation ($10,961.18), utilities/fuels/public services ($4,223.49), entertainment ($3,567.89), household operations ($1,638.42), and personal care products and services ($770.51).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of numbers for you guys on that one&hellip; moving on:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/Sex-traffickers-nabbed-in-florida-sting-include-disney-employees-police-deputy?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/Sex-traffickers-nabbed-in-florida-sting-include-disney-employees-police-deputy?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex traffickers nabbed in Florida sting include Disney employees, police deputy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Florida sex trafficking sting known as "Operation Fall Haul II" captured a 160 culprits this week with a list that included several Disney employees, a teacher, and Georgia Deputy Police Chief Jason DiPrima.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to local news, DiPrima was considered an up-and-comer in the Georgia force and Sheriff Grady Judd, who ran the sting, said, "If all else fails, he could write a book, 'How to Ruin Your Career in Three Easy Steps.'"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sting operation started on August 29, lasted one week, and was a multi-agency effort led by the Polk County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office (PSCO) Vice Unit. Their efforts found and rescued at least two sex trafficking victims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former cop DiPrima was arrested after he tried to solicit an escort while attending the American Polygraph Association seminar in Orlando on August 31. He thought he was speaking to a sex worker, but was actually talking to an undercover PSCO detective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cartersville Police Department said in a press release that DiPrima had resigned Thursday following the department placing him on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/09/12/biden-loosens-tech-export-restrictions-on-china/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/09/12/biden-loosens-tech-export-restrictions-on-china/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Quietly Loosens Tech Export Rules to Chinese Communist Firms Just Days After Huawei Lobbyist&rsquo;s Brother Joins White House.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House quietly loosened Trump-era restrictions on the sharing of U.S. technology with firms blacklisted for their ties to the Chinese Communist Party, including the controversial Huawei, The National Pulse can report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commerce Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issued a revision to a Trump-era Export Administration Regulations (EAR) newly authorizing the release of certain technology and software for the alleged purpose of &ldquo;standards setting and development in standards organizations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move, which applies to firms that have been blacklisted by the U.S. government, was advertised as addressing confusion over whether American companies need a license to share &ldquo;low-level&rdquo;technology with sanctioned parties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Huawei Technologies Co. &ndash; which was included in the original export ban, as telecommunications firm has extensive links to the Chinese Communist Party &ndash; will now be able to receive certain technologies from American companies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labeled a &ldquo;national security threat&rdquo; by the Trump administration and a decades-long Chinese military collaborator by the U.S. Department of Defense, Huawei routinely provides the regime backdoor access to its products, networks, and devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Department has also emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party uses Huawei as an &ldquo;instrument not only for making money but also for pursuing the Party-State&rsquo;s agenda and fulfilling its strategic objectives [&hellip;] deeply enmeshed in Beijing&rsquo;s system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes after months of wrangling by Huawei lobbyists, those of whom include leading anti-Trump and pro-Biden individuals, such as Trump impeachment support Stephen Binhak, and the brothers of both Biden advisor Steve Richetti and newly minted Biden climate czar John Podesta.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine hails snowballing offensive, blames Russia for blackouts</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian forces kept pushing north in the Kharkiv region and advancing to its south and east, Ukraine's army chief said on Sunday, a day after their rapid surge forward drove Russia to abandon its main bastion in the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian officials accused retreating Russian forces of launching retaliatory attacks on civilian infrastructure, including a thermal power station in Kharkiv, that the authorities in Kyiv said caused widespread blackouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"No military facilities, the goal is to deprive people of light &amp; heat," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter of the attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow denies its forces deliberately target civilians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskiy has described Ukraine's offensive as a potential breakthrough in the six-month-old war, and said the winter could see further territorial gains if Kyiv received more powerful weapons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the worst defeat for Moscow's forces since they were repelled from the outskirts of the capital Kyiv in March, thousands of Russian soldiers left behind ammunition and equipment as they fled the city of Izium, which they had used as a logistics hub.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now we gotta finish with my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Irish teacher has been jailed for refusing to call a boy a girl, Queen Elizabeth II has died, and jail time is being threatened in Europe for turning the heat up too high this winter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&hellip; and more on today&rsquo;s CrossPolitic Daily News Brief. My name is Toby Sumpter and today is Friday, September 9, 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/06/teacher-enoch-burke-jailed-over-trans-pronouns-flap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/09/06/teacher-enoch-burke-jailed-over-trans-pronouns-flap/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A teacher in Ireland has been suspended from work and then jailed for contempt of court after he refused to use the correct pronouns to address a transgender student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enoch Burke was arrested on Monday for violating a court order barring him from teaching at Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School in Westmeath, or even being present there, </span><a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2022/0905/1320639-enoch-burke/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the news site RTE.ie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Michael Quinn found Burke guilty of violating an order made by the High Court last week and sent him to Mountjoy Prison, where he will remain until either he purges his contempt or the court gives further orders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teacher remained defiant in the face of jail time, telling the judge that &ldquo;it is insanity&rdquo; that he would be led out of the courtroom and taken to prison for refusing to give up his Christian beliefs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I love my school, with its motto Res Non Verba, &lsquo;Actions not words,&rsquo; but I am here today because I said I would not call a boy a girl,&rdquo; Burke told the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scandal surrounding Burke began unfolding after the educator, who teaches history, politics and German at the school in Multyfarnham, County Westmeath, refused to address a transitioning student as &ldquo;they&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;he.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burke&rsquo;s stance prompted school officials to place him on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a disciplinary process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the teacher refused to stay away from campus, despite an injunction that was issued barring him from going to the school, or attempting to teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the judge issued an order to arrest Burke after he was found sitting in an empty classroom at the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burke was taken into custody at the school on Monday and taken directly to court, where he told the judge he could not comply with the injunction because it would violate his conscience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I am a teacher and I don&rsquo;t want to go to prison,&rdquo; Burke told the court. &ldquo;I want to be in my classroom today, that&rsquo;s where I was this morning when I was arrested.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added: &ldquo;Transgenderism is against my Christian belief. It is contrary to the scriptures, contrary to the ethos of the Church of Ireland and of my school.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her son King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was a "moment of great sadness" for him and his family and that her loss would be "deeply felt" around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said: "We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the coming period of mourning, he said he and his family would be "comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King and his wife, Camilla, now Queen Consort, will return to London on Friday, Buckingham Palace said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior royals had gathered at Balmoral after the Queen's doctors became concerned about her health earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the Queen's children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, also gathered there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Liz Truss, who was appointed by the Queen on Tuesday, said the monarch was the rock on which modern Britain was built, who had "provided us with the stability and strength that we needed".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking about the new King, she said: "We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King'."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1567928907411910656?s=20&amp;t=jRqdyIeyvfjUj4nDBZFGsg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1567928907411910656?s=20&amp;t=jRqdyIeyvfjUj4nDBZFGsg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, earlier this morning Uju Anya, Critical Race Theorist at Carnegie Mellon University tweeted: &ldquo;I heard the chief monarch of a thieving raping genocidl empire is finally dying. May her pain be excruciating.&rdquo; Twitter did delete the Tweet as violating its rules, but i a follow up tweet she wrote: &ldquo;If anyone expects me to express anything but disdain for the monarch who supervised a government that sponsored the genocide that massacred and displaced half my family and the consequences of which those alive today are still trying to overcome, you can keep wishing upon a star.&rdquo; Another tweet insists that Queen Elizabeth was not a remnant of colonial times but an active participant in colonialism, &ldquo;she actively tried to stop independence movements &amp; she tried to keep newly independent colonies form leaving the commonwealth. The evil she did was enough&rdquo; and a video is linked to an elderly Kenyan woman who says she was tortured with axes during Kenya&rsquo;s struggle for independence from British colonial rule. The woman in the video demands that Elizabeth pay her back for what was done to to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uju Anya writes so-called &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; curriculum for public schools as well as Diversity Equity and Inclusion training materials. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s doing a lot of good. Not really.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple point I want to make here is that this is a great example of how CRT is not helping anyone at all. Let&rsquo;s grant the possibility that the history is being presented accurately here. I suspect that there might be more to it than is being presented, but let&rsquo;s just grant it for the sake of the argument. You cannot build families, cultures, or nations on this kind of exacting demand for justice. You cannot get it. It&rsquo;s not possible. And it&rsquo;s not possible for two reasons at least: first, you can&rsquo;t quantify the damage and harm and hurt. Can you put that woman&rsquo;s tears in a bottle and measure them out? When would it be enough? It would never be enough. And second, what standard would you use to measure anyway? By what standard? If you appeal to Darwin, you just threw away your standard. If you appeal to Marx, then you are only appealing to a momentary revolution and you&rsquo;re condemned to eternal feuding, since once the oppressed class gets put in charge they will no doubt oppress the previously ruling class, and we will just play see-saw with revenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way out of this is the blood of Jesus. The only way out of this tailspin of feuding bitterness and rage and spite and hate is through forgiveness in the blood of Christ. This is true for England, America, and Kenya, and all the nations of the earth. There will be blood. The only question is whose blood and will it be efficacious blood. The blood of Jesus is efficacious. It actually takes away sin and guilt. It actually allows you to lay down your arms, lay down your vengeance, and forgive. May Uju Anja, the people of Kenya, and all people find peace in the Cross of Christ.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Queen herself once said, &ldquo;History teaches us we&hellip; need saving from ourselves, from our recklessness or our greed. God sent into the world&hellip; neither a philosopher or a general&hellip; but a Saviour with the power to forgive.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of natural gas in </span><a href="http://dailywire.com/topic/europe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has increased </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/back-to-the-dark-ages-tucker-carlson-details-europes-self-induced-energy-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than tenfold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">amid the fallout from the </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/ukraine-russia-war"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian invasion of Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while Russia severed natural gas shipments through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline last week. According to a </span><a href="https://www.blick.ch/politik/gfroerlis-muessen-im-ernstfall-bibbern-heiz-suendern-droht-der-knast-id17851055.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Swiss news outlet Blick, the nation&rsquo;s Federal Law on National Economic Supply permits authorities to fine and imprison residents who consume too much gas if energy rationing becomes necessary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who fail to comply with the temperature mandates could receive sanctions between 30 and 3,000 Swiss francs, the equivalent of $31 and $3,090, Federal Department of Finance spokesman Markus Sp&ouml;rndli told the outlet. Those found intentionally violating the statute would receive up to three years in prison, and those found with negligent violations could be forced to pay 180 days&rsquo; worth of fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the temperature controls, residents will be unable to heat swimming pools, saunas, radiant heaters, or warm air tents, while hot water will not be allowed to reach temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius, or 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The member states of the Swiss Confederacy have until September 22 to voice concerns over the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, a heatwave that has </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/california-democrat-made-fun-of-texas-for-power-issues-now-hes-reminding-his-state-to-brace-for-blackouts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> power supplies in California led utility company Xcel Energy to </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/colorado-residents-find-thermostats-locked-at-78-degrees-due-to-energy-emergency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lock the thermostats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 22,000 people in Colorado at 78 degrees Fahrenheit in the interest of protecting grid capacity. The residents had previously opted into an incentive program that let the firm &ldquo;ease the strain on the electrical grid&rdquo; during the &ldquo;hottest summer days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Union has adopted the official </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2050-long-term-strategy_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of becoming &ldquo;a climate-neutral society&rdquo; by 2050 in accordance with the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement. Citing the failure of hydropower facilities amid drought conditions, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen likewise </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/european-union-intends-to-flatten-the-curve-for-electricity-use"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a &ldquo;mandatory target&rdquo; for reducing usage in the European Union, of which Switzerland is not a member.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If you look at the costs of electricity, there are peak demands. And this is what is expensive, because, in these peak demands, the expensive gas comes into the market,&rdquo; she commented on Wednesday. &ldquo;So what we have to do is to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">flatten the curve</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and avoid the peak demands. We will propose a mandatory target for reducing electricity use at peak hours.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flatten the curve. Where have we heard that language before?</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/fauci-jean-pierre-to-turn-over-emails-sent-to-social-media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/fauci-jean-pierre-to-turn-over-emails-sent-to-social-media</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fauci and Jean-Pierre ordered to turn over emails sent to social media companies:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Louisiana-based federal judge ruled that White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Dr. Anthony Fauci will have to turn over emails sent to social media companies on the subject of censorship and misinformation of online content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who are both Republicans, filed a lawsuit in May accusing President Joe Biden's administration of working in tandem with social media companies to suppress free speech, with specific allegations tied to information regarding elections and COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorneys general have been deliberating for months with the White House over which documents need to be shown in the lawsuit. On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Terry Doughty ruled the Biden administration must hand over Fauci's and Jean-Pierre's relevant emails within 21 days despite objections from the Justice Department, which cited executive privilege and presidential communications privilege.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crux of the lawsuit focuses on how social media companies handled claims about the origins of COVID-19, as well as how Big Tech platforms limited the reach of a New York Post article in November 2020 about information found on a laptop that once belonged to the president's son, Hunter Biden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their initial filing, Landry and Schmitt argue that "having threatened and cajoled social-media platforms for years to censor viewpoints and speakers disfavored by the Left, senior government officials in the Executive Branch have moved into a phase of open collusion with social-media platforms under the Orwellian guise of halting so-called 'disinformation,' 'misinformation,' and 'malinformation.'"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair of Republican attorneys general already obtained records earlier this month showing multiple federal agencies' officials contacted social media companies to develop content moderation strategies. One of the emails revealed the Department of Health and Human Services and Facebook personnel worked together to take down groups on the platform.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/american-federation-of-teachers-political-expenses-tax-form"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/american-federation-of-teachers-political-expenses-tax-form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal group asks IRS to audit AFT teachers union's political spending</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE &mdash; A conservative legal group is accusing the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest teachers union, of misreporting funds used on political causes to the IRS and is requesting an audit of the organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Wednesday letter to the IRS, a copy of which was provided exclusively to the Washington Examiner, the Landmark Legal Foundation requested the tax collection agency investigate the teachers union for allegedly failing to report its expenses related to political advocacy properly on its annual tax forms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union, led by President Randi Weingarten, has been a fixture of Democratic Party politics for years. Weingarten often appears with Democratic political candidates at campaign rallies, and the union has a long and well-documented history of supporting liberal causes, along with Democratic politicians and political action committees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a 501(c)5 tax-exempt organization, the AFT must annually submit Form 990 to the IRS. The form asks organizations if they have "engage[d] in direct or indirect political campaign activities on behalf of or in opposition to candidates for public office" with a yes or no answer box.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union checked "no" in response to the form's question from 2016 to 2019, according to 990 forms reviewed by the legal group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complaint to the IRS alleges that Weingarten and the AFT used funds from the "general treasury" to pay for various political activities, including campaigning on behalf of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, as well as sponsoring an "AFT Votes" bus tour during the 2020 campaign that "mobilized the public to vote for identified candidates for public office."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filed complaint comes just weeks after President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes funding for the IRS to hire an additional 87,000 agents, a fact that Landmark Legal noted in its complaint in urging the agency to investigate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the Washington Examiner reported that the AFT raked in a record $196 million in 2021 membership fees based on a report from Americans for Fair Treatment, a public sector union watchdog group.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/adults-aged-35-44-died-at-twice-the-expected-rate-last-summer-life-insurance-data-suggests_4711510.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/adults-aged-35-44-died-at-twice-the-expected-rate-last-summer-life-insurance-data-suggests_4711510.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death claims for working-age adults under group life insurance policies spiked well beyond expected levels last summer and fall, according to data from 20 of the top 21 life insurance companies in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death claims for adults aged 35 to 44 were 100 percent higher than expected in July, August, and September 2021, according to a report by the Society of Actuaries, which analyzed 2.3 million death claims submitted to life insurance firms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report looked at death claims filed under group life insurance policies during the 24 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from April 2020 to March 2022. The researchers used data from the three years before the pandemic to set a baseline for the expected deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While COVID-19 played some role in the majority of the excess deaths for adults over the age of 34 during the two pandemic years, the opposite was true for younger people. For people 34 and younger, the number of excess non-COVID deaths was higher than those related to COVID, the data show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the third quarter of last year, deaths in the 25-to-34 age bracket were 78 percent above the expected level and, for people aged 45 to 54, 80 percent higher than expected. Excess mortality was 53 percent above the baseline for adults aged 55 to 64.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One life insurance company stated that it recorded COVID-19 as the cause of death only when it could be determined to be the primary cause of death on a death certificate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also notes that white-collar workers had the highest number of excess deaths during the two years studied. The group, which includes accountants, lawyers, computer programmers, and most other jobs done in an office setting, had 23 percent more deaths than expected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sharp increase of deaths among working-age people was first brought to light by Scott Davison, CEO of the Indianapolis-based life insurance company OneAmerica, who said in a virtual press conference on Dec. 30, 2021, that his company and the life insurance industry as a whole was seeing a 40 percent increase in deaths among people ages 18 to 64.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden on Sept. 9, 2021, mandated COVID-19 vaccines for federal employees and health care workers in facilities certified by Medicare and Medicaid. The same day, the president tasked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with implementing a nationwide vaccine mandate on private businesses with 100 or more employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign to vaccinate the majority of the population against COVID-19 is the largest vaccination campaign in the history of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Aug. 31, about 90 percent of Americans 18 or older had gotten at least the first dose of one of the COVID-19 vaccines, and 77 percent had gotten both a first and a second dose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Robert Malone, a physician and research scientist credited with the invention of the mRNA technology for use in vaccines, says excess mortality must always be studied to determine whether a vaccine or medicine really is safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Excess mortality should be a signal, a trigger,&rdquo; he told The Epoch Times. &ldquo;When we see excess mortality like that&mdash;basically if you&rsquo;re running a clinical trial and you see this kind of excess mortality, you stop the trial. And you investigate the cause before you proceed. And if you&rsquo;re marketing a drug, generally, with this kind of data, you stop the distribution of the drug until you have sorted it out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malone mentioned what he calls the &ldquo;classic example&rdquo; of thalidomide, a morning sickness medication prescribed to a small number of pregnant women in the United States in the late 1950s and early &rsquo;60s that was effective in treating morning sickness, but caused severe deformities in their unborn children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drug maker had pressured the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug, but the FDA refused, based on the deformities that had been reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cholesterol medication is another example, he added, saying cardiologists were convinced in the 1990s that cholesterol was the &ldquo;bad actor&rdquo; and that heart disease numbers would drop if it could be brought down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So they came out with some really good drugs for dropping cholesterol, and they ran the trials,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it clearly showed that they were effective in dropping cholesterol in humans, to a remarkable level, very, very effective. And everything was on track for approval, at those doses. And then the all-cause mortality data started coming in.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And paradoxically, people were dying, but they weren&rsquo;t dying of heart attacks. Their heart attack death rate was better. They were committing suicide, because when you pull cholesterol out of the brain, you trigger depression.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malone was a professor of pathology at the University of California&ndash;Davis and at the University of Maryland, where he had a lab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of COVID-19, he said, the CDC and FDA have been in denial about what all-cause mortality data show, in particular on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), where the government has only considered deaths that occur within 2 to 3 weeks of vaccination, based on the belief that the mRNA doesn&rsquo;t stay in the body for longer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he says, studies clearly show that this isn&rsquo;t true and the mRNA stays in the body for at least 60 days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government is required to study all-cause mortality for any drug or vaccine, says Malone, usually for a period of at least one year following approval. But there&rsquo;s no indication, he says, that they&rsquo;ve done this for the COVID-19 vaccines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The FDA basically threw away the rulebook, and let Fauci do whatever he wanted to do,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enoch Burke, a school teacher in Ireland, was banned from his school over his refusal to use the pronoun &ldquo;they&rdquo; for a student, then arrested for returning Monday, according to the Irish news website RTE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School suspended Burke from teaching while he underwent a disciplinary process for refusing to use the preferred pronouns of a student who identifies as transgender, which he said would violate his Christian beliefs, and a court issued an injunction temporarily barring him from teaching, according to RTE. Burke returned to the school anyways, and he was arrested and taken to prison.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I am a teacher and I don&rsquo;t want to go to prison,&rdquo; Burke said, according to the New York Post. &ldquo;I want to be in my classroom today, that&rsquo;s where I was this morning when I was arrested &hellip; I love my school, with its motto Res Non Verba, &lsquo;Actions not words,&rsquo; but I am here today because I said I would not call a boy a girl.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was initially suspended Aug. 24, and the court order came down Friday after he continued attending school anyways, according to RTE. He defied the court order blocking him from teaching Monday and told the court that it would violate his conscience to obey it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burke said in court that he loves his students and the subjects he teaches and that he didn&rsquo;t want to go to prison, but he couldn&rsquo;t violate his conscience by participating in the child&rsquo;s gender transition process, according to RTE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;To be clear, this teacher was jailed for breaching a court order, not for &lsquo;misgendering&rsquo;. But that court order barring him from the school because he refused to use &lsquo;they&rsquo; for a male student, should never have been granted IMO,&rdquo; author and commentator on transgender issues Helen Joyce wrote. &ldquo;Sinister and absurd.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation&rsquo;s request for comment.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-inspectors-find-damage-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-buildings-housing-fresh-nuclear-fuel-radioactive-waste"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-inspectors-find-damage-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-buildings-housing-fresh-nuclear-fuel-radioactive-waste</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UN inspectors find damage to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia buildings housing 'fresh' nuclear fuel, radioactive waste</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Tuesday it found damage caused to buildings at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) that are housing "fresh" nuclear fuel and solid radioactive waste.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The team closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the ZNPP, in particular on 3 Sept. when the team was instructed to evacuate to the ground level of the Administrative Building," a report by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi to the United Nations Security Council said. "Moreover, the team observed damage at different locations caused by reported events with some of the damage being close to the reactor buildings."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grossi&rsquo;s report Tuesday is the first update the international community has received on Europe&rsquo;s largest nuclear power plant since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ZNPP has seen repeated damage caused by shelling that has hit the plant&rsquo;s power lines connecting it to Ukraine&rsquo;s electrical grid as well as its structural integrity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his report, Grossi detailed several events that have "significantly compromised" the plant&rsquo;s "Seven Pillars" &ndash; a standard at which the IAEA bases its security guidelines &ndash; since the ZNPP was first occupied in early March by Russian forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IAEA chief laid out a litany of concerns relating to damages inflicted on the plant&rsquo;s electrical system, harm caused to the Central Alarm Station and damage inflicted on a container where the radiation monitoring system is located.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IAEA report also "noted with concern that the shelling could have impacted safety related structures, systems and components, and could have caused safety significant impacts, loss of lives and personnel injuries."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of targeting the nuclear power plant, though the IAEA report did not clarify who is responsible for the attacks on the ZNPP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2022/09/06/ho-hum-another-47b-for-ukraine-covid-whatever-n494624"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2022/09/06/ho-hum-another-47b-for-ukraine-covid-whatever-n494624</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ho hum. Another $47B for Ukraine, COVID, whatever</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, what&rsquo;s a paltry fifty billion dollars between friends, right? That&rsquo;s roughly the amount of money that the Biden administration is asking Congress to approve in a short-term spending bill. The request is being described by the White House as &ldquo;technical assistance to Congress&rdquo; in the form of a continuing resolution. Biden&rsquo;s people would like to see this spending bill pass as a standalone measure before the debate over the big spending bill takes place. That needs to be done by September 30, barely five weeks ahead of the midterm elections. And where will this latest mountain of money be going? To Ukraine, of course. And also to fight COVID, which will apparently be an excuse that we use indefinitely from here on out. Oh, and monkeypox too, or whatever we&rsquo;re supposed to be calling it this week. There&rsquo;s also some money for natural disaster recovery in there, which should probably be handled by FEMA. (Government Executive)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Congress and the Biden administration are still hammering out a budget deal for the upcoming fiscal year, the Biden administration is asking for a short-term funding measure with specific funding, totaling $47.1 billion, to support Ukraine, respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and monkeypox spread as well as help areas impacted by natural disasters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House said on Friday that a continuing resolution will be needed as the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, however the administration is confident Congress will come to a bipartisan agreement. If no agreement is reached by the end of the fiscal year, then a government shutdown will begin just over a month from the midterm elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Today, as part of our prudent planning for the end of the fiscal year, we are providing technical assistance to Congress on a short-term CR,&rdquo; which &ldquo;provides guidance to lawmakers on funding and legislative adjustments that are necessary to avoid disruptions to a range of important public services,&rdquo; wrote Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, in a blog post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One part of the problem with this situation is that we have blown through so much magical money over the past couple of years, measured in the trillions and largely blamed on the pandemic, that people have likely become numb. At this point, $47.1 billion dollars probably sounds like &ldquo;no big deal.&rdquo; Some of us are old enough to remember when a billion dollars sounded like a lot of money.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should be asking the White House to explain precisely how much of this batch of money would be going to Ukraine. We have given more cash and other forms of aid to the Ukrainians than just about every other country combined. Where is all of this money going? How many of the weapons we have sent over there actually made it to the battlefield to fight the Russians and how many of them mysteriously disappeared? We don&rsquo;t know because we&rsquo;ve never been told and nobody seems to be keeping track of any of this. Even CNN is admitting that the White House is unable to track any of this. Before the invasion began and Zelensky was turned into some sort of superhero action figure, his government was regularly being investigated for corruption and a lot of arms trafficking took place in Ukraine. Shouldn&rsquo;t we have a better idea of what&rsquo;s going on?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the rest of the money is supposedly going to &ldquo;fight COVID.&rdquo; But how long will we be footing those bills? Not that many people seem to be lining up for booster shots and our businesses and schools are allegedly almost entirely open. Is &ldquo;fighting COVID&rdquo; going to be the new magical phrase every time the White House wants to pluck the next fifty billion dollars from the magical money tree in the Rose Garden? The money for natural disasters seems fine, provided it goes to where it&rsquo;s really needed. Of course, that&rsquo;s a pretty big assumption these days when we can apparently spend any amount of money domestically provided you work the phrase &ldquo;climate change&rdquo; into the title of the bill.</span></p>

<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Asking for Help After Texas Sends Over...100 Migrants to IL</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Chicago is asking for volunteers and donations for migrants who are being bused to Illinois from Texas as illegal border crossings continue to remain at an all-time high.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press reported the plea for help from the Windy City comes as only two buses arrived from Texas, totaling around 125 people who illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and were then processed and released by Border Patrol. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) "said the city had not yet heard from any Texas officials and urged Texas&rsquo; Republican governor, Greg Abbott, to collaborate on a more humane treatment of the immigrants."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott added Chicago as a destination migrants can opt to go to for free in addition to Washington, D.C. and New York City to relieve stress on Texas border towns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightfoot accused Abbott of treating the migrants like cargo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He tries to send human beings, not cargo, not freight, but human beings across the country to an uncertain destination. He is manufacturing a human crisis and it makes no sense to me."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to NewsNation Ali Bradley reporter, migrants who have taken Texas buses said they felt respected throughout the process.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it wouldn&rsquo;t be a Garrison newsbrief if we didn&rsquo;t talk about my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/05/frances-tiafoe-upsets-rafael-nadal-in-us-open-fourth-round/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/09/05/frances-tiafoe-upsets-rafael-nadal-in-us-open-fourth-round/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Frances Tiafoe upsets Rafael Nadal in US Open fourth round</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frances Tiafoe talked a big game and delivered a bigger one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greatness was predicted for Tiafoe when he broke onto the scene eight years ago with his speed and power. He finally showed that skill set that had everyone agog when he was 16. And then he broke down in tears after match point when he achieved Monday&rsquo;s milestone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the Round of 16 matchup, Tiafoe expressed confidence he could knock out Spanish legend Rafael Nadal and post the largest win of his as yet unfulfilled career.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-year-old American blasted through at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Labor Day before a manic, pro-Tiafoe crowd to upset Nadal with a blistering serve and forehand to make his first Open quarterfinals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiafoe, the 22nd seed, stunned No. 2 Nadal 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. It was the first time the 36-year-old Nadal lost to an American at a major in 17 years when he was beaten by James Blake.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, September 6th, 2022. Happy Tuesday everyone! I hope your weekends were filled with restfulness and bonding time with your loved ones&hellip; and you know what would be another good way to bond with family? Our conference!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you like Jesus &amp; beer? Then you and your family need to come to the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee, on October 6-8. The topic of this conference is Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. Satan is the father of lies, and the mother of those lies is a government that has rejected God. Christians haven&rsquo;t been reading their Bibles, so we as a society are more susceptible than ever to satan and his lies. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, and Pastor Toby Sumpter of the CrossPolitic Show, and more&hellip; AND, stuff for the kids too, like jumpy castles, and accidental infant baptisms! Sign up to attend with you and yours, or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bizzarro World: NY GOP Gov challenger within 4 points?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When unelected New York Governor Kathy Hochul recently told all 5.4 million registered Republicans in her state to move to Florida, I pointed to her statement as evidence that she is brimming with confidence that there is no possible way she could lose to a Republican in November. While that still may turn out to be the case, the picture is nowhere near as clear as it seemed to be a couple of months ago. In early August, a SurveyUSA poll had Hochul ahead of Republican Lee Zeldin by a whopping 52 to 28 margin. But this week, a Trafalgar poll dropped and they have Zeldin hot on Hochul&rsquo;s tail, with the Governor&rsquo;s lead dropping to a 47.8 to 43.4% advantage. That&rsquo;s still outside the poll&rsquo;s margin of error, but not by very much. So is this real? (NY Post)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin is closing in on incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul in New York&rsquo;s tightening gubernatorial race, a poll released Saturday found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey, conducted by the independent Trafalgar Group, found Hochul with just a 4 percent lead over the Long Island congressman &mdash; a significant narrowing in a race that has seen Hochul with a lead of up to 24 points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll of 1,091 likely general election voters, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday, pegged Hochul at 47.8% &mdash; and Zeldin, at 43.4%, nipping at the Democrat&rsquo;s heels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s still entirely possible that this is just a rather extreme outlier and Hochul&rsquo;s numbers will spring back in the next couple of surveys. After all, the RCP average still shows Hochul with a nearly 15-point lead even after this Trafalgar poll was factored in. But then again, all of those other polls were conducted well before her speech where she demanded that more than 5 million people leave the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, the SurveyUSA poll I mentioned above may have given Hochul a 24-point lead, but there were still 14 % undecided. If those undecided voters all started shifting in Zeldin&rsquo;s direction, the race could actually be tightening considerably. If you see two consecutive polls, with similar results, that could translate into actual momentum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m not even close to getting my hopes up yet because we&rsquo;ve been burned too many times before. New York hasn&rsquo;t elected a Republican governor since George Pataki&rsquo;s third victory in 2002. And even that race was very close, with Pataki benefitting from an unexpectedly strong showing for a third-party candidate who drained votes away from the Democrat. The generic ballot has only gotten worse for New York Republicans since then. There would need to have been a massive sea change in a very short period of time for these latest figures to be real.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I don&rsquo;t think we can say that it&rsquo;s flatly impossible. Crime in the state &ndash; particularly in New York City &ndash; has been out of control for a while now and the state is hemorrhaging residents. Hochul and her party have done nothing to fix the &ldquo;bail reform&rdquo; policies they instituted and a majority of New Yorkers see that as one of the leading drivers of increased crime rates. Taxes have continued to go up on a number of things, even as high prices make it harder for people to get by. Is it possible that the Democrats are finally losing support, even in the blue stronghold of New York City? Zeldin should do well in the upstate region, but he can&rsquo;t win unless he can gain some significant traction in the Big Apple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put a bookmark on this race and we&rsquo;ll come back to it in a few weeks. If we see one or two more surveys producing similar results, we could have an actual race on our hands. And the down-ballot races for both Congress and the state legislature might deliver some very unpleasant surprises for the Democrats if that turns out to be the case.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion pill providers seek to bend or break pro-life state laws</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To circumvent pro-life laws in many states, abortion activists, including those in the medical community, are pursuing questionable legal methods of delivering abortion drugs to women who are seeking the procedure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Times, Elizabeth Nash, who works for the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute said, "We&rsquo;re going to see these different approaches by organizations as they assess what the laws say and develop their rationale for how to provide care."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We just don&rsquo;t have a road map about how to provide medication abortion post-Roe, so it&rsquo;s all being created right now," Nash added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solutions to get around pro-life laws include prescribing medications that induce abortion past the 10-week limit set by the Food and Drug Administration. Another option is that physicians are providing telemedicine appointments to abortion seekers and not asking about their state of origin. In other instances, physicians are simply giving out abortion inducing medication to anyone who asks, regardless of whether they are pregnant or not, in a hope to saturate the market and disseminate the drugs en masse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Times reports, abortion via medication "typically involves two drugs: mifepristone, which blocks a hormone necessary for pregnancy development, followed 24 to 48 hours later by misoprostol, which causes contractions that expel pregnancy tissue."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medication-induced abortions made up over half of the abortions in the US by 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 Republican-led states, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas, had strong strong pro-life legislation go into effect right away with many other states, like Indiana, following suit. The current practices around the dissemination of medicine that induces abortion creates a legal grey area for many of these states as their legislation mostly focuses on abortion clinics and their providers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christie Pitney, a "midwife" who works for Europe based pro-abortion company Aid Access said preliminary prescription was the solution, calling it "advance provision," and that women should get the medication wherever they can and hold on to it. Pitney said getting medication that will kill an unborn child was like getting "medication for traveler&rsquo;s diarrhea."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Pitney, Aid Access has received 10,000 requests for the medication after the overturn of Roe.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stranded Tourist with Dead Electric Car Helped by West Virginia Coal Miners</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electric vehicle of an unfortunate Washington, DC, tourist ran out of battery in the middle of a remote West Virginia road on Friday. Thankfully, a few unlikely good Samaritans were nearby to rescue the stranded traveler.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wild sequence of events was recounted by Tucker County State Sen. Randy Smith (R) on Facebook, which occurred near a coal mine on Mettiki Coal access road U.S. 48, a few miles outside of Davis, West Virginia, according to WTRF.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Today at our mine off Corridor H an electric car from DC ran out of battery at the road entrance to the mine,&rdquo; Smith wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state senator noted that the vehicle was stranded in the middle of the haul road, meaning that workers had to act fast to not impede incoming traffic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a few coal miners came to assist, it was soon realized that the vehicle could not be moved by a tow truck since the bottom of the car was all plastic with nothing to hook onto.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With few options left, the coal miners worked with the driver to push the vehicle up the road to the mine where the traveler could recharge his car.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If you look closely you can see our coal stockpile and load out in the background,&rdquo; Smith noted as the five coal miners and driver are seen pushing the vehicle in a photo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While electric vehicles have recently symbolized an elitist shift away from natural energy resources such as coal, natural gas, and oil to renewable energy sources, that narrative was set aside on Friday as the coal miners were more than willing to help the unfortunate traveler.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith added that one of the good Samaritans even gifted the D.C. driver a &ldquo;Friend of Coal&rdquo; license plate to take home with him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50 Biden Administration Employees, 12 US Agencies Involved in Social Media Censorship Push: Documents</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50 officials in President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration across a dozen agencies have been involved with efforts to pressure </span><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-big-tech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies to crack down on alleged misinformation, according to documents released on Aug. 31.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior officials in the U.S. government, including White House lawyer Dana Remus, deputy assistant to the president Rob Flaherty, and onetime White House senior COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt, have been in touch with one or more major social media companies to try to get the companies to tighten rules on allegedly false and misleading information on COVID-19, and take action against users who violate the rules, the documents show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2021, for instance, after Biden said that Facebook was &ldquo;killing people&rdquo; by not combating misinformation effectively, an executive at Meta </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22273648-meta-and-hhs-messages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reached out to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, a Biden appointee, to say that government and Meta teams met after the remarks &ldquo;to better understand the scope of what the White House expects from us on misinformation going forward.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same executive later </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22273647-white-house-and-facebook-interactions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote to Murthy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saying, &ldquo;I wanted to make sure you saw the steps we took just this past week to adjust policies on what we are removing with respect to misinformation, as well as steps taken to further address the &lsquo;disinfo dozen,'&rdquo; including removing pages linked to the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House </span><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/biden-administration-pushes-social-media-companies-to-combat-covid-19-misinformation_3903450.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly pressured</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> social media companies to take action against a group officials dubbed the &ldquo;disinformation dozen,&rdquo; which a nonprofit claimed were producing the bulk of &ldquo;anti-vaccine misinformation&rdquo; on the platforms. Also in July 2021, </span><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/surgeon-general-facebooks-efforts-to-combat-alleged-covid-19-misinformation-is-not-enough_3906879.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murthy said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Facebook had not done enough to combat misinformation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Flaherty, director of digital strategy for the White House, told Slavitt and others in April 2021 that White House staff would be briefed by Twitter &ldquo;on vaccine misinfo,&rdquo; with the meeting including &ldquo;ways the White House (and our COVID experts) can partner in product work,&rdquo; according to one of the messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another exchange that year, a Department of Treasury official working on &ldquo;mis, dis, and mal-information&rdquo; </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22273723-state-department-emails"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told Meta workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the deputy treasury secretary wanted to talk about &ldquo;potential influence operations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a text in February 2021, meanwhile, U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly, wrote to another agency official that she was &ldquo;trying to get us in a place where Fed can work with platforms to better understand the mis/dis trends so relevant agencies can try to prebunk/debunk as useful.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documents were part of a preliminary production in </span><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/federal-judge-orders-biden-administration-to-cooperate-in-social-media-collusion-lawsuit_4595222.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">levied against the government by the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, </span><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/great-barrington-declaration-authors-join-lawsuit-against-alleged-government-big-tech-collusion_4640259.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">later joined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by experts maligned by federal officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If there was ever any doubt the federal government was behind censorship of Americans who dared to dissent from official Covid messaging, that doubt has been erased,&rdquo; Jenin Younes, a lawyer with the New Civil Liberties Alliance who is representing some of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement. &ldquo;The shocking extent of the government&rsquo;s involvement in silencing Americans, through coercing social-media companies, has now been revealed.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Begins Busing Illegal Immigrants to Chicago</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-texas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday said that </span><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-illegal-aliens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">illegal aliens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border are now being bused to Chicago in addition to New York City and Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott said his strategy to bus illegal immigrants from Texas to the Democrat-led </span><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-sanctuary-cities"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanctuary cities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes a strategic point about the impact of President Joe Biden&rsquo;s &ldquo;open border policies&rdquo; on American communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;President Biden&rsquo;s inaction at our southern border continues putting the lives of Texans&mdash;and Americans&mdash;at risk and is overwhelming our communities,&rdquo; the Republican governor said in a </span><a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-first-bus-of-migrants-arrives-in-chicago"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;To continue providing much-needed relief to our small, overrun border towns, Chicago will join fellow sanctuary cities Washington, D.C. and New York City as an additional drop-off location.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledging Chicago&rsquo;s sanctuary city policies, Abbott said Mayor Lori Lightfoot &ldquo;loves to tout&rdquo; that her city welcomes illegal immigrants as a matter of &ldquo;responsibility.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I look forward to seeing this responsibility in action as these migrants receive resources from a sanctuary city with the capacity to serve them,&rdquo; Abbott said.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Chicago Calls Busing Program &lsquo;Racist&rsquo;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chicago mayor&rsquo;s office confirmed that around 60 illegal aliens arrived at Union Square from Texas on Wednesday night and were being provided with essential services while they &ldquo;navigate the next steps of their journey.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As a city we are doing everything we can to ensure these immigrants and their families receive shelter, food, and most importantly protection,&rdquo; the spokesperson said in a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Ryan_Johnson/status/1565150452458700801?s=20&amp;t=j8T8jocuhhz66oV2jYC2pA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &ldquo;This is not new; Chicago welcomes hundreds of migrants every year to our city and provides much-needed assistance.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spokesperson also accused Abbott of having no &ldquo;shame or humanity&rdquo; and described the busing program as &ldquo;racist practices.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mayors of Washington and New York City, Muriel Bowser and Eric Adams, have also criticized the busing program, calling it a political stunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Abbott has said the illegal immigrants voluntarily chose to go to their cities where there is more capacity to serve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Texas governor first directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management in April to charter buses to transport illegal immigrants who claimed asylum when apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border to Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City was added as a second drop-off location in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, more than 8,900 illegal aliens have been bused out of Texas to those cities, providing &ldquo;much-needed relief to Texas&rsquo; overwhelmed border communities,&rdquo; according to Abbott&rsquo;s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwhelmed with the influx of illegal aliens arriving from Texas, Bowser has twice asked the Biden administration to deploy National Guard personnel to help her city cope. Both requests were denied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightfoot signed Chicago&rsquo;s &ldquo;Welcoming City Ordinance&rdquo; measure in February 2021 to strengthen the city&rsquo;s sanctuary policies, which prevented local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Chicago has been a welcoming city and a city of immigrants since its very founding, and proudly so,&rdquo; Lightfoot </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChicagoMayorsOffice/videos/2844688205845931"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott&rsquo;s office noted that under this policy Chicago doesn&rsquo;t deny city services to individuals based on their immigration status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;With its &lsquo;Welcoming City Ordinance&rsquo; making it a sanctuary city, Chicago will not deny city services to individuals based on their immigration status. The city also does not require local police to cooperate with federal immigration authorities,&rdquo; Abbott&rsquo;s office said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott </span><a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1565138872887115776?s=20&amp;t=nlPDsg2BJWFdfNEW5mmGqQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep busing illegal aliens to so-called sanctuary cities until the Biden administration &ldquo;does its job&rdquo; to secure the border.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon to Join California in Move to Ban Gas-Powered Vehicle Sales</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-oregon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has joined a list of more than a dozen states vowing to follow </span><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-california"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s lead in banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move comes as California urges residents to not charge their electric vehicles during a heatwave to avoid straining the electrical grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Oregon Department of Environmental Quality advisory committee is now in the process of creating what it calls &ldquo;Advanced Clean Cars II Rules,&rdquo; which will guide the state toward that new goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California announced on Aug. 24 that it would begin to phase out gas-powered vehicles beginning in 2026, when 35 percent of all passenger vehicles and light duty trucks sold in the state must be zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an anticipated increase of nearly 8 percent annually, the state has vowed that 100 percent of all vehicles sold in California will be ZEVs by 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon aims to follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The transportation sector accounts for more than 40 percent of Oregon&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions,&rdquo; the Oregon Department of Energy said in a statement. &ldquo;Moving to cleaner, alternative fuel transportation options, like zero-emission vehicles, can reduce those harmful Green House Gases (GHGs) and help Oregon reach its climate goals.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon had already been working toward a goal set by its legislature in 2019 to have 250,000 registered ZEVs in the state by 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of April, there were approximately 50,000 ZEVs on Oregon roads, falling well short of the pace to meet that goal in the first three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re committed to getting more electric vehicles [EVs] on Oregon&rsquo;s roads and 50,000 registered EVs is a major milestone,&rdquo; said Amanda Pietz, administrator of the Oregon Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Climate Office. &ldquo;EVs make up about 8 percent of new cars, trucks, and SUVs sold in Oregon, and we&rsquo;ll support that growing market through partnerships to build out EV charging stations along major roads and in Oregon&rsquo;s communities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state will also &ldquo;support&rdquo; that market by banning gas-powered vehicles and using taxpayer-funded subsidies to prime the pump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon offers as much as $7,500 in taxpayer-funded rebates on top of the federal tax credit of $7,500 toward the purchase of a ZEV. Utilities in the state are offering additional rebates of up to $1,500 for a vehicle purchase and up to $1,000 to install a residential home charger or workplace-commercial charging station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Go Electric Oregon website encourages buyers to &ldquo;stack&rdquo; government incentives to obtain more than $16,500 to use for the purchase of a ZEV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, taxpayers have already subsidized the purchase of electric vehicles (at an average cost of $66,000) to the tune of $55 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One 2018 estimate puts the average income of an electric vehicle driver at $150,000 compared to the U.S. average of $63,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, the Oregon Department of Transportation committed to spending $100 million in federal and state funds over the next five years to expand Oregon&rsquo;s EV charging infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transition to ZEVs seems to overlook increasing concern over their environmental impact and national security implications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making ZEV batteries requires the use of fossil fuels to process ore and extract minerals, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and graphite. They also require steel, aluminum, plastic, and other materials. The extraction and processing of these minerals are dominated by China and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bloomberg, China controls 80 percent of the market for EV batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push to convert to ZEVs will also create challenges to the electrical grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2018 analysis, energy economists at the University of Texas found that if California drivers were to go fully electric overnight, the state would need about 47 percent more electricity than it currently consumes. All the states that follow California&rsquo;s emission standards will face similar challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But California&rsquo;s electrical grid is already strained and Oregon&rsquo;s faces uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a heatwave looming, California&rsquo;s grid operator issued an alert on Aug. 31, urging residents to avoid using large appliances and charging electric vehicles between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. over the Labor Day weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Lowering electricity use during that time will ease strain on the system, and prevent more drastic measures, including rotating power outages,&rdquo; the alert reads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has supported removing or breaching the Lower Snake River Dams to protect fish populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon-free hydropower from dams makes up 45 percent of the electricity used in Oregon.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report: 20 MLB Teams &lsquo;Promote or Fund&rsquo; Groups that Perform Child Sex Change Operations</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine </span><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/08/the-mlbs-unseemly-support-for-youth-gender-transitions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviewed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the causes and organizations to which these teams are handing out millions of dollars in donations and found that many support sex-change surgery, hormone treatments, and other dangerous procedures for &ldquo;transitioning&rdquo; teens and pre-teens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Review</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/08/the-mlbs-unseemly-support-for-youth-gender-transitions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that almost every team in the league &ldquo;promote or fund groups that encourage or provide sex-change procedures and gender-transition hormone treatment for minors as young as 12. Other organizations promote &lsquo;social transitions&rsquo; &mdash; i.e., nonmedical changes in &lsquo;gender expression,&rsquo; including the adoption of new names, pronouns, and clothing &mdash; for children as young as three.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the support these teams are lending is organized under the rubric of the widespread LGBTQ &ldquo;Pride Nights&rdquo; that the league pushes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the yearly events in the stadiums, the teams also donate money to a number of advocacy groups &mdash; usually local groups, but often national groups, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Detroit Tigers, for instance, support the Ruth Ellis Center and Corktown Health in Detroit, the magazine noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the checkout page for tickets to the Pride Night game, the Tigers website offered &lsquo;a chance to support a local Pride organization of your choice,&rsquo; with a drop-down menu that included LGBT-focused clinics such as the Ruth Ellis Center and Corktown Health, both of which perform medical gender transitions on minors. On top of masculinizing and feminizing drugs, at least one &mdash; the Ruth Ellis Center &mdash; included irreversible &lsquo;gender affirming surgery&rsquo; in its suite of &lsquo;transition care for transgender youth&rsquo; options. Another charity promoted by the Tigers, the Trans Sistas of Color Project, was actively funding groups such as &lsquo;Trans Minors Rights,&rsquo; which &lsquo;advocates for empowering transgender youth to make their own decisions regarding puberty blockers&rsquo; &mdash; i.e., &lsquo;without requiring the consent of a parent.&rsquo; (The group&rsquo;s tagline: &lsquo;Unblock blockers.&rsquo;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine noted that the Tigers are only one example and that the MLB &ldquo;</span><a href="https://mktg.mlbstatic.com/dbacks/documents/y2020/pride_resource_guide.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pride Resource Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; promotes a long list of &ldquo;social justice&rdquo; groups that also push transgenderism on kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report found that five teams promoted groups that push dangerous surgeries on trans kids, including the Detroit Tigers, the Boston Red Sox, the Milwaukee Brewers, Tampa Bay Rays, and the Cleveland Guardians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four teams partner with organizations that provide counseling and referrals to youths for such medical procedures. That list includes the L.A. Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres, and the Oakland As.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And another five teams promote groups that offer guides and promotion of the transgender lifestyle, including the Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros, Arizona Diamondbacks, Philadelphia Phillies, and the Colorado Rockies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, six teams support groups that have lobbyists for the trans cause and otherwise advocate for the transgender lifestyle. Those teams include the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, the L.A. Angels, Minnesota Twins, St. Louis Cardinals, and the Washington Nationals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classic case of institutional capture by the Left,&rdquo; the magazine concluded. It is up to the fans to speak out and urge the league to reverse course on this outrageous advocacy.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without further adieu, let&rsquo;s get to the news&hellip; what&rsquo;s going on in California?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-environment/californians-asked-keep-ac-at-78-nix-electric-vehicle-charges-spare-grid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-environment/californians-asked-keep-ac-at-78-nix-electric-vehicle-charges-spare-grid</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Californians asked to keep AC at 78 and nix electric vehicle charges to spare grid</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California grid operators warned residents to prepare for voluntary energy cuts and other emergency measures, such as turning down the air conditioning and forgoing electric vehicle charges, as the state braces for a period of excessive heat expected to last through Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Independent System Operator said in a statement it is taking measures to bring &ldquo;all available resources&rdquo; online ahead of the heat wave, which is expected to be the longest and most severe high-heat period to hit the state so far this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An excessive heat warning is in effect through much of Southern California, with the National Weather Service warning of &ldquo;dangerously hot&rdquo; conditions that could climb as high as 115 degrees in some parts of the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, temperatures in Northern California are expected to be 10-18 degrees warmer than usual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This could include asking residents to set thermostats to 78 degrees or higher, avoid large appliance use and EV charging, and turn off unnecessary lights between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m, when the grid is the most stressed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowering power usage during that time will ease the strain on the grid, officials said, and prevent &ldquo;more drastic measures, including rotating power outages.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/fbi-employees-have-lost-confidence-in-christopher-wray-call-for-him-to-resign?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/fbi-employees-have-lost-confidence-in-christopher-wray-call-for-him-to-resign?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI employees have 'lost confidence' in Christopher Wray, call for him to resign</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel have lost confidence in Trump-nominated Director Christopher Wray and are calling for his resignation, a former agent has revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kurt Siuzdak, an ex-FBI agent who now works as a lawyer representing whistleblowers at the bureau, claimed that current agents are saying that Wray has lost control of the agency and that they do not see how he can continue in his position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm hearing from [FBI personnel] that they feel like the director has lost control of the bureau," Siuzdak told the Washington Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump nominated Wray in 2017, after firing then-director James Comey who was investigating his links to Russia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siuzdak left the FBI after nearly 25 years working as an agent last March, due to what he sees as politicized leaders who were not being held accountable, reported the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail report, FBI agents claimed in disclosures to Congress that Wray would be made aware of problems within the bureau but never attempted to solve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the reported problems that Wray allegedly ignored were agents being forced or coerced into signing false affidavits, claims of sexual harassment and stalking, and the fabrication of terrorism cases to elevate performance statistics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Siuzdak's allegations, the FBI said in a statement to the Washington Times, "The men and women of the FBI work hard every day to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. All employees are held to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct, and we expect them to focus on process, rigor, and objectivity in performance of their duties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Allegations of misconduct are taken seriously and referred to the Inspection Division or appropriate investigative body. In reality, the FBI is comprised of 37,000 employees who do it the right way on a daily basis to keep our nation safe by fighting violent crime, preventing terrorist attacks and defending America from espionage and cyber threats," the statement continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siuzdak's claims came soon after the resignation of Timothy Thibault, the FBI Assistant Special Agent in charge of the Hunter Biden laptop investigation, over accusations of political bias. Thibault reportedly retired from the bureau last Friday and was escorted out of the building.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2022/08/30/cnner-claims-gun-ownership-america-homeland-security-problem"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2022/08/30/cnner-claims-gun-ownership-america-homeland-security-problem</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNNer Claims Gun Ownership in America a 'Homeland Security Problem'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an appearance on CNN&rsquo;s Don Lemon Tonight on Monday, CNN national security Analyst Juliette Kayyem made the Orwellian suggestion that guns in America were a &ldquo;homeland security problem.&rdquo; But the craziness didn&rsquo;t stop there as she claimed &ldquo;responsible gun ownership&rdquo; means you don&rsquo;t own semi-automatic rifles and that gun manufacturers have made mass shootings &ldquo;very sexy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayyem&rsquo;s Orwellian declaration against guns came in her opening comments when she was speaking with Lemon about a shooting at a grocery store in Oregon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.mrctv.org/videos/101973/101973-480p.mp4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://cdn.mrctv.org/videos/101973/101973-480p.mp4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:00-1:57</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In either a brief moment of lucidity or playing Devil&rsquo;s advocate, Lemon made the logical point that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;people's actions&rdquo; that are &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for mass shootings. &ldquo;There are people who have access to guns who don't go off and just shoot people and rob stores,&rdquo; he noted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding Lemon&rsquo;s point, Kayyem opined about how the narrative for pushing gun control is changing and suggested those against taking away guns are for police getting murdered and were &ldquo;often&rdquo; the victims of mass shootings:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they were nearing the end of the segment, Lemon chided those who &ldquo;think they're a badass when they're holding a gun,&rdquo; and Kayyem took the opportunity to lash out at the National Rifle Association.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring the fact that the NRA funds and organizes gun safety and training courses, she accused the organization of abandoning advocacy for &ldquo;responsible gun ownership.&rdquo; She then explained that her definition of &ldquo;responsible gun ownership&rdquo; meant people who &ldquo;don't have weaponry &hellip; unnecessary in civilian society.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, speaking of guns&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-lawmakers-credit-card-companies-gun-sales"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-lawmakers-credit-card-companies-gun-sales</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York lawmakers ask Mastercard and American Express to flag gun store purchases</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York lawmakers believe they have found a way to reduce firearm trafficking and mass shootings. Approximately 50 legislators penned a letter to Mastercard and American Express, requesting that the companies flag purchases made at gun stores.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic state Senator Zellnor Myrie shared the letter with Gothamist and spoke about leading the effort. Myrie explained that he believed the public would agree with the lawmakers' request.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While credit card companies do not track specific items purchased, they do use merchant category codes designated by retailer type. Mastercard's quick reference booklet notes that purchases made at a gun store fall under the "miscellaneous" or "durable goods" retailer codes. Those two MCCs also include vendors of gas lighting fixtures, musical instruments, fireworks, party supplies, and luggage, to name a few.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter drafted to Mastercard and American Express requested that gun retailers have their own merchant category code instead of sharing it with other non-firearm-related vendors. This modification would allow credit card companies &ndash; and, consequently, the government &ndash; to closely track firearm and ammunition purchases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York legislators argued that plenty of other retailers have a unique code, such as pawn shops, aquariums, and antique shops. They also noted that credit card companies have already been required to report suspicious activity to law enforcement since 1970.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myrie argued that a one-of-a-kind code would help authorities to spot suspicious purchasing activity, which could prevent mass shootings and gun trafficking. Further, he stated that law-abiding citizens have "absolutely nothing to worry about."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trudeau Liberals to spend $100 million on 2SLGBTQI+ Action Plan so Canadians can be their 'authentic selves'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth Marci Ien unveiled the Liberals' federal "2SLGBTQI+ Action Plan."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan, put in place to build a "more inclusive future," is set to cost $100 million over the next five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Liberals, the plan will "prioritize and sustain 2SLGBTQI+ community action by supporting 2SLGBTQI+ community organizations in advocating for and serving the communities they represent."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals of the plan include advancing 2SLGBTQI+ rights both in Canada and around the world via laws such as the recently passed criminalization of conversion therapy, as well as using data and investing in awareness campaigns to "improve understanding of 2SLGBTQI+ communities and issues."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of the action plan was accounted for in the 2022 federal budget, and on Sunday, Trudeau unveiled exactly where the money would be going.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bulk of the funding, $75 million, was set aside for 2SLGBTQI+ community organizations, with prioritization given to those "experiencing additional marginalization," such as "Black, racialized, and Indigenous 2SLGBTQI+ communities," as well as those "with disabilities, seniors, youth, official language minority communities, and those living in rural communities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defence Minister Anita Anand applauded the plan, saying it would "help us build a Canada where everyone is free and welcome to be their true, authentic selves."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government justified their choice to use the acronym 2SLGBTQI+ noting that is it "more inclusive and places the experiences of Indigenous 2SLGBTQI+ communities at the foreground as the first 2SLGBTQI+ peoples in North America."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal Immigrant Children Being Placed With Strangers, Says Whistleblower</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unaccompanied children who cross the U.S. border alone are potentially being placed in dangerous situations due to the lax vetting of the adults they&rsquo;re being handed off to, says a whistleblower who works with a company that transports the minors around the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unaccompanied child who crossed the U.S. border illegally without a parent or guardian is processed by Border Patrol and then transferred to Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS&rsquo;s Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for placing the child with a vetted sponsor in the United States&mdash;usually a parent or relative, but not always, says the whistleblower.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no proper vetting right now saying, &lsquo;Hey, these kids are really related to this person.&rsquo; No. That could be a child offender, sex offender wanting to take one of these kids into their homes&mdash;and the government will let it happen,&rdquo; the whistleblower told Savanah Hernandez, a Texas-based reporter who runs a podcast called Rapid Fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whistleblower alleges in the interview that he works for MVM, Inc., a Virginia-based private security company that contracts with the federal government to escort children throughout the United States from border regions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He estimates the company is currently transporting between 2,000 and 5,000 children every week from Texas to sponsors around the country. They often travel at night and to small, regional airports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HHS started releasing data on the number of unaccompanied minors it was housing in March 2021 as the volume overwhelmed border facilities, which aren&rsquo;t designed as shelters for children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By April last year more than 20,000 children were in HHS custody at one time, waiting for sponsor placement&mdash;at a taxpayer cost of at least $60 million per week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Rogan Says &lsquo;Vote Republican,&rsquo; Cites &lsquo;Serious Errors&rsquo; During Pandemic</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Garrison, is this really a sports story? Well I&rsquo;m counting it, because not only does Joe Rogan cover the UFC, but this was also his episode with Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcast king Joe Rogan urged his 11 million listeners to &ldquo;vote Republican&rdquo; to address the &ldquo;serious errors&rdquo; made by government officials during the coronavirus panic starting in 2020 during Saturday&rsquo;s show.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study finds around one-third of Americans regularly get their news from Facebook</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around a third of Americans regularly get their news from Facebook, according to the latest study from Pew Research Center, whose surveys aim to better understand the current media landscape in the U.S. In the updated report, Pew Research found that around half of U.S. adults, or 53%, said they &ldquo;often&rdquo; or &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo; use social media to get their news. This is spread out across a number of sites, but Facebook is at the top of the list. Now I&rsquo;m sure a lot of you already have your alarm bells going off at this point, but don&rsquo;t worry, it gets worse in a bit!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that 36% of U.S. adults said they &ldquo;regularly&rdquo; access Facebook to get news. This is a significantly larger percentage than almost any other social media platform, with the exception of YouTube, which is used regularly for news by 23% of U.S. adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, the percentages are much smaller. Even Trump&rsquo;s preferred platform for communication (well, until recently), Twitter, is only used regularly for news by 15% of U.S. adults, Pew found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only around one in 10 Americans or fewer said they regularly got their news from other social media platforms, including Instagram (11%), Reddit (6%), Snapchat (4%), LinkedIn (4%), TikTok (3%), WhatsApp (3%), Tumblr (1%) and Twitch (1%).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew notes that the lower percentages for using these sites as a source of news also has to do with the fact that fewer Americans report using these sites at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew additionally examined the demographic makeup of those who use social media for news, and found that white adults make up the majority of the regular news users for sites like Facebook and Reddit. Both Black and Hispanic adults, meanwhile, made up around a quarter of Instagram&rsquo;s regular users (22% and 27%, respectively.) Facebook was found to also skew toward women (63% versus 35%) when it came to regularly using it getting the news, while Reddit skews toward men (67% versus 29%).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, remember how I said it gets worse? Well take a listen to Facebook CEO and lizard-human hybrid, Mark Zuckerberg, on the Joe Rogan Podcast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BN3PIGLDscQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Mark Zuckerberg Answers to Facebook's Moderation of Controversial Content&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/BN3PIGLDscQ&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Mark Zuckerberg Answers to Facebook's Moderation of Controversial Content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Play 5:02-6:42</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&rsquo;t know about you, but my b.s. Alarm bells are ringing&hellip; Mr. Zuckerberg, you definitely do know the percentage off the top of your head. That&rsquo;s a bold-face-lie. Also, did you catch the part where Mr. Zuckerberg openly admitted the part where the FBI is in the business of fact checking now? That&rsquo;s scary&hellip; who fact checks the FBI? Who holds the FBI accountable when they&rsquo;ve gone rogue? You have to believe that either the FBI is so inept, or they&rsquo;re lying, and tried to effect the outcome of the election. Who else comes to mind with fact-checking? The World Heath Organization? The CDC? Who&rsquo;s fact checking them? Let&rsquo;s dive into some statistics on the election results&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/26/2020-election-outcome-would-differ-with-hunter-biden-laptop-coverage-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/08/26/2020-election-outcome-would-differ-with-hunter-biden-laptop-coverage-poll/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">79% say &lsquo;truthful&rsquo; coverage of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop would have changed 2020 election</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly four of five Americans who&rsquo;ve been following the Hunter Biden laptop scandal believe that &ldquo;truthful&rdquo; coverage would have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, according to a new poll.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar percentage also said they&rsquo;re convinced that information on the computer is real, with just 11% saying they thought it was &ldquo;created by Russia,&rdquo; according to the survey conducted by the New Jersey-based Technometrica Institute of Policy and Politics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And an even higher number &mdash; 81% &mdash; said US Attorney General Merrick Garland should appoint a special counsel to investigate matters related to the first son&rsquo;s infamous laptop, the existence of which was exclusively revealed by The Post in October 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll results, published Wednesday, are based on responses from 437 adults who said they were following the laptop story &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; closely when they were surveyed online earlier this month, according to the TIPP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the subject of the 2020 election, 79% overall said it was &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; likely that &ldquo;a truthful interpretation of the laptop&rdquo; would have resulted in the reelection of former President Donald Trump instead of the election of President Biden.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Republicans, 57% were strongly convinced Trump would have won, compared to 48% of independents and just 44% of Democrats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But majorities in both parties &mdash; 89% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats &mdash; said they believed the laptop &ldquo;is real,&rdquo; along with 74% of independents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder, how the electoral map would have looked with these findings in mind? Hmmmm&hellip; I&rsquo;ll leave that to you guys&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/30/us-military-ammunition-arming-ukraine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/30/us-military-ammunition-arming-ukraine/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Military Running Low On Ammo After Arming Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pentagon officials are concerned that U.S. ammunition stocks donated to Ukraine have severely depleted U.S. stocks, weakening U.S. readiness in the event of a conflict, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has drawn much of the over $13 billion in weapons systems and accompanying ammunition the U.S. has provided to Ukraine from existing arsenals, according to the WSJ. While the Department of Defense has declined to disclose the number of ammunition rounds in storage at the beginning of 2022, before the war in Ukraine began, it has taken few steps to replenish depleting stocks, sparking worries that the U.S. may not have the ammunition it needs for its own protection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The level of 155mm combat rounds, fired by the howitzer weapons system, in U.S. stockpiles has become &ldquo;uncomfortably low,&rdquo; a Pentagon official told the WSJ. The U.S. has sent 806,000 rounds of the 100-pound explosives to Ukraine as of Aug. 24.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is not at the level we would like to go into combat,&rdquo; the defense official told the WSJ. U.S.-supplied howitzers have seen extended use from Ukrainian forces since entering the conflict in late May, Fox News reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the U.S. provided smaller 105mm ammunition to feed Ukraine&rsquo;s howitzers in order to spare 155mm rounds for the U.S., according to the WSJ. The U.S. military most recently employed howitzers in a strike on Iran-backed targets in Syria on Aug. 24.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depleting U.S. arsenals &ldquo;was forewarned, including from industry leaders to the Pentagon. And it was easily fixable,&rdquo; Mackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Army plans to conduct a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo; into the &ldquo;ammunitions industrial base&rdquo; to determine the best way to support Ukraine while retaining necessary supplies for the U.S., Army officials told the WSJ. It has requested an additional $500 million yearly for upgrades to ammunition factories and increasing the threshold on existing production contracts, but has not signed any new contracts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials also said that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley authorized monthly reviews of U.S. weapons stores to monitor readiness. However, defense industry leaders said the administration has not clearly communicated the changes in production requirements brought on by U.S. assistance to Ukraine and has not expanded production capacity to make up for the additional munitions needed to replenish stocks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has requested a record $773 billion defense budget for 2023. While additional funding can alleviate part of the problem, ongoing supply chain issues can make the months or years-long manufacturing process take even longer, according to the WSJ.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/oregon-wind-farm-sees-blades-bolts-fly-off-as-failures-mount-report?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/oregon-wind-farm-sees-blades-bolts-fly-off-as-failures-mount-report?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon wind farm sees blades, bolts fly off as failures mount: report</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new report has revealed the unreliability of a major Oregon wind farm, discovered after a blade from a windmill detached and flew across the field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Oregonian, in January, a delivery driver found some broken, industrial-size bolts on the ground near one of Portland General Electric&rsquo;s towering wind turbines but did not know who to tell and used it as a paperweight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Feb 1 at 2:11 am, one of the turbine&rsquo;s 11-story tall blades flew the full length of a football field and plowed a 4-feet deep furrow in a wheat field. The heavy-duty bolts that kept the blade attached to the tower scattered like shrapnel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PGE&rsquo;s flagship wind facility, which opened 15 years ago to expand green energy technology in Oregon and nationally had other warning signs as well according to the outlet but it wasn&rsquo;t until the blade breakdown that the company took action at Biglow Canyon, one of Oregon&rsquo;s largest wind farms, and shut down all 217 turbines for testing, keeping some out of service for four months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though industry groups insist that wind farms are very safe and major malfunctions are rare, wind farms are growing older and components are aging.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investigation by The Oregonian found a massive set of maintenance problems and equipment failures that are reducing electricity generation at Biglow Canyon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the outlet, "there is no effective national, state or county reporting requirement or database tracking safety or operational incidents at wind farms, and only 13 of the largest of Oregon&rsquo;s 48 wind farms are regulated by the state, numbers that include multiple phases of some projects."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, PGE launched an investigation into the blade throw but has asked the Oregon Department of Energy to keep those confidential until the end of the year because of the possibility of litigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To eliminate all its greenhouse emissions, PGE would need to massively increase its renewable energy resources and manage them effectively for decades. However, wind power is heavily dependent on federal subsidies, and according to experts consulted by The Oregonian, "those subsidies are structured in a way that incentivizes operators to skimp on maintenance for older equipment that is no longer eligible."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, it&rsquo;s time for the topic that I love&hellip; sports! Washington Commanders RB Brian Robinson Shot During Attempted Robbery In D.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one is immune from crime in America&rsquo;s cities these days, and this weekend residents of Washington D.C. were especially reminded of that when Washington Commanders running back Brian Robinson, 23, was shot multiple times during an attempted robbery on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the NFL&rsquo;s Mike Garafolo, Robinson was rushed to the hospital by emergency responders after the violent attack, reporting that &ldquo;#Commanders RB Brian Robinson is in stable condition after being shot as the victim in an attempted robbery, sources say.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the news regarding the situation broke, the Washington Commanders followed up by issuing an immediate statement to alert fans that Robinson was alive and safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional information regarding details from the shooting came later from NFL Network Insider, Tom Pelissero, who was one of the first people to share the information online after receiving a statement from a D.C. Police spokesperson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report from NBC Washington, Robinson got into an altercation with several suspects shortly after midnight Sunday as they attempted to steal his Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat. It was that altercation which led to the shooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late Sunday night, Commanders Head Coach Ron Rivera met with Robinson and later posted to Twitter that Robinson was in &ldquo;good spirits&rdquo; to ease everyone&rsquo;s anxiety regarding his current health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robinson is now but one of the many innocent D.C. bystanders who have been victims of violent crime this year alone. According to D.C. Police crime statistics, there have been 126 people killed via homicide just in 2022, which is a 12 percent increase from this time last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violent crimes and cases regarding burglary have also risen five percent since 2021, with robberies up 20 percent, and car thefts up three percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well Praise God this one ended with Robinson walking away.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/san-francisco-businesses-threaten-to-stop-paying-taxes-until-city-officials-fix-homeless-problem?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/san-francisco-businesses-threaten-to-stop-paying-taxes-until-city-officials-fix-homeless-problem?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco businesses threaten to stop paying taxes until city officials fix homeless problem</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business owners of San Francisco are demanding the city solve the growing mental health, crime, and drug problems exacerbated by the high rate of homelessness in the area, threatening to stop paying taxes if the issues continue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Castro Merchants Association, named after the city's Castro District, sent a letter to San Francisco city officials saying group members who own businesses in the area plan to stop paying taxes if the city doesn't do more to address the problems, reported KTVU.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter, the organization complained of homeless people who "regularly experience psychotic episodes," vandalize storefronts, and harass business owners, employees, residents and tourists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our community is struggling to recover from lost business revenue, from burglaries and never-ending vandalism/graffiti (often committed by unhoused persons) and we implore you to take action," stated the letter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Every day we wake up and have to help people on the street. We have to clean up feces on the street. We have to clear our people from doorways, so we can open our businesses. It's not fair," said Terrance Alan, co-president of the association, and owner of Flore Dispensary and Cafe Flore to KTVU. "At this point it's a failure of the system to help them."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The association requested that the city reserve 35 beds in homeless shelters for people in the Castro district, in addition to devising a plan for offering services to people who decline help and keeping monthly records of how many people have been offered services and shelter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Sometimes they do get violent," said Deen Nasher, manager of Castro Smoke Shop. "The city does need to take care of these people, find a place for them to stay and help businesses. When we call, [the police] come 30-40 minutes later."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Karraker, the other co-president of the association, said that if the association&rsquo;s demands are not met, they may ask store owners to stop paying taxes and other city fees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco&rsquo;s Department of Public Health (DPH) responded to the group, acknowledging the association's concerns and citing state policies that make their demands difficult to meet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco businesses have seen a large increase in burglaries and vandalism since 2019, prompting The Castro Merchants Association to begin documenting incidents. The association noted over 90 incidents totaling more than $170,000 in repair costs since 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/google-revises-search-results-to-better-facilitate-abortions?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/google-revises-search-results-to-better-facilitate-abortions?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google revises search results to better facilitate abortions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google will now filter search results to indicate which locations identified as providing pregnancy services specifically provide abortions. The search engine had come under fire from pro-abortion activists for including results for pregnancy centers that do not provide abortions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this change, crisis pregnancy centers were also included in search results for abortion clinics. These are centers that help women who are unexpectedly pregnant keep their babies. Crisis pregnancy centers are in the business of facilitating birth, motherhood, and families, and encourage women to keep their babies, often providing help not just to the expecting mother, but for her partner as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a user searches for abortion facilities, those facilities that specifically provide abortions will be labeled as "provides abortions." If the search engine doesn't know whether or not a facility provides pregnancy termination, that result will be labeled "might not provide abortions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google search results had not been differentiating between pregnancy centers that seek to help women, and those that offer pregnancy termination. As a result, some women seeking abortions were directed to services that would not provide them. This happened, according to Bloomberg, about a quarter of the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, after the Supreme Court ruling overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that federally legalized abortion, lawmakers pressed Google to make this change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their ask to Google came after a study from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which "found that 11 percent of the results for a search for an 'abortion clinic near me' or 'abortion pill' in some states were for centers that oppose abortion," Reuters reported. This study was done in states that sought to make abortion illegal once the right to legislate on the matter was returned to the states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Countering Digital Hate also put together a list of the top ten accounts that have specifically sought to counter the genital mutilation of children, and called those users hateful for demanding that healthy children not be sterilized or otherwise mutilated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those lawmakers who demanded Google change their search results to facilitate ease of finding access to abortions directed their letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. In the view of these lawmakers, crisis pregnancy centers that encourage the continuance, instead of the termination, of a pregnancy are "fake clinics." They cite the Center for Countering Digital Hate, saying that the ads for crisis pregnancy centers are "misleading."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Google&rsquo;s updates," TechCrunch reports, "around searches for abortion come as a group of more than 600 Google employees is pressing the company to expand worker health benefits, divest itself of some political ties and bolster user privacy in light of the Supreme Court decision to strip federal abortion rights."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://fee.org/articles/cnn-medical-analyst-says-masking-stunted-her-toddler-s-language-development-and-taught-her-an-important-lesson-about-tradeoffs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://fee.org/articles/cnn-medical-analyst-says-masking-stunted-her-toddler-s-language-development-and-taught-her-an-important-lesson-about-tradeoffs/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen Says Masking Stunted Her Toddler&rsquo;s Language Development</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the pandemic, Wen was in what I&rsquo;ll call the &ldquo;pro-mandate&rdquo; camp.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2021, she excoriated governors who rescinded or failed to pass mask mandates in their states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are not out of the woods. We haven&rsquo;t reached the end of the pandemic,&rdquo; Wen said in a pro-mask CNN piece. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s counterproductive and truly infuriating these governors are treating this as if the pandemic is over. It&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later that year, she went so far as to argue that unvaccinated people shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to leave their homes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1436372898651033601"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1436372898651033601</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year later, Wen&rsquo;s views have changed. In a recent Washington Post article, she explained why she&rsquo;ll no longer be masking her children and how she shifted away from &ldquo;being extremely cautious&rdquo; with Covid protocols.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I accept the risk that my kids will probably contract covid-19 this school year, just as they could contract the flu, respiratory syncytial virus and other contagious diseases,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;As for most Americans, covid in our family will almost certainly be mild; and, like most Americans, we&rsquo;ve made the decision that following precautions strict enough to prevent the highly contagious BA.5 will be very challenging.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wen&rsquo;s observations are not wrong. The new variants are less deadly, and this is particularly true for children, which has always been the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year ago, when Wen was still advocating strict mandates, we pointed out that the CDC&rsquo;s own data showed small children were at far greater risk of dying from the flu, drowning, vehicle collisions, cancer, and other things than Covid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data, for whatever reason, apparently did little to persuade Wen in 2021, however. What does appear to have changed her mind is that her child appears to have suffered from the mandates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Masking has harmed our son&rsquo;s language development,&rdquo; she bluntly asserts in the article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Wen no doubt knows a great deal about public health, just like Anthony Fauci and Rochelle P. Walensky. But even Fauci and Walensky, I suspect, would concede that it&rsquo;s Wen who knows what&rsquo;s better for her child.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be stressed that it&rsquo;s not just that Wen wants what&rsquo;s best for her child. It&rsquo;s that she actually knows what&rsquo;s best for her child because she has infinitely more knowledge about her child than any distant bureaucrat or meddling politician could ever possess.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel Prize-winning economist F.A. Hayek detailed this &ldquo;local knowledge&rdquo; concept in his work exploring &ldquo;the knowledge problem,&rdquo; and he showed why central planners seeking to engineer society through force are capable of producing little beyond &ldquo;planned chaos.&rdquo; This is why it&rsquo;s so important that freedom of decision-making is left to those who have the most local knowledge and can most accurately assess the risks and rewards of any given action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that Wen, to her credit, appears to have learned something throughout the tragedy of the Covid pandemic, as have so many others.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Monday, August 29th, 2022. I hope you had an excellent weekend of rest, and worship with you and yours, so without further adieu, here&rsquo;s what you may have missed over the weekend!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-booster-shots-omicron-fda"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-booster-shots-omicron-fda</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA to authorize new COVID booster shots for Omicron before trials on humans, will instead rely on testing on mice</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to authorize new COVID-19 booster shots this week. The booster shots will be released months before trials on humans are completed, according to a new report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New COVID-19 booster shots that target the latest Omicron variant will be approved by the FDA this week, the Wall Street Journal reported. The new booster shot will be "bivalent" &ndash; which means it can target the original COVID-19 strain and the Omicron BA.5 subvariant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The booster shot will likely be available to Americans despite not having been tested on humans. Instead, the FDA will rely on testing on mice, data from current COVID-19 vaccines, and earlier iterations of boosters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal noted, "The Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize new COVID-19 booster shots this week without a staple of its normal decision-making process: data from a study showing whether the shots were safe and worked in humans."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA Commissioner Robert Califf issued a statement on Twitter regarding how the government agency will likely make a decision in granting emergency use authorization (EUA) for booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"FDA will rely on the totality of the available evidence in making a decision, including: Clinical trial data from other bivalent mRNA COVID-19 boosters RWE from current COVID-19 vaccines administered to millions of people, non-clinical data for the bivalent BA.4/5 vaccines, bivalent and multivalent vaccines are very common and modifying a vaccine to include different virus strains often does not require a change in other ingredients," Califf said on Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha expected the boosters to be available by "early to mid-September."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Oregon, tragic news, as 3 Dead After Shooter Opens Fire at Oregon Shopping Center</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle opened fire in a shopping center in Bend, Oregon, on Sunday evening, killing at least two people, authorities have confirmed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An individual who is believed to be the shooter was also found dead at the scene, police said, taking the death toll to three.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers and emergency medics responded to multiple 911 calls of shots being fired at the Forum Shopping Center in Brend, which is approximately 160 miles southeast of Portland, Oregon, at about 7:04 p.m.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials believe the shooter, who was only identified as a male, entered from a residential area behind the shopping center and moved through the parking lot while shooting rounds from an AR-15-style rifle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When officers arrived at the grocery store, police believe shots were still being fired, Krantz said. Officers found the suspected shooter dead inside the store.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation into the shooting is still ongoing, Krantz said, and multiple agencies are involved including the FBI.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/gov-glenn-youngkin-vows-stop-ridiculous-state-ban-gas-vehicles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/gov-glenn-youngkin-vows-stop-ridiculous-state-ban-gas-vehicles</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh look! A governor with some brains! Take note Newsome &amp; Inslee, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vows to stop 'ridiculous' state ban on gas vehicles</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is working to dismantle Virginia's push toward electric vehicles, calling the move "ridiculous" in a Sunday statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia's former governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, signed legislation in 2021 tying the state's emissions policies to the California Air Resources Board. The board has imposed a regimen to eliminate the sale of gas and diesel vehicles by 2035, forcing Virginia to do the same thanks to the 2021 law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In an effort to turn Virginia into California, liberal politicians who previously ran our government sold Virginia out by subjecting Virginia drivers to California vehicle laws," Youngkin wrote in a statement on Twitter. "Now, under that pact, Virginians will be forced to adopt the California law that prohibits the sale of gas and diesel-fueled vehicles."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am already at work to prevent this ridiculous edict from being forced on Virginians. California&rsquo;s out of touch laws have no place in our Commonwealth," he continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin already has support for the move from the Republican-held House of Delegates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"House Republicans will advance legislation in 2023 to put Virginians back in charge of Virginia&rsquo;s auto emission standards and its vehicle marketplace. Virginia is not, and should not be, California," House Speaker Todd Gilbert said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam and his fellow Democrats passed the legislation when the party held full control of the Virginia government last year.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2022/08/28/taliban-conducting-door-to-door-raids-to-confiscate-guns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2022/08/28/taliban-conducting-door-to-door-raids-to-confiscate-guns/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Afghanistan&rsquo;s Taliban conducted door-to-door raids of homes in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Thursday in part to search for and confiscate weapons, including firearms, deemed &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; by the terror group, which seized control of Afghanistan&rsquo;s government in August 2021, the Kabul-based Khaama Press News Agency reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raids took place on the morning of August 25 in Mazar-e-Sharif, which is the capital of Afghanistan&rsquo;s Balkh province, Khaama Press reported citing unnamed sources. The news agency said Taliban spokesman Asif Waziri, who serves Balkh&rsquo;s &ldquo;office of the chief of police&rdquo; confirmed the raids in the northern capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Taliban forces are conducting door-to-door searches in an effort to combat ISIS, obtain state weapons and collect undocumented guns, as well as track down suspected criminals,&rdquo; the Taliban spokesman added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waziri referenced the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which is an international jihadist terror group present in Afghanistan in the form of an offshoot called ISIS-Khorasan Province (ISIS-K). ISIS-K claimed responsibility for a deadly suicide bombing at Kabul&rsquo;s Hamid Karzai International Airport on August 26, 2021, that killed 13 U.S. servicemembers and hundreds of Afghans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attack took place as the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden oversaw a chaotic withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan after the Taliban seized control of Kabul, the nation&rsquo;s seat of government, on August 15, 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taliban had previously ruled Kabul from 1996 to 2001 before Washington launched a nearly 20-year-long War in Afghanistan in late 2001 that ousted the Sunni Islam-based terror group from the capital and replaced it with a U.S.-backed Afghan government administration. In a reversal of the action almost two decades later, the Taliban reconquered Kabul last summer and have since reestablished sharia, or Islamic law, as the basis of Afghanistan&rsquo;s legal system.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Afghanistan, Brace Yourselves: We Might Need to Send Troops Back to Afghanistan</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a question of &ldquo;if,&rdquo; but &ldquo;when&rdquo; we redeploy troops to Afghanistan again amid rising terrorism concerns. This security situation wasn&rsquo;t an item that caught us off-guard. It didn&rsquo;t sneak up on us&mdash;it&rsquo;s just another consequence of Joe Biden&rsquo;s destructive policies. For all his time in DC, it&rsquo;s still amazing that he remains one of the worst foreign policy minds in American politics. The Delaware liberal has been wrong on every significant American foreign policy effort for the past 40 years, and this Afghanistan pickle is no different.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Fox News Sunday, retired Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. admitted that going back to Afghanistan, the graveyard of empires, was only a matter of time, given the increased activities of radical Islamic terrorists. McKenzie was the last commander of US-NATO forces in Afghanistan before our shambolic withdrawal. The Council of Foreign Relations had a detailed memorandum about the rising terror threat and how, unsurprisingly, the Taliban being allies of groups like al-Qaeda, have given their terror pals a lifeline to conduct their global campaign of jihad. The nation&rsquo;s third-world dynamics and failing state status also serve as a magnet for terror groups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genderal McKenzie Jr. was asked:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Do you think troops will have to be sent back to Afghanistan?&rdquo;&nbsp; He responded: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a difficult question&hellip;the threat is growing in Afghanistan, and it's merely a matter of time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/libs-of-tiktok-locked-out-of-twitter-again"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/libs-of-tiktok-locked-out-of-twitter-again</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh look, censorship is back! Libs of TikTok Locked Out of Twitter &ndash; Again</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter reportedly blocked the popular Libs of TikTok account on Saturday, keeping its owner from posting or logging in over alleged violations of the social media platform&rsquo;s guidelines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libs of TikTok has become a prevalent Twitter account over its posts that share examples of far-left videos from TikTok, including topics like LGBT activism, critical race theory, and public education issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Babylon CEO Seth Dillon shared a screenshot of the &ldquo;hateful conduct&rdquo; message the Libs of TikTok account claimed to have received.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hi Libs of TikTok, your account, @libsoftiktok has been locked for violating the Twitter rules,&rdquo; the message read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease,&rdquo; the message added. &ldquo;Please note that repeated violations may lead to a permanent suspension of your account. Proceed to Twitter now to fix the issue with your account.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message did not mention the particular post or posts that led to the locked-out account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the account&rsquo;s last messages before being locked out was posted on Thursday. The post included audio that claimed that the Children&rsquo;s National Hospital performed &ldquo;gender-affirming&rdquo; hysterectomies on minors, including those 16 years old and younger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s not the first time the popular account has been targeted in recent weeks. Libs of TikTok was permanently suspended from Facebook just one week earlier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we gotta wrap up today&rsquo;s newsbrief with my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2022/08/28/watch-aaron-rodgers-says-nfl-stooges-threatened-players-their-jobs-vaccines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2022/08/28/watch-aaron-rodgers-says-nfl-stooges-threatened-players-their-jobs-vaccines/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Bay Packers&rsquo; quarterback, Aaron Rodgers is at it again! Aaron Rodgers Says NFL &lsquo;Stooges&rsquo; Threatened Players with Their Jobs over Vaccines</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another revelation by Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers in his interview with Joe Rogan revealed how the NFL threatened players by holding their jobs hostage unless they got vaccinated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the August 27 Joe Rogan podcast in which Rodgers admitted that he purposefully misled the media on his vaccination status, Rodgers also blasted the NFL for its efforts to force players to take the jab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers slammed the NFL for &ldquo;virtue signaling&rdquo; over the vax and added that the league sent out &ldquo;stooges&rdquo; to force compliance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1563713875421315075"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1563713875421315075</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:05- </span><strong>LANGUAGE WARNING</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers said that the teams were bullied to force compliance and were told that they would have to forfeit games if they had a certain number of players and staffers out with positive COVID results. The league began telling teams of the forfeit rule in July of 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers added that the NFL told players that they would also sacrifice their pay for any forfeited games as another way to force compliance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ya know, Aaron Rodgers has annoyed me in the past, but I gotta give him props here for having a spine&hellip; he and Novak Djokovic, who by the way, isn&rsquo;t allowed to play at the U.S. Open this year because of his vaccination status. This after he JUST WON Wimbledon&hellip; Oh interestingly enough&hellip; Moderna, is a sponsor at the U.S. Open this year&hellip; Coincidence? I&rsquo;ll let you decide.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Texas trigger law doesn&rsquo;t change who can seek an abortion in the state, but it further criminalizes abortion by threatening physicians who perform the procedure with life in prison and a $100,000 fine.&nbsp;</span></p>

The classification of the syndrome has gone through several revisions within the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.</span></p>

Homosexuality was once considered a disability or psychological disorder, but that was actually the first step towards acceptance. Calling sin a disorder or sickness is often a way to downplay personal culpability and guilt and a way to garner compassion and sympathy. Pedophilia is currenlty being pedaled like this &ndash; sorry &ldquo;minor attracted persons.&rdquo; The same thing with alcoholism, but the Bible calls it idolatrous drunkenness. You worship the false god of the bottle. As is a lot of addiction language. Porn addiction is really idolatrous lust. You worship sexual perversion.&nbsp;</span></p>

Naming is cosmic. The first battle is over the dictionary. Who gets to define what words mean? This is why the pronouns matter. This is why we should continue to resist calling dudes making vows &ldquo;marriage.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t a marriage, any more than a dude in a dress is a woman.&nbsp;</span></p>

While Durant could always make another heel turn, all parties left that meeting at least expecting this to be a long-term marriage, albeit one with plenty to work through.</span></p>
<p><strong style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</strong></p>

But after this meeting the Nets expect Durant to fulfil the four-year, $198 million extension he signed last August that kicks in this upcoming season.</span></p>
<p><strong style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</strong></p>

It should also be noted that he went from inking a deal without a no-trade clause or trade kicker a year ago to requesting a trade in June, from wanting his GM and coach fired two weeks ago to supposedly buying in now.</span></p>

But after testing the market and finding nothing to approximate the all-time great, the Lakers held onto him and reached the Finals that following season, with Bryant winning MVP</span></p>

Meanwhile, more left-wing lawmakers like Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a full cancellation of student debt, Forbes previously reported.</span></p>

Data AI reported that the Truth Social platform has been downloaded approximately 3 million times since its launch.</span></p>

However, despite the major increase in downloads, the app is still dwarfed by social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.</span></p>

Truth Social saw approximately 2 million downloads in the first two weeks after its launch on February 21, 2022, but due to technical issues including a long wait time to access the site, the app&rsquo;s download rate quickly fell off. Downloads increased in late April when users on waiting lists to access the app were approved to join the platform.</span></p>

He's gone. The host of "Reliable Sources" was given the ax amid CNN's front office shake-up and reorganization of the news outlet's coverage, which has been pilloried as pro-Democratic Party propaganda. The new management at CNN wants to return to the days when CNN was more straight news, less drama, and not the subject of attacks over media bias for peddling explicit Democratic National Committee talking points.</span></p>

Toobin had emerged from the wilderness after The New Yorker fired him in 2020 following a humiliating incident where he exposed himself to the magazine's staff during a Zoom call. When Stelter was given the boot, people asked if Don Lemon, another insufferable fixture at the network, would be next. That could be in the cards, as a source is spilling the names of who's next on the butcher's bill. Yes, Don Lemon is on there:</span></p>

At the end of the day, while I know gutting CNN of their liberal cancers would be optimal, it's also a business. So, I could see this going either way regarding these potential firings. The new top brass could get rid of these folks and tread water for 2024, hoping their recent relaunch doesn't implode. Or they do a 180-degree turn, keep the Trump-hating hosts and contributors, and make a boatload of cash again.</span></p>

<p><strong style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</strong></p>

Utah&rsquo;s Republican lawmakers created the commission in a law passed earlier this year as a fallback plan to be implemented in case of an injunction against the law.</span></p>

<p><strong style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</strong></p>

Similar cases are underway in states such as Idaho, West Virginia and Indiana.</span></p>
<p><strong style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</strong></p>

He&rsquo;s insisting that there is some higher moral principle guiding his corruption. He is allowed to cheer on whatever corruption it takes to keep Trump out of office. He is above the law. He knows what is best for this country. This is a great example of what Doug Wilson has said before, which is that whenever people deny the existence of God, they are always interested in the job opening. Sam Harris is famous for his atheism, but he is not actually interested in a godless society. Here he is insisting that sometimes you have to step in pull all the levers of power that you can in order to prevent Trump from taking office.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, a federal judge initially blocked the law, commonly called the "Heartbeat Bill," because the U.S. Supreme Court had previously upheld the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.</span></p>

Wade, Georgia officials asked the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to reverse the district court decision, and a federal appeals judge ruled the law could take effect. The move officials prompted a group of pro-abortion doctors and advocates to file a lawsuit in Fulton County Superior Court.</span></p>

They highlight how destructive the transgender medical agenda is for children and how illogical transgender activists are.</span></p>
<p><strong style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</strong></p>

The hospital boasts that it regularly sees transgender children as young as 2 or 3 years old, when they meet with a psychologist who pushes them down the road of social gender transitioning. Concerned parents are told that beginning an irreversible process based on the word of a 2-year-old is just being &ldquo;supportive.&rdquo;</span></p>

That is not clear. In fact, it's hard even to imagine what that means. But we do apparently have metrics for when they are around 2 or 3. According to the hospital, a child refusing to get a haircut or playing with &ldquo;opposite gender&rdquo; toys can only mean that the child is transgender and must begin the gender transition process.</span></p>

If gender is an entirely social construct, then the idea of gendered toys is also a social construct. So, if the idea that only girls play with dolls (for example) is an outdated social construct, how does a boy playing with a doll prove that he is actually a girl and should begin the transition process?</span></p>

Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s Center for Gender Surgery is &ldquo;the first center of its kind in the U.S. in a major pediatric hospital setting,&rdquo; as it boasts on its website. It is operating on the logic that children can choose their gender because they know they are the wrong gender before they are even born.</span></p>

The focus is to avoid offending any &ldquo;ethnic, social, or professional groups and minimize harm to trade, travel, tourism, or animals.&rdquo; Monkeypox is at the top of the agenda to receive a new name. Two clades (variants) of the disease have already been given new names.</span></p>

Using Roman numerals instead of geographic areas, the Congo Basin variant is now Clade one or 1 and the West Africa clade is Clade two or II. This is to avoid stigmatization. Is all of this political correctness run amok? It looks like it. Who are they afraid of offending? Monkeys? Africans from the Congo or West Africa? Other diseases are named using geographic locations and they aren&rsquo;t being renamed. It&rsquo;s like the coronavirus that came from Wuhan, China. No one was supposed to call it the Wuhan virus because it might offend Communist Chinese leaders.</span></p>

The world&rsquo;s population has managed to live with that name since then. It was a commonsense name at the time &ndash; research monkeys in Denmark were observed to have a pox-like disease. Monkeys are not thought to be the animal reservoir. Now that it is spreading globally and health experts are beginning to panic, calling it a health emergency, suddenly the virus needs a new name. The WHO declared the disease an international emergency in July. The U.S. declared its epidemic a national emergency this month. Before that, back in May, Sleepy Joe was pushing the panic button and telling Americans that &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; should be concerned about monkeypox.</span></p>

The WHO is now reporting that it held an open forum to discuss a name change for the disease after a group of 30 scientists from Africa warned of an &ldquo;urgent need&rdquo; to change the name. It has a stigmatizing potential, they said. The virus has been reported in several other African countries and abroad. The Western outbreak began in May in the U.K., Portugal, and Spain. It has spread to the U.S., Canada, France, and Germany. Scientists are concerned about racist connotations and also stigma for the LGBTQ community. There have also been attacks on and poisoning of monkeys.</span></p>

Outside of Africa, 98% of cases are men who have sex with men. There is a limited global supply of vaccines. Health officials are rushing to stop monkeypox from becoming entrenched as a new disease. There&rsquo;s been a lot of tippy-toeing around that fact out of fear of offending gay men. It isn&rsquo;t exclusively gay men, it&rsquo;s also bisexual men who have sex with women. Anyone can get it. Even children can get monkeypox from skin-to-skin contact. It is, however, stoppable. Scientists know how it is spread and how to stop it.</span></p>

There&rsquo;s a shortage. The longer the virus hangs around and spreads, the more likely it produces variants, like what happened during the coronavirus pandemic. It gets more contagious. The Biden administration continues to prove how inept it is in dealing with emergencies. Where are the public service announcements targeting the communities most at risk? Biden seems to be asleep at the wheel once again.</span></p>

Factors include the lack of staffing at nursing/rehab facilities that would normally receive patients needing that level of care. That is creating a backlog of patients in the emergency department, impacting Harborview&rsquo;s ability to receive additional non-critical patients."</span></p>

The election is seen as a barometer of how the Biden administration and their leadership has performed since taking office, and so far, the pressure is definitely on.</span></p>

As such, they've announced "steps we're taking ahead of the US midterms to protect civic conversation on Twitter."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As they've done in international elections, Twitter is now "activating enforcement" of their "Civic Integrity Policy for the 2022 US midterms." Twitter states that their Civic Integrity Policy "covers the most common types of harmful misleading information about elections and civic events," which include: false claims about how and where to vote, voter intimidation, and "misleading claims intended to undermine public confidence in an election," which includes "false information about the outcome of the election."</span></p>

Twitter believed reports coming out of the Biden campaign, and other sources, that claimed the information had been obtained through hacking, a disallowable practice, or was "Russian disinformation."</span></p>

"We know that COVID 19 is here to stay," she added in comments during a briefing with reporters.</span></p>

"Based on the latest ... data, it's around 95% of the population," Massetti said, "And so it really makes the most sense to not differentiate," since many people have some protection against severe disease.</span></p>

The guidance eliminates the strategy known as "test-to-stay" &ndash; a schedule of testing for people that were exposed to the coronavirus but not up to date with their vaccinations &ndash; that allowed them to continue in-person learning, so long as they continued to test negative and showed no symptoms.</span></p>

Jacob Ruppert, owner of the club announced that DiMaggio, had accepted the club&rsquo;s offer, understood to call for a salary of $15,000, and an increase of pay of $6,500 over last tear&rsquo;s pay to the youthful slugger.</span></p>

Born to Italian Sicilian immigrants in California, he is widely considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time, and had a 56-game hitting streak (May 15 &ndash; July 16, 1941), a record that still stands.</span></p>

It didn&rsquo;t go well&hellip; The union was troubled from the start by DiMaggio's jealousy and controlling attitude; he was also physically abusive. A violent fight between the couple occurred immediately after the skirt-blowing scene in The Seven Year Itch that was filmed on September 14, 1954, in front of Manhattan's Trans-Lux 52nd Street Theater. Then 20th Century Fox's East Coast correspondent Bill Kobrin told the Palm Springs Desert Sun that it was director Billy Wilder's idea to turn the shoot into a media circus. The couple then had a "yelling battle" in the theater lobby.[49] After returning from New York City to Hollywood in October 1954, Monroe filed for divorce from DiMaggio after only nine months of marriage.</span></p>

Just weeks later, on July 28, the prestigious school's College Democrats chapter revealed it ousted Cocchiarella from the club "in late October 2021, following campus-wide allegations of sexual assault." Those allegations emerged publicly in a string of December 2021 Reddit posts, which accused Cocchiarella of using "his Twitter notoriety and left-wing credentials to position himself as an ally. Then, once people let their guards down, he rapes them."</span></p>

But Dr. Lee Miringoff says it's a delicate balancing act when her opponent Lee Zeldin is accusing her of not being tough enough on crime. Hochul's critics say she is once again putting the needs of the criminal ahead of the needs of the victim, while those who approve of the change say it gives the prison population a better chance at reintegrating into society.</span></p>
