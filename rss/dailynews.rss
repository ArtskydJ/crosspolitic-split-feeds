   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, March 22nd, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hi Contrast Hymn Books</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">If you don&rsquo;t teach your kids the Lord&rsquo;s songs, the world will teach them its songs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The brand-new Hi-Contrast Hymn Book is designed to help you teach your children the most beloved songs of the Christian faith.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Its captivating illustrations will create special moments of truth, goodness, and beauty in your home every day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a copy for your family, go to</span><a href="http://www.hicontrasthymnbooks.com/FLF"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.hicontrasthymnbooks.com/FLF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s www. &ldquo;H&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo;</span><a href="http://contrasthymnbooks.com/FLF"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">contrasthymnbooks.com/FLF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now to the news&hellip; First in world news&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-sign-economic-deal-latest-demonstration-friendship-limits"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-sign-economic-deal-latest-demonstration-friendship-limits</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping sign economic deal in latest demonstration of 'friendship without limits'</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an agreement to expand their economic ties during a bilateral meeting in Moscow on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Xi is in Moscow for a multiday series of meetings with his Russian counterpart, aimed at demonstrating the two countries' new "friendship without limits." Xi and Putin emphasized the importance of jointly safeguarding their countries' energy security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Putin touted plans for a gas pipeline from Siberia to China ahead of the meeting, saying the agreement was all-but finalized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We were just discussing a good project, the new Power of Siberia 2 pipeline via Mongolia. Practically all the parameters of that agreement have been finalized," Putin told Xi at the beginning of the meeting, according to the Financial Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Beijing has grown increasingly friendly with Moscow over the past year as Putin's invasion of Ukraine left the country largely ostracized on the world stage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Xi's visit comes just days after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest for war crimes committed in Ukraine. Nevertheless, the pair called each other "dear friend" when they first shook hands on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Putin alleged during Monday's meeting that the Western world is conspiring to stifle Russia and China by "persistently working to split the common Eurasian space into a network of &lsquo;exclusive clubs&rsquo; and military blocs that would serve to contain our countries&rsquo; development."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The exact details of Russia and China's Tuesday economic agreement have yet to be released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Over to Paris&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/macrons-government-faces-moment-of-truth-over-pension-reform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/macrons-government-faces-moment-of-truth-over-pension-reform</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Protesters set rubbish on fire as French govt barely survives no-confidence vote</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Protesters set piles of rubbish on fire in central Paris on Monday after President Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s government narrowly survived a no-confidence motion in parliament on Monday over a deeply unpopular pension reform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The failure of the no-confidence vote will be a relief to Macron. Had it succeeded, it would have sunk his government and killed the legislation, which is set to raise the retirement age by two years to 64.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But the relief proved short-lived.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In some of Paris&rsquo; most prestigious avenues, firefighters scrambled to put out burning rubbish piles left uncollected for days due to strikes as protesters played cat-and-mouse with police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Earlier on Thursday, a Reuters reporter saw police fire tear gas and briefly charge at protesters after the no-confidence vote barely fell short of enough votes to pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Unions and opposition parties said they would step up protests to try and force a u-turn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The vote on the tripartisan, no-confidence motion was closer than expected. Some 278 MPs backed it, just nine short of the 287 needed for it to succeed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As soon as the failure of the no-confidence vote was announced, lawmakers from the hard left&nbsp; (LFI, France Unbowed) shouted &ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; at Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and brandished placards that read: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet in the streets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the southwestern city of Bordeaux, about 200-300 people, mostly youngsters, gathered against the reform and chanted: &ldquo;Macron, resign!&rdquo; A couple of trash bins were lit on fire as the crowd chanted: &ldquo;This will blow up.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Over the past three nights, clashes over the pension reform, in Paris and throughout the country, have been reminiscent of the Yellow Vest protests that erupted in late 2018 over high fuel prices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A ninth nationwide day of strikes and protests is scheduled on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Nothing undermines the mobilization of workers,&rdquo; the hardline CGT union said after the vote, calling on workers to step up industrial action and &ldquo;participate massively in rolling strikes and demonstrations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Opposition parties will also challenge the bill in the Constitutional Council, which could decide to strike down some or all of it &ndash; if it considers it breaches the constitution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A second motion of no confidence, tabled by the far-right National Rally (RN), also failed, after it gathered only 94 votes. Other opposition parties said they would not vote for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Borne should go. She said Macron should call a referendum on the reform but was unlikely to do so. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s deaf to what the French people want,&rdquo; she told reporters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2023/03/20/this-is-insane-mexican-government-seizes-assets-of-american-company-n2620887"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2023/03/20/this-is-insane-mexican-government-seizes-assets-of-american-company-n2620887</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>'This Is Insane': Mexican Military Just Seized Assets of an American Company</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Over the weekend, the Mexican military seized a number of assets belonging to American company Vulcan Materials.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The seizure of a US company's marine terminal in Mexico has drawn criticism from a US senator and risks sparking more tension between the two nations amid spats over energy and security," Bloomberg reports. "US construction firm Vulcan Materials alleges that armed forces, including from the Mexican government, launched a takeover of its facility in the country's southeast on Tuesday. The company says a federal judge in Mexico has ordered a stay on any government effort to confiscate the property."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The move prompted national security experts to sound the alarm, calling the situation "insane."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe is also weighing in, noting President Joe Biden's continued weakness on the world stage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Last week, Mexican President Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador lashed out after Republicans called for additional tools to use military force against Mexican cartels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/february-home-sales-spike.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/february-home-sales-spike.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Home sales spike 14.5% in February as the median price drops for the first time in over a decade</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sales of previously owned homes rose 14.5% in February compared with January, according to a seasonally adjusted count by the National Association of Realtors. That put sales at an annualized rate of 4.58 million units.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It was the first monthly gain in 12 months and the largest increase since July 2020, just after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sales were, however, 22.6% lower than they were in February of last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">These sales counts are based on closings, so the contracts were likely signed at the end of December and throughout January, when mortgage rates had fallen sharply. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan hovered in the low 6% range throughout January after reaching a high of 7% last fall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The relative drop caused a jump in sales of newly built homes, before rates jumped back toward 7% in February. They now stand at 6.67%, according to Mortgage News Daily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Conscious of changing mortgage rates, home buyers are taking advantage of any rate declines,&rdquo; said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, in a release. &ldquo;Moreover, we&rsquo;re seeing stronger sales gains in areas where home prices are decreasing and the local economies are adding jobs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Higher mortgage rates have been cooling home prices since last summer, and for the first time in a record 131 consecutive months &mdash; nearly 11 years &mdash; prices were lower on a year-over-year comparison. The median price of an existing home sold in February was $363,000, a 0.2% decline from February 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That lower median price could be a sign that homes on the more affordable end of the market are selling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sales might have been even higher were it not for what is still very low supply. There were just 980,000 homes for sale at the end of February, according to the Realtors, flat compared with January. At the current sales pace, that represents a 2.6-month supply. A balanced market between buyer and seller is considered a 4- to 6-month supply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Inventory levels are still at historic lows,&rdquo; Yun added. &ldquo;Consequently, multiple offers are returning on a good number of properties.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This could start to heat prices again, but with mortgage rates now higher than they were in January it will be harder for some buyers to compete.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">All-cash sales accounted for 28% of transactions in February, down from 29% in January but up from 25% in February 2022. Individual investors returned, making up 18% of buyers, up from 16% in January but down from 19% in February 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">When looking at sales at different price points, they were all down in the range of 20% from February last year, with sales down the most in the top, million-dollar-plus segment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/politics/idaho-firing-squad-bill/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/politics/idaho-firing-squad-bill/index.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Idaho lawmakers approve bill that would allow execution by firing squad</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Idaho lawmakers approved a bill Monday that would allow execution by firing squad, according to the legislature&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">State Rep. Bruce D. Skaug confirmed the move in a statement to CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;H186 has now passed the Idaho Senate and House with a veto proof majority,&rdquo; Skaug wrote in an email to CNN. &ldquo;Upon signature of the Governor, the state may now more likely carry out justice, as determined by our judicial system, against those who have committed first degree murder.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A total of 24 officials voted for the bill, while 11 voted against it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Bill 186 will move to Republican Gov. Brad Little&rsquo;s desk next.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The bill stipulates that firing squads will be used only if the state cannot obtain the drugs needed for lethal injections. Several states have struggled to source the drugs required for lethal injection, causing them to pause executions and triggering lawsuits from inmates who argue the injections are inhumane.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Additionally, the bill permits Idaho to use firing squads if lethal injections are deemed unconstitutional by a court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A fiscal note tied to the bill explains that refurbishing the Department of Correction to meet &ldquo;safety and execution requirements for the firing squad&rdquo; will cost around $750,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">If the bill is signed into law, Idaho will follow South Carolina, which approved the usage of firing squads in March 2022. Three other states permit firing squads, according to the Death Penalty Information Center: Mississippi, Utah and Oklahoma.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A firing squad was last used in the US in 2010 to execute convicted murderer Ronnie Lee Gardner in Utah.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trump indictment could land as early as Monday, sending law enforcement scrambling</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement officials are meeting at NYPD headquarters in lower Manhattan on Monday afternoon to plan for a possible indictment of former President Donald Trump on charges stemming from payments to a porn star, a person involved in the planning told POLITICO.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An indictment by a grand jury is expected late Monday or Wednesday, according to three people involved in the deliberations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A court spokesperson said there&rsquo;s nothing to report since no charges have been filed. Spokespeople for the Secret Service and District Attorney&rsquo;s Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The NYPD&rsquo;s state of readiness remains a constant at all times, for all contingencies,&rdquo; an NYPD spokesperson said. &ldquo;Our communications and coordination with our partners in government and in law enforcement are fundamental tenets of our commitment to public safety.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Robert J. Costello, who once advised former Trump lawyer Michael D. Cohen, is scheduled to testify before the grand jury Monday afternoon. Cohen has said he will be a rebuttal witness to Costello, who may question Cohen&rsquo;s credibility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the sealed indictment is delivered to the judge, the DA&rsquo;s office would discuss Trump&rsquo;s surrender with his counsel, according to a court official who, like the others, was granted anonymity to discuss internal planning procedures. If Trump were to not surrender, a warrant would be issued for his arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether Trump would be handcuffed is a decision that would be made by the district attorney, the court official said. He would be finger printed and a mug shot would be taken, though he is not expected to be &ldquo;perp-walked&rdquo; or paraded before the public in handcuffs, the official said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, a 17-story Art Deco building that sits just northwest of the Brooklyn Bridge, was surrounded by over a dozen news vans Monday morning. Security was heightened as police officers and court officers set up barricades outside the courthouse. There was no sign of protesters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Monday he has not met with Bragg on the situation, but is prepared for any contingencies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the New York Young Republicans planned for peaceful protests, more sinister messages were posted on conservative chat sites. On the site patriots.win, once TheDonald.win &mdash; a site which lawmakers said played a significant role in organizing January 6th &mdash; users called for a &ldquo;nationwide strike&rdquo; and for &ldquo;all patriots&rdquo; to &ldquo;bring society to a halt.&rdquo; The arrest of Donald Trump and calls to protest was the top post section in the chat site on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leading Republican elected official in the state said he did not expect large, pro-Trump protests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get the same crazy couple dozen people and that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the Republican official, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about internal party dynamics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll probably more counter protestors than protestors,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden vetoes bill banning woke funds for Americans' retirement accounts</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden issued his first veto as president on Monday in a sign of what's to be expected with the Republican-majority Congress. Biden is seeking to kill a GOP measure that would ban the federal government from considering the environmental impacts or lawsuits when making investment decisions for retirement plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure, which was vetoed by Biden, ended a Biden administration rule allowing federal managers of retirement plans to consider factors such as climate change, social impacts, or pending lawsuits when making investment choices, a move that undid a Trump-era ban on the practice, The Hill reported</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments believe that money is allocated based on leftist causes rather than returns for retirees. Author James Lindsay, a vocal critic of ESG, told The Post Millennial, "ESG is a scam against America and a first-rate national security threat, and Biden is in on it. ESG uses your retirement money to do Woke and Sustainability activism that hurts America and everyday Americans."</span></p>

<p><strong>Minnesota's "woman of the year" is a man</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of course &ldquo;she&rdquo; is.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the risk of being accused of &ldquo;stochastic terrorism,&rdquo; I am compelled to state the obvious: it is not the case that every woman in the State of Minnesota is less worthy than the natal male Leigh Finke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USA Today begs to differ. Every woman in my state is less worthy of national recognition for excellence in womanhood than Finke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;She&rdquo; looks like a dude in a dress, and that is because &ldquo;she&rdquo; is a dude in a dress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet we are to believe that a man cosplaying as a woman is the most praiseworthy woman in the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finke must be one impressive &ldquo;woman,&rdquo; since &ldquo;she&rdquo; rose from being just a guy to the most impactful woman in my state is less than 6 years. It&rsquo;s the same path that transgender athletes take so often: a mediocre man becomes an exceptional woman, not through hard work, diligence, accomplishment, or anything similar. They do it by pretending to be a woman, and the rest of society applauds them and plays along.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>American Children Are Dying at Highest Rate in 50 Years</strong><strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortality rates among American children and adolescents rose by almost 20 percent in just two years, with non-COVID injuries being a top reason for increased deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2019 and 2020, all-cause mortality rates for Americans in the age group of 1 to 19 years jumped by 10.7 percent, according to data collected and published by JAMA Network from the American Medical Association. This was followed by an 8.3 percent spike between 2020 and 2021. The total mortality rate in the two years between 2019 and 2021 was 19 percent&mdash;the biggest increase in at least 50 years. &ldquo;These increases, the largest in decades, followed a period of great progress in reducing pediatric mortality rates,&rdquo; the editorial stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This reversal in the pediatric mortality trajectory was caused not by COVID-19, but by injuries,&rdquo; the editorial stated. &ldquo;In 2020, the COVID-19 mortality rate at ages 1 to 19 years was 0.24 deaths per 100 000, but the absolute increase in injury deaths alone was nearly 12 times higher (2.80 deaths per 100 000).&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2019 and 2020, injury mortality rose by 22.6 percent among those between the ages of 10 and 19, with homicides rising by 39.1 percent and drug overdose deaths jumping by 113.5 percent. Among children aged 1 to 9 years, injuries accounted for 63.7 percent of the increase in all-cause mortality in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve now reached a tipping point where the number of injury-related deaths is so high that it is offsetting many of the gains we&rsquo;ve made in treating other diseases,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Wolf, an author of the editorial and an assistant professor in the department of pediatrics at the Virginia Commonwealth University&rsquo;s School of Medicine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The editorial points out that the increase in injury deaths predates the pandemic. For instance, suicides among individuals between 10 and 19 years of age began to rise in 2007, with homicide rates starting to increase in 2013.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2007 and 2019, mortality rates for suicide rose by 69.5 percent. Between 2013 and 2019, homicide rates increased by 32.7 percent. The editorial blamed the increase in suicide and homicide rates on a &ldquo;deepening&rdquo; mental health crisis and access to firearms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fear created by the pandemic, the share of COVID-19 in deaths among children and young people (CYP) was lower when compared to other causes, according to a Jan. 30 study published in JAMA Network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study identified 821 deaths among CYP aged 0 to 19 years between August 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022, in the United States and compared it with other causes of death in 2019 prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 was ranked eighth among all causes of death within this demographic, accounting for 2 percent of all causes of death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the National Center for Health Statistics, unintentional injuries were the leading cause of death among children in 2020, accounting for 12.5 percent of deaths below the age of 12 and 31.4 percent of deaths among adolescents aged 12-17.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 accounted for 0.3 percent of deaths in children under the age of 12 and 0.8 percent of deaths among those aged 12-17.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health among children and adolescents worsened during the pandemic per a paper published in The Lancet Psychiatry that analyzed emergency department visits. The analysis found a 22 percent jump in youth visits for suicide attempts when comparing the period prior to the pandemic to the pandemic period until July 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This surge in suicide visits happened even though there was a 32 percent reduction in pediatric emergency department visits for health-related reasons during the pandemic. In addition, there was also an 8 percent increase in visits for suicidal ideation&mdash;referring to individuals who entertain suicidal thoughts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study on the National Poison Data System found that suspected suicide attempts through self-poisoning among children rose by 26.7 percent between 2015 and 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of children&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/david-strom/2023/03/15/fda-pushing-vaccine-boosters-for-infants-based-upon-trials-in-just-24-children-n537177"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/david-strom/2023/03/15/fda-pushing-vaccine-boosters-for-infants-based-upon-trials-in-just-24-children-n537177</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FDA pushing vaccine boosters for infants based upon trials in just 24 children</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA has approved the use of a new bivalent COVID-19 booster for children 6 months old to 4 years old based upon trials that included almost no children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">24 participants for the 6-month-23-month cohort, and 36 for the 2 years through 4 years old cohort. 60 children in all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are tens of millions of children in these age cohorts, and while this sort of trial is better than one where only 9 mice are given the jab, it strikes me as bizarre that the FDA is pushing this out the door and recommending that all children in America be vaccinated with a jab that has barely been tested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particularly given that the COVID virus presents almost no threat to any children those ages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European countries have pulled back from recommending or even giving COVID vaccines to people under 50, except in cases where the patient is in a high-risk category. It beggars belief that the United States FDA is still going full steam ahead recommending vaccines that are not actually approved&ndash;they are being given under an Emergency Use Authorization, not full approval&ndash;to millions of children at little risk for serious disease.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the FDA admits that there are side effects, because of course there are. There are with everything. Side effects can be justified if the benefits outweigh the downsides, but there really is no evidence that the benefits are there.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Biden Administration Is Trying to Bail Out Moderna</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Americans' eyes and justified outrage are aimed at the Biden administration's "not a bailout" bailout of failed banks, there's an even larger bailout &mdash; and potentially a new scandal for Biden &mdash; his administration is pursuing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the Biden Department of Justice has inserted the federal government &mdash; and with it hardworking American taxpayers &mdash; into a patent infringement dispute alleging that Moderna stole intellectual property from smaller biotech companies and used it to create and produce its COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that's since been administered more than 250 million times in the U.S. and sent the company's revenue soaring.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the two small biotech companies alleging patent infringement &mdash; called Arbutus and Genevant &mdash; Moderna stole their vaccine delivery method that uses lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to protect vaccine-introduced mRNA in the bloodstream and help ensure it reaches the intended target to become effective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderna's response to Arbutus and Genevant has not focused on the companies' claims, but sought to have the case dismissed entirely. Moderna says that, under a World War I-era law found in Section 1498 of U.S. Code, its vaccine development and production is shielded from patent claims because it was under contract to provide the vaccine to the federal government. Moderna maintains its COVID vaccine did not infringe on intellectual property, but said that "dispute is for later."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than allowing the case to play out on its own, the Biden administration &mdash; via Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss &mdash; filed a statement of interest in the dispute last month "to relieve Moderna of any liability for patent infringement resulting in performance of the &rsquo;-0100 Contract and to transfer to the United States any liability for the manufacture or use of the inventions claimed in the Patents-in-Suit resulting from the authorized and consented acts."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The "-0100 Contract" mentioned by the U.S. attorney in its statement of interest is an $8.2 billion contract between Moderna and the Department of Defense coded as "pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the Biden administration appears to be stepping in and seeking to put hardworking American taxpayers on the hook for what could be potentially billions of dollars worth of liability claims caused by Moderna's alleged theft of intellectual property to make its COVID vaccine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would the Biden administration, after the federal government has already poured billions of dollars into Moderna for its COVID vaccine, now seek to bail them out for, potentially, billions more? And why did the Biden DOJ wait until February of 2023 to file a statement of interest when the case against Moderna has been in motion since early 2022?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that's where another twist complicates the Biden DOJ's intervention and raises more questions about how the decision to intervene was made.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. attorney filed the statement of interest on behalf of the Biden DOJ on February 14 and, one day later on February 15, Moderna announced its "commitment to patient access in the United States." The company's announcement states that "Moderna remains committed to ensuring that people in the United States will have access to our COVID-19 vaccines regardless of ability to pay" and Americans who are uninsured or underinsured will still be able to get Moderna's COVID vaccines at pharmacies and doctors' offices at "no cost" to them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the company's revenue was $60 million. It increased to $803 million in 2020, then surged to more than $18 billion in 2021. It seems as though the federal government has done enough to help Moderna by now, and yet the U.S. government intervened on Moderna's behalf in the patent infringement case to say American taxpayers should assume liability for claims stemming from the company's alleged intellectual property theft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the judge hearing claims against Moderna has not sided with the company's &mdash; or the Biden DOJ's &mdash; claims that the federal government (again, read: taxpayers) should be held liable instead, and has ruled against motions to dismiss the case outright.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next week, Moderna's CEO St&eacute;phane Bancel will testify before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. That hearing, led by HELP Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT), is titled "Taxpayers Paid Billions For It: So Why Would Moderna Consider Quadrupling the Price of the COVID Vaccine?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/california-pushes-360k-person-reparations-despite-major-deficit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/california-pushes-360k-person-reparations-despite-major-deficit</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>California pushes for $360,000 per person in reparations despite major deficit</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state-endorsed California Reparations Task Force is pushing to give every black resident $360,000 in reparations despite a major budget deficit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the United States Census Bureau recorded approximately 2.251 million black people residing in California, of whom 1.8 million had at least one ancestor who was a slave, Fox News reported , making the total reparations cost around $640 billion. It is unknown where the state will come up with the funds, however, as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) reported that California is facing a budget deficit of $22.5 billion for this coming fiscal year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chas Alamo, the state's Legislative Analyst's Office's principal fiscal and policy analyst, appeared at the Reparation Task Force's second in-person meeting, in which he proposed further steps that could be taken to fulfill the reparations plan. He proposed several different paths the task force could take to make reparations state law, including the creation of a new agency that would oversee the dispensation of reparations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The creation of a new agency would be initiated through the governor's executive branch and reorganization process, but other options exist," Alamo said, California Black Media reported. "Regardless of the path, to initiate a new agency or enact any other recommendation that makes changes to state law, fundamentally both houses from the state legislature would have to approve the action and the governor will have to sign it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force is due to submit a final report and its accompanying recommendations by July 1. The state legislature, which created the commission amid the fallout from George Floyd's death in 2020, will then vote on the proposal, at which point it will be sent to Newsom to sign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, neither the panel nor any government agency has suggested how the reparations will be paid for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a separate, city-appointed reparations task force in San Francisco recommended giving $5 million in reparations to every black resident, which would total nearly $225 billion.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we begin with world news&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-jet-us-drone-collide-black-sea/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-jet-us-drone-collide-black-sea/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Russian jet collides with American drone over Black Sea, U.S. military says</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Russian Su-27 fighter jet collided with an American military drone over the Black Sea on Tuesday, the U.S. said. The collision made the drone "unflyable" and officials crashed it into the sea, the Pentagon said. The White House called the Russian plane's intercept of the unmanned aircraft "reckless."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9," U.S. Air Force General James Hecker, commander of U.S. Air Forces Europe and Air Forces Africa, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Russian fighter jets were involved in the incident, U.S. European Command said. At approximately 2:03 a.m. EDT Tuesday, one of the Russian jets struck the drone's propeller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the collision, the jets dumped fuel on the drone and flew in front of it "in a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner," European Command said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Russian jet was likely damaged in the incident but it did land afterward, said Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman. He wouldn't say where the jet landed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryder, who wouldn't say whether the drone was armed, referred to the unmanned aircraft as a MQ-9, but not a Reaper. The U.S. uses MQ-9 Reapers for both surveillance and strikes and has operated the drones in a variety of locations, including in the Middle East and Africa. Other countries, including Britain and France, also fly Reapers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reapers can be armed with Hellfire missiles as well as laser-guided bombs and can fly for more than 1,100 miles at altitudes of up to 50,000 feet, according to the Air Force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drone in Tuesday's incident was conducting an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission, Ryder said, adding that he didn't have any details to provide at the time on a possible operation to recover the drone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"To my knowledge at this point in time, the Russians have not recovered that aircraft," Ryder said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said officials were reviewing imagery from the incident to determine if any can be released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow, for its part, denied causing the drone to crash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Russia&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/russia-teams-up-with-china-and-iran-for-joint-military-drills-as-war-tensions-rise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/russia-teams-up-with-china-and-iran-for-joint-military-drills-as-war-tensions-rise/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Russia Teams Up With China And Iran For Joint Military Drills as War Tensions Rise</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three U.S. adversaries are preparing to team their offensives n a series of exercises dubbed &ldquo;Security Bond-2023.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative will run through March 19, demonstrating their naval capacity in a coordinated effort against their enemies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s Defense Ministry said the exercises would &ldquo;help deepen practical cooperation between the participating countries&rsquo; navies &hellip; and inject positive energy into regional peace and stability,&rdquo; The Guardian reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the White House has not expressed any concerns that Russia, China and Iran might using the military drills to escalate conflicts with the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. would continue monitoring the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions have been rising between the West recently due to provocative postures taken over Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and human rights abuses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. continues to sanction Iran for its Government&rsquo;s use of live ammunition on peaceful protests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Russia continues to face unprecedented sanctions and economic pressure from the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three countries stages similar military exercises in 2019 and 2022, as China has sought to strengthen its ties to nations against the U.S and expand its influence throughout the Middle East</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, China brokered a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia to end years of hostility and enter into new diplomatic relations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/court-rules-against-employee-fired-refusing-attend-lgbtq-training-session"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/court-rules-against-employee-fired-refusing-attend-lgbtq-training-session</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Court rules against employee fired for refusing to attend LGBTQ training session</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal appellate court rejected the appeal of a former account clerk in western New York who was fired from his job for refusing to attend a mandatory LGBTQ training in 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raymond Zdunski was employed at Erie 2-Chautauqua-Cattaraugus BOCES for seven years before his termination, which he likened to "unlawful religious discrimination." He sued the organization seeking reinstatement, back pay and $10 million in damages. The Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) is a public organization that was created by the New York State Legislature in 1948 to provide shared educational programs and services to school districts within the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiff had argued that the LGBTQ training and makeup session were "aimed at changing his religious beliefs about gender and sexuality," and that attending the training "would have caused him to violate the religious teachings to which he adheres," according to the lawsuit. BOCES denied his request for a religious accommodation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">District Court Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford dismissed Zdunski's lawsuit in 2022, concluding that his claims were "unsupported" and agreeing with BOCES that he was fired for refusing to attend the trainings, which BOCES had maintained were intended to help prevent discrimination in the workplace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Plaintiff's unsupported assumption that Defendants believe him to be &lsquo;bigoted&rsquo; due to his religious beliefs is insufficient to support an inference of discrimination," Crawford said in his ruling. "In sum, no facts in the record support a finding that Mr. Zdunski was terminated because of his religion; rather, the evidence in the record supports Defendants' position that his termination was due to repeatedly refusing to attend a mandatory employee training."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zdunski's lawyer Kristina S. Heuser, meanwhile, maintained that her client's rights were violated "for no other reason than his refusal to be indoctrinated with anti-biblical teaching."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Though the lower courts did not find in his favor, we are not deterred and will seek redress from the U.S. Supreme Court," she added, according to The Buffalo News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mr. Zdunski was an account clerk," Heuser continued. "He worked on spreadsheets in a cubicle. The training was not even remotely related to the requirements of his job. The Left will stop at nothing to force their ideology upon everyone, including stripping people of their livelihood if they do not submit to their beliefs. Mr. Zdunski refused to violate his sincerely held religious beliefs by submitting to teaching that contradicts what Scripture teaches, which is his absolute right under prevailing federal law. The Court's ruling was clearly erroneous and we intend to petition the United States Supreme Court to hear Mr. Zdunski's case."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. workplaces have in recent years experienced more of a push toward diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). But a recent study found that companies are slashing DEI jobs while workers were leaving these fields at a higher rate than non-DEI positions. The study by Revelio Labs said last year companies who had layoffs cut DEI positions at a 33% rate versus a 21% cut for other roles.</span></p>

<p><strong>James O'Keefe launches O'Keefe Media Group after ouster from Project Veritas</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James O'Keefe appeared on the Charlie Kirk Show to promote his newest project since being ousted from Project Veritas, the O'Keefe Media Group, or OMG.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O'Keefe launched the website on Wednesday and urged viewers to sign up, as did Kirk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O'Keefe said that he's received thousands of emails asking how they can join the cause and how they can help. O'Keefe said that viewers can subscribe to the website, and they can sponsor and pay for a camera that they can use to do their own undercover reporting.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Girls Basketball Team That Refused to Play Against a Transgender Athlete Banned From Sporting Events</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A private Christian school in Vermont that forfeited a girls&rsquo; basketball game against a team with a biological male &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; player has been banned from participating in upcoming sporting events.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vermont Principals&rsquo; Association, which oversees school sporting events, announced on Monday that Mid Vermont Christian School would be ineligible to participate in sporting events and other activities done through the organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The VPA again reiterates its ongoing support of transgender student-athletes as not only a part of building an inclusive community for each student to grow and thrive, but also as a clear expectation by Vermont state law(s) in the Agency of Education Best Practices, and in VPA Policy regarding transgender student athletes,&rdquo; the announcement said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the announcement included the VPA policy on &ldquo;gender identity,&rdquo; which is when a person feels like their gender does not align with their biological sex.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The VPA is committed to providing all students with the opportunity to participate in VPA activities in a manner consistent with their gender identity as is outlined in the Vermont Agency of Education Best Practices For Schools For Transgender And Gender Nonconforming Students,&rdquo; the policy said. &ldquo;The prohibition against discrimination includes discrimination based on a student&rsquo;s actual or perceived sex and gender.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to MVCS, the VPA said that it violated the organization&rsquo;s 1st and 2nd policies, which are &ldquo;commitment to racial, gender-fair and disability awareness&rdquo; and &ldquo;policy on gender identity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Townhall covered March 3 how MVCS was scheduled to compete against Long Trail School on Feb. 21, but pulled out once it learned that the opposing team included a male-bodied athlete.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players,&rdquo; Vicky Fogg, the head of MVCS, said in a statement at the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Allowing biological males to participate in women&rsquo;s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women&rsquo;s sports in general,&rdquo; Fogg added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue of male athletes who believe that they are transgender infiltrating women&rsquo;s sports has made international headlines. Last month, world-renowned surfer Bethany Hamilton, who the movie &ldquo;Soul Surfer&rdquo; is based on, said that she would no longer be competing in professional surfing if the World Surf League moved forward with its inclusive transgender policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Townhall interviewed Riley Gaines, a former swimmer at the University of Kentucky who competed against Will &ldquo;Lia&rdquo; Thomas, the biological male swimmer who began identifying as transgender and competing on the women&rsquo;s swim team at the University of Pennsylvania. At last year&rsquo;s NCAA championships, Gaines and Thomas tied in a race, but Thomas got to take the trophy home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Within the past year, in terms of progress, there has not been a clear solution to the problem [of transgender athletes] at hand. There has still been an influx of biological men competing in women&rsquo;s sports,&rdquo; Gaines, who is a spokeswoman at the Independent Women&rsquo;s Forum, told Townhall.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I think the Lia Thomas situation, bringing this to the national stage, opened a door. People see an opportunity when they see this, and they&rsquo;re willing to take advantage of it. At the expense of, of course, female athletes,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If this continues, it&rsquo;s a slippery slope. It&rsquo;s truly only a matter of time before one transgender athlete winning a national title in the women&rsquo;s category becomes three and five and 10 and so on,&rdquo; Gaines concluded. &ldquo;I think truthfully&hellip;the integrity of women&rsquo;s sports will be lost.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Biden issues order to strengthen gun background checks</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday aiming at increasing background checks to buy guns, promoting more secure firearms storage and ensuring U.S. law enforcement agencies get more out of a bipartisan gun control law enacted last summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic president was to address his latest efforts to curb gun violence in a speech in this suburban Los Angeles community, where a gunman stormed a dance hall and shot 20 people, killing 11, following a Lunar New Year celebration in January. He was also meeting with families of victims and with first responders from that day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s rhetoric has grown ever stronger about guns &mdash; he routinely calls for banning assault weapons &mdash; in pushing a vocal gun-control platform even tougher than during the Obama administration when he was vice president. He has been emboldened by the midterm electiions when his regular talk of gun control didn't result in massive losses, and he's expected to continue to argue for strong changes as he inches toward a 2024 reelection run, his aides say.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden was greeted at the Los Angeles airport Tuesday by Brandon Tsay, the 26-year-old who wrestled the semiautomatic pistol away from the gunman in Monterey Park. The two shook hands; Biden had invited Tsay to his State of the Union address in January where he praised the young man's heroism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the president has only limited power on guns to go beyond bipartisan legislation passed by Congress last summer after the killings last year of 10 shoppers at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store and 19 students and two teachers at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday's action does not change U.S. government policy. Rather, it directs federal agencies to ensure compliance with existing laws and procedures &mdash; a typical feature of executive orders issued by presidents when they confront the limits of their own power to act without cooperation from Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, in the order, acknowledged Congress' opposition, but said, &ldquo;In the meantime, my administration will continue to do all that we can, within existing authority, to make our communities safer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order directs the Cabinet to work on a plan to better structure the government to support communities suffering from gun violence. The plan calls on Attorney General Merrick Garland to shore up the rules for federally licensed gun dealers so they know they are required to do background checks as part of the license.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden is also mandating better reporting of ballistics data from federal law enforcement for a clearinghouse that allows federal, state and local law enforcement to match shell casings to guns. But local and state law enforcement agencies are not required to report ballistics data, and many do not, making the clearinghouse less effective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the president is asking the Federal Trade Commission to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market to minors and use military images to market to the general public.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill passed last year, known as the Safer Communities Act, is viewed by gun control advocates as a good start but one that doesn't go far enough. After the law was signed, there were 11 other mass shootings, according to a database of mass killings since 2006 maintained by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. Those killings don't include shootings in which fewer than four people were killed &mdash; and gun violence is also rising nationwide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-gun groups said the order would do little to stop growing gun violence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The reality is that nothing in the president&rsquo;s executive order today would have done anything to prevent the recent mass shootings in California, Michigan or elsewhere,&rdquo; said Katie Pointer Baney who is the Managing Director of Government Affairs for the U.S. Concealed Carry Association. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for the president and political leaders across the country to have an honest conversation with the American people and acknowledge there is no legislative fix that will permanently solve the issue of gun violence.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will also direct his Cabinet to make sure law enforcement agencies understand the benefits of the new law, particularly around red-flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders, which are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior and prevent them from hurting themselves or others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200 million to help states and the District of Columbia administer red-flag laws and other crisis-intervention programs.</span></p>

<p><strong>DeSantis Admin Moves To Revoke Liquor License From Hotel That Hosted Sexually Explicit Show For Kids</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&rsquo; administration is moving to revoke a hotel&rsquo;s liquor license after it ignored a warning and proceeded to host a sexually explicit show with children present, according to a Tuesday administrative complaint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 27, the Hyatt Regency Miami hosted &ldquo;A Drag Queen Christmas&rdquo; advertised for &ldquo;all ages&rdquo; where performers allegedly wore &ldquo;sexually suggestive clothing&rdquo; and &ldquo;prosthetic female genitalia&rdquo; while displaying &ldquo;simulated sexual activity&rdquo; in front of children, according to an administrative complaint. Prior to the show, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation warned the hotel it would lose its liquor license unless the venue ensured that children were not permitted at the event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Florida law, sexual organs cannot be exposed in public in a vulgar or indecent manner and obscene content cannot be shown to minors, the complaint stated. Violation of the law can result in the loss of a license for the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;On December 27, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation warned the Hyatt Regency Miami against hosting a sexually explicit show with children present,&rdquo; Griffin told the DCNF. &ldquo;The venue proceeded with their plans and, according to an investigation by the Department, the venue (Respondent in the complaint) violated Florida statutes as outlined in the attached complaint.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zuckerberg sacks 10,000 more Meta workers during 'Year of Efficiency'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the tech giant would be laying off around 10,000 workers, with some set to find out whether or not they still have a job as early as tomorrow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move is just the latest in Zuckerberg's quest to make 2023 the "Year of Efficiency" as he and other top executives work to restructure the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech groups, he added, would find out in late April, with those in business groups being informed in late May.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zuckerberg noted that in certain cases, such as for those on international teams, layoffs could take until the end of the year to be finalized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Overall," he said, "we expect to reduce our team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven't yet hired."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zuckerberg justified the decision by explaining that "every layer of a hierarchy adds latency and risk aversion in information flow and decision-making," thus a "flatter" organization would be faster and more capable of creating, maintaining, and delivering the products and services customers want.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and fulfilling," he said. "We will become an even greater magnet for the most talented people. That&rsquo;s why in our Year of Efficiency, we are focused on canceling projects that are duplicative or lower priority and making every organization as lean as possible."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest round of layoffs come just months after Meta reduced its workforce by around 11,000 workers, or 13 percent of the workforce.</span></p>

<p><strong>'Point of No Return': NYC in Policing Crisis as Resignations Reach Record Numbers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Democrat-run cities across America continue to descend into criminal chaos, the nation&rsquo;s largest city is hemorrhaging police officers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive story last week, The New York Post published data that shows New York City (NYC) police officers are resigning from their duties at a shocking rate. Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch called it a &ldquo;staffing emergency&rdquo; that is &ldquo;approaching the point of no return.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statistics show a 117% increase in retiring officers since 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shocking stats show 239 officers tapped out in January and February, a 36% spike from the 176 who fled in the same period last year and a disturbing 117% jump from the 110 in 2021, NYPD pension data show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s the highest number of resignations for the first two months of a year since 250 members quit in 2007 during a contentious contract dispute.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, there seem to be a number of converging factors contributing to the massive loss of personnel in the Big Apple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Lives Matter-led movement to defund police departments across the country has almost certainly created a combination of shrinking budgets to retain employees and a strain on remaining resources. However, corruption and poor management also seems to be a debilitating issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A veteran Manhattan police officer told the Post that precinct cops have to work &ldquo;an inhumane amount of overtime&rdquo; that often includes their days off. At the same time, they are penalized by department bureaucrats for small breaches of uniform and/or administrative protocol. Meanwhile, some officers are being protected from necessary patrol duties by &ldquo;high-ranking supervisors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYPD officers are fleeing to places like Florida, or suburban locations in New York and Connecticut. As the cost of living in NYC sky-rockets, pay remains stagnant. There is also the rapidly declining quality of life. Prolonged school closures, COVID vaccine mandates and unnecessary masking of small children has led to a learning crisis in government schools. A notoriously &lsquo;woke&rsquo; agenda in those same schools has also begun to affect testing levels and education outcomes. Rampant homelessness and open-air drug use make for unsafe streets and public transportation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According the report from The New York Post, 262 city cops retired in just the first two months of 2023, a 3% increase in retirements in the same time period last year. Perhaps the most alarming number uncovered in the report reveals that the NYPD lost 3701 officers in 2022 alone. It is the largest number of officers lost since 2002, following the 9/11 attacks. That year the city lost 3,846 police officers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things don&rsquo;t seem to be looking up any time soon.</span></p>

<p><strong>1.3 Million Guns Sold Last Month: Firearms Sales Still Near Record Levels</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Gun Sales Pass One Million Mark for 43rd Month in a Row in February &ndash; Though sales are down from their record highs of 2020 and 2021, guns are still in hot demand based on the latest retail data and FBI background checks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the firearm industry trade association, sales of firearms surpassed 1.3 million units in February &ndash; even with fewer days on the calendar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, sales had declined just 0.6 percent compared to February 2022 &ndash; based on NSSF-adjusted data from the FBI&rsquo;s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Though not a direct correlation to gun sales, the NSSF-adjusted NICS data provide an additional picture of current market conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">February was the 43rd month in a row to see gun sales exceed a million units.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover announced they would pause their plan to implement a new merchant category code for the nation&rsquo;s gun retailers after political pressure from Republicans, CNN reported.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Resigning Over Bible Quote, Texas Tech Settles for $4.1M Payout for Coach Mark Adams</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now former Texas Tech basketball coach Mark Adams and the university have come to terms with a $4.1 million payout after Adams resigned for using a Bible quote about slaves and masters during a training session with a student.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Red Raiders coach resigned after using a Bible quote, Ephesians, 6:5-9, to encourage a player during a training session. The passage begins, &ldquo;Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not known if Adams actually used the word &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; when he quoted the verse, but it was quickly deemed offensive, and the school suspended him for using it as a training tool.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams seemed to feel it was not a big deal and that it was all blown up out of proportion. He was suspended, regardless. But, despite that the school said he apologized, he later contradicted that and said he did not apologize.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Adams resigned only a few days after the incident was first reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bible quote was not the only issue Adams was facing with school officials. He was also accused of spitting on a player, but he fully denied that claim.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the veracity of the accusations against him, Adams and Texas Tech have now settled on his separation package.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school has agreed to pay Adams $4.1 million in thirty days. The payout will include all bonuses and salaries earned during the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two also agreed to forego any legal actions over the incident and to hold each other blameless going forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Adams hereby agrees to the release of any and all claims against TTU and Texas Tech University System and their employees, appointees, regents and representatives relating to his employment, whether known or unknown, as of the date of this Agreement and TTU agrees to release any and all claims against Adams,&rdquo; the school&rsquo;s settlement reads, according to USA Today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This Agreement is not, and shall not in any way be construed, as an admission by the Parties of wrongdoing whatsoever against each other or that the Parties violated any federal, state or local law, which both Parties deny,&rdquo; the statement added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden says Americans should 'feel confident' in banking system after federal response to SVB collapse</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Biden says Americans should "feel confident" in their banking system after his administration's response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden reiterated a statement from the FDIC and Treasury Department during public remarks Monday morning, telling reporters that the federal government would guarantee depositors at the banks access to their funds. He added that no such protection is being offered to the banks' investors, however. His administration has also fired the leadership at both banks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"No losses will be borne by the taxpayers," Biden emphasized. "Instead, the money will come from the fees that banks pay into the deposit insurance fund. Because of the actions that our regulators have already taken, every American should feel confident that their deposits will be there if and when they need them."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden went on to call on Congress to pass legislation to "strengthen rules" on banks to prevent failures like SVB and Signature.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Clara, California-based band collapsed last week and is now under the control of federal regulators. The SVB had been the 16th-largest bank in the U.S. prior to the bank run that led to its downfall.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Anxious depositors rushed to withdraw their money over concern for the bank&rsquo;s health, causing its collapse, which may serve as "an extinction-level event for startups," according to Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Biden administration had earlier assured SVB depositors that they would have access to all of their funds on Sunday. The joint statement from the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also emphasized that the action would come at no cost to US taxpayers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system," the joint statement said. "This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden delivered his Monday remarks in a short briefing before traveling to California, where he is set to announce the sale of nuclear submarines to Australia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&lsquo;Close To Sinful&rsquo;: Biden Floats Possibility Of Nation-Wide Transgender Law</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden appeared to criticize Ron DeSantis on his handling of transgender youth and floated the possibility of a nation-wide transgender law in an interview clip released Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on in Florida, is as my mother would say, &lsquo;close to sinful.&rsquo; I mean, it&rsquo;s just terrible what they&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; Biden said while speaking with actor Kal Penn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://youtu.be/9CtCG3qLjPY"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Kal Penn previews interview with Biden, discusses guest-hosting \&quot;The Daily Show\&quot;&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/9CtCG3qLjPY&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Kal Penn previews interview with Biden, discusses guest-hosting "The Daily Show"</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Play 2:12-2:56</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">DeSantis has led an administration-wide effort to ban sex change treatments for minors. He has said doctors should be sued for performing sex changes on children and suspended a state attorney refusing to adhere to the child sex change ban.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">DeSantis also requested public universities report how many students they treated for &ldquo;gender dysphoria,&rdquo; and in October, the Florida Board of Medicine voted to ban sex change surgeries and hormone therapy for children under 18.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Dylan Mulvaney, a man who identifies as a woman and has garnered attention on social media for using hyper-feminine stereotypes, asked Biden in October if he thinks states should &ldquo;have the right&rdquo; to ban &ldquo;gender-affirming health care.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any state or anybody should have the right to do that, as a moral question and a legal question,&rdquo; Biden responded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I just think it&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Biden added. &ldquo;I feel very, very strongly that you should have every single solitary right, including, including use of your gender identity bathroom in public.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Women now binge drinking more than men for first time in history, doctor warns</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">For the first time in history, women are outpacing men in binge drinking, which is a growing concern among health officials as overall drinking for young adults is on the rise. As the pandemic came to an end, they seem to be drinking more than ever.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In 2020, during the pandemic, we saw a continuing decline in binge drinking among college-age students. Most were isolated or at home as classes moved online. Group activities or parties where drinking would be prevalent simply were not happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;In 2021, there has been an uptick, particularly among women. Now it turns out on college campuses women are actually binge drinking more than men, for the first time in history,&rdquo; said Dr. George F. Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Koob said while drinking overall was down during the pandemic, deaths associated with alcohol were up 25% for not just college students but the general population. Koob believes isolation contributed to mental health problems and substance abuse across the board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, now we&rsquo;re back. People are going to parties, and colleges and bars are open again. Restaurants are serving bottomless brunch, and wineries and breweries are ready to pour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what we call the alcohol deprivation effect. People tend to really rebound in drinking after a period of not drinking.&rdquo; Koob said. &ldquo;We are a little concerned that this spring and spring break is going to be a return to a good amount of binge drinking. I just want to caution everyone that when you start hitting the binge drinking level you start doing really bad things to your body.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">So, where does this leave this new group of women who are binge drinking more than ever before? Koob said knowing what a standard drink is and your limit is important to taking care of your health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As social media trends encourage dangerous &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; to binge drinking, including the viral &ldquo;BORGs&rdquo; or &ldquo;blackout rage gallons&rdquo; which combine water, electrolytes, and vodka, TikTok is specifically pushing the misconception that this drink will keep you hydrated while drinking copious amounts of liquor.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Massive fight among 200 students, parents at Louisiana high school ends in 10 arrests</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An explosive fight at a Louisiana high school among nearly 200 students and parents ended with several cops injured and at least 10 arrests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Swarms of police officers responded early March 8 to a &ldquo;major campus disturbance&rdquo; at East Baton Rouge Readiness Alternative School, finding a loaded gun abandoned on the ground, WBRZ reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Officials say one fight broke out and escalated, spilling out into the school&rsquo;s courtyard and gym. By the time police arrived, there were about 200 people involved in brawls across the campus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Videos of the chaos taken inside the school&rsquo;s gym show chairs getting tossed and students being detained by law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">One shocking video shows a sheriff&rsquo;s deputy forcefully hitting a student&rsquo;s face into a brick wall. The officer was trying to arrest a 17-year-old student, authorities said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police said the teen had punched the officer in the face and tried to bite him, which led to the aggressive encounter captured on video. The teen was among those charged with battery on an officer and resisting arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Officials have not yet determined what triggered the massive melee at the school, which enrolls students who&rsquo;ve been previously suspended or expelled from other district schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The NAACP released a statement Wednesday saying it was reviewing videos from the incident to decide if the aggressive police response captured on video was appropriate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The fight allegedly started with a small group of students but escalated into a larger clash involving parents and students fighting police as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">One witness told WBRZ the brawl erupted when a girl who wasn&rsquo;t a student at the school and her mom showed up to fight another girl &mdash; and that it escalated from there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Students were allegedly locked inside the gym during the fight. One responding police officer sustained injuries including a broken hip and head lacerations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also among those arrested were three students charged with battery on a police officer, a felony.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Five other students were arrested for disturbing the peace, including an 18-year-old girl who was arrested on counts of unlawful disruption of the operation of a school and resisting arrest, and a 17-year-old girl hit with disturbing the peace and resisting arrest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">All of those arrested were students between 15 and 18. None of the parents or other adults at the scene were taken into custody.</span></p>
