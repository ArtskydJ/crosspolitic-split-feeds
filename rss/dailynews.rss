<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/21/biden-admin-religious-student-groups-protections-campus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/21/biden-admin-religious-student-groups-protections-campus/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Admin Looking To Remove Religious Student Groups&rsquo; Protections On Campus</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education (DOE) announced a proposal Tuesday rescinding a Trump-era policy that prohibited universities from receiving federal funding if they restricted religious student group activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 policy, initially signed by former President Donald Trump as part of an executive order in 2019, was proposed to prevent universities from censoring the speech of religious students on campus, according to the Washington Post. The DEO&rsquo;s recent announcement indicates that President Joe Biden is looking to end the policy, claiming the protections caused an &ldquo;unduly burdensome role&rdquo; for the department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[T]he Department believes it is not necessary in order to protect the First Amendment right to free speech and free exercise of religion given existing legal protections, it has caused confusion about schools&rsquo; nondiscrimination requirements, and it prescribed a novel and unduly burdensome role for the Department in investigating allegations regarding public institutions&rsquo; treatment of religious student organizations,&rdquo; the announcement read. &ldquo;We have not seen evidence that the regulation has provided meaningfully increased protection for religious student organizations beyond the robust First Amendment protections that already exist, much less that it has been necessary to ensure they are able to organize and operate on campus.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement came from Nassar H. Paydar, Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Education, who explained that since September 2021 the DOE had been looking into current policies regarding the First Amendment that &ldquo;impose additional requirements on its higher education institutional grant recipients.&rdquo; Paydar noted that during that time, the DOE determined that the 2020 policy had placed a burden on the higher education system and did not provide any &ldquo;meaningfully increased protection for religious student organizations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told the Washington Post that the rule protects religious students from being &ldquo;forced to choose between their faith and their education&rdquo; and would also protect religious universities from being turned away for federal funding because of their religious affiliation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The public comment phase will begin on Wednesday, Feb. 22, and remain open for 30 days for anyone to comment and provide their thoughts on the proposal, according to the announcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alaska-republican-touts-benefits-children-being-abused-death-1782972"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsweek.com/alaska-republican-touts-benefits-children-being-abused-death-1782972</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alegislature in Alaska caused outrage after questioning whether the death of child abuse victims could be "a cost savings," because it would mean they don't need "government services" later in life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican David Eastman, who sits in the Alaska House of Representatives, made the comment on Monday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee was meeting to discuss how children are impacted by physical or sexual abuse, as well as witnessing domestic violence within their family home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers were shown a study indicating each incident of fatal child abuse costs society $1.5 million, a figure reached by assessing the impact of trauma and the child's loss of earnings over a lifetime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Eastman was unimpressed, and questioned whether fatal child abuse could be economically beneficial to wider society, an argument he claimed to have heard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eastman said: "It can be argued, periodically, that it's actually a cost savings because that child is not going to need any of those government services that they might otherwise be entitled to receive and need based on growing up in this type of environment."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remark horrified Trevor Storrs, president of the Alaska Children's Trust (ACT), who hit back describing the loss of a child as "unmeasurable."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Representative Cliff Groh, who used to work as a prosecutor covering child abuse allegations, said he was "disturbed" by Easterman's comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representative Sarah Vance, the Republican who claims the House Judiciary Committee, said Easterman, who doesn't serve on any committees, had been at the hearing "at my invitation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance later suggested Eastman had been trying to make an argument against abortion, which some consider to be "child abuse."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with the Anchorage Daily News via text message, Eastman said: "I was pleased to hear ACT advocating against child abuse, but a child's value comes not from future productivity, but from the fact that every child is made in the image of God."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-police-defunding-crime-ravages-locals-huge-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-police-defunding-crime-ravages-locals-huge-crisis</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle reverses course on defunding police as crime ravages locals: 'A huge crisis'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle residents Victoria Beach, Eli Hoshor and Jonathan Choe said police shortages have left their city in dire straits in the aftermath of officials' anti-law enforcement rhetoric.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homicides skyrocketed by 24% while motor vehicle thefts climbed by 30% in the city last year. Overall crime ticked up by 4%.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Bruce Harrell pushed for increased police presence to curb the issue Tuesday, saying, "We need immediate action and innovation to respond to our public safety issues&hellip; Seattle saw a 4% rise in reported crime last year&hellip; We need more officers to address our staffing crisis."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, some residents' outlook is less than optimistic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piro reported data from Seattle's city's budget office showing funding for law enforcement increased for the first time since a major slash was made in 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoshor, a resident, says the uptick is not enough to reduce crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The crime is just getting worse and worse," he said. "There's a homeless encampment that's right next to my son's school that's been there for over a year, and it's doubled and tripled in size.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choe, a reporter from the area, slammed the "Defund the Police" movement for being behind the crime rise as well as the "woke" activist class who he said are perpetuating the problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that seeing how "Defund the Police" supporters respond to Harrell's push for more police and the uptick in funding for the department should be "interesting."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-seattle-forced-to-pay-3-6-million-in-2020-autonomous-zone-damages-to-business-owners?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-seattle-forced-to-pay-3-6-million-in-2020-autonomous-zone-damages-to-business-owners?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle forced to pay $3.6 MILLION in 2020 CHAZ damages to business owners</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Seattle has agreed to pay $3,650,000 in damages to business owners who brought suit after the deadly 2020 Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) damaged their business, property, and violated their constitutional rights. The group had originally been seeking $2.9 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city has until March 3 to pay the sum as part of a settlement revealed last week. According to court filings regarding the settlement, $600,000 will go toward attorney fees for the more than a dozen plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The settlement came just weeks after a federal judge imposed sanctions against the city for deleting thousands of text messages between Seattle officials including former Mayor Jenny Durkan, former police chief Carmen Best, and Fire Chief Harold Scoggins during the armed occupation by Antifa and BLM rioters of 6 square blocks of the Capitol Hill neighborhood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CHAZ, also known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest or CHOP, was established by activists on June 8, 2020, after Seattle police were ordered by police leadership to abandon the department&rsquo;s East Precinct during the riots that rocked the Emerald City in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minn. on May 25, 2020. Video of his death emerged, setting off months of riots in the midst of a pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1270925505190146048"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1270925505190146048</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zone occupiers refused to allow police into the area. Rapes, robberies, and murders spiked 250 percent in the 6-block area during the occupation. The zone lasted 3 weeks before it was finally broken up by police on July 1, 2020, after two fatal shootings and rioters vandalized then Mayor Durkan's home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1271249933765656578"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1271249933765656578</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court documents, business owners alleged that city officials&rsquo; "unprecedented decision to abandon and close off" the 16-block section of the neighborhood "subjected businesses, employees, and residents to extensive property damage, public safety dangers, and an inability to use and access their properties."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was revealed after the occupation that Seattle officials, including former Mayor Jenny Durkan, former police chief Carmen Best, and Fire Chief Harold Scoggins deleted thousands of text messages from their city-owned phones regarding the zone, including communications with the infamous &ldquo;warlord&rdquo; of the autonomous zone, Raz Simone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US District Judge Thomas Zilly previously sanctioned the city and thereby allowed the jury to view the missing evidence as a strike against the city in the case. Zilly Wrote, &ldquo;City officials deleted thousands of text messages from their city-owned phones in complete disregard of their legal obligation to preserve relevant evidence. Further, the city significantly delayed disclosing &hellip; that thousands of text messages had been deleted&rdquo; and could not be reproduced or recovered.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/npr-layoffs-10-percent-job-cuts-john-lansing-1235331693/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/npr-layoffs-10-percent-job-cuts-john-lansing-1235331693/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR to Cut Workforce by 10 Percent, as Advertising Slowdown Hits Public Media</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our financial outlook has darkened considerably over recent weeks,&rdquo; Lansing wrote in a memo to staff Wednesday. &ldquo;At a time when we are doing some of our most ambitious and essential work, the global economy remains uncertain. As a result, the ad industry has weakened and we are grappling with a sharp decline in our revenues from corporate sponsors. We had created a plan to address a $20M sponsorship revenue falloff for FY23 but we are now projecting at least a $30M shortfall. The cuts we have already made to our budget will not be enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Lansing says that most of NPR&rsquo;s open jobs will be eliminated, and that it will be reducing its existing workforce by 10 percent. More than 700 employees work at the public media firm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lansing also suggested that the necessary job cuts will result in a more refined mission for NPR as an organization, writing that &ldquo;some work will need to change or stop entirely,&rdquo; and that NPR&rsquo;s executive committee is figuring out where it needs to continue investing, and where it should pull back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of NPR&rsquo;s most popular programs (on both terrestrial radio and in podcast form) include Fresh Air, Planet Money, Wait Wait&hellip; Don&rsquo;t Tell Me, and Up First. It also has a sizable news division that produces journalism that runs across its programming.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former NFL Player Eric Johnson Among 8 People Arrested For Human Trafficking &amp; Gang Charges</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson, 46, played in The League from 2000-2005 with the Oakland Raiders, Atlanta Falcons, and Arizona Cardinals. He&rsquo;s now part of an apparent trafficking ring that stands accused of multiple acts involving four adult women and one female minor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr says the LOTTO Gang members &ndash; including Johnson &ndash; are facing charges of trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, violation of the street gang terrorism and prevention act, conspiracy to violate the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) Act, aggravated assault and kidnapping.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ypZMdMVwf54"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Eric Johnson, former Atlanta Falcon charged in human trafficking, racketeering case&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/ypZMdMVwf54&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Eric Johnson, former Atlanta Falcon charged in human trafficking, racketeering case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he&rsquo;s certainly not a household name by any means, Eric Johnson is known for one significant moment in NFL history. He scored a touchdown in the Raiders&rsquo; 48-21 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII. He blocked a punt and then returned it for 13 yards for the score.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief, for Wednesday, February 22nd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2023/02/21/retailers-to-shut-down-over-800-big-box-stores-as-inflation-anemic-sales-and-interest-rates-create-perfect-storm-n706431"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2023/02/21/retailers-to-shut-down-over-800-big-box-stores-as-inflation-anemic-sales-and-interest-rates-create-perfect-storm-n706431</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers to Shut Down Over 800 Big-Box Stores as Inflation, Anemic Sales and Interest Rates Create Perfect Storm</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retail world continues its downward spiral, as holiday sales failed to meet expectations and wary consumers are keeping their wallets in their pockets due to rampant inflation and soaring interest rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2022 Christmas holiday sales did increase from the prior year; it&rsquo;s just that expectations were primed for an even higher increase after two years of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result: over 800 big-box stores are slated to shut down across the country in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Walmart, Gap, and Party City are among the big names who will be downsizing. Bath &amp; Beyond, which narrowly escaped bankruptcy proceedings earlier this month, is the biggest loser, aiming to cut its number of stores to 480 when it once had over 1,500 locations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 416 stores have been identified for closure, along with all 65 of its locations in Canada. Thirty-five will close in California alone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up is homegoods outlet Tuesday Morning, which will close 265 stores as it struggles to survive through bankruptcy proceedings. Once again, California will be hardest hit, with 30 stores shutting their doors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macy&rsquo;s, Big Lots, JCPenny, and even Amazon Fresh grocery stores also have plans to shutter locations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&rsquo;s going on here? CNBC explains:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For retailers, the shopping season&rsquo;s results reflect the challenges ahead. As Americans continue to pay higher prices for groceries, housing and more month after month, they are racking up credit card balances, spending down savings and having fewer dollars for discretionary spending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, retailers are following years of extraordinary spending. During the Covid pandemic, Americans fought boredom and used stimulus checks by buying loungewear, throw pillows, kitchen supplies, home theater systems and more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Party City, the ubiquitous entertainment supply chain, has filed for bankruptcy and is in the process of auctioning off many of its leases. NJBIZ reports:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Party City Holdco Inc. is looking to shrink its retail footprint as part of an expedited financial restructuring.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Feb. 16 filing with U.S. bankruptcy court, the Woodcliff Lake-based operator of 800-plus stores said it is working with A&amp;G Real Estate Partners to auction off leases for 12 underperforming locations in six states. In coming weeks, additional lease auctions will follow, with the total number of closures depending on the outcome of ongoing negotiations with landlords, according to A&amp;G.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, this is not a new trend. CVS, Rite-Aid, Kroger, Nordstrom, and Best Buy have also been quietly culling their stores over the last several years. Another factor: many locations are closing simply because they&rsquo;re not safe to operate as lax laws and woke prosecutors have turned many spots into virtual free-for-alls for organized shoplifters.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol now begs for help to stop 800% surge of migrants sneaking in from Canada</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Border Patrol is begging agents to volunteer in the north after a staggering nearly-850% surge of mostly-Mexican migrants illegally crossing into the US from Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency&rsquo;s Swanton Sector in Vermont &mdash; covering parts of upstate New York and New Hampshire &mdash; requested a &ldquo;quick turnaround&rdquo; of agents from the already overwhelmed southern border to make their way north to volunteer for at least a month starting next week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help is needed to control the &ldquo;strain caused by the surge&rdquo; of &ldquo;primarily Mexican migrants with no legal documents,&rdquo; Swanton&rsquo;s Chief Patrol Agent Robert Garcia wrote in a memo obtained this week by Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Due to the increased numbers, stations are task saturated with processing large groups, which has contributed&rdquo; to more migrants being able to slip into the country, the memo notes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The request came a week after Garcia reported that crossings had reached &ldquo;historic highs&rdquo; &mdash; even as temperatures plummet to deadly lows of minus-four degrees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His sector said that the current fiscal year &mdash; which started in October &mdash; &ldquo;demonstrates an approximate 846% increase in encounters and apprehensions compared to the same period&rdquo; in the previous year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the first four months of the current fiscal year have seen more encounters than the whole of the previous two years combined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, agents recorded 367 apprehensions and encounters &mdash; more than the total of the past 12 Januarys combined, which was 344.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desperate conditions in the south have also seen a steady flow of agents transferred there from the north, creating part of the &ldquo;vulnerability,&rdquo; Clem said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He blamed electronic travel authorization for allowing migrants to travel &ldquo;basically visa-free&rdquo; from Mexico to Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Swanton sector has seen families with young kids, even infants, crossing, and late last year provided life-saving aid in separate incidents in Vermont and upstate New York, Garcia said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Lemon to undergo 'formal training' after sexist remarks about Nikki Haley, will be back on CNN Wednesday</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Lemon is set to return to the air on Wednesday after beign removed from CNN This Morning over sexist comments he made about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley's age.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1626263301758898176"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1626263301758898176</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longtime host will reportedly be taking part in "formal training" to help him understand why what he said was wrong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Brian Stelter, CNN CEO Chris Licht sent a memo to staff on Monday outlining the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemon said in a tweet: The reference I made to a woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;prime&rdquo; this morning was inartful and irrelevant, as colleagues and loved ones have pointed out, and I regret it. A woman&rsquo;s age doesn't define her either personally or professionally. I have countless women in my life who prove that every day.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Veritas HEMORRHAGES Twitter followers after release of founder James O'Keefe</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Project Veritas lost over 80,000 followers on social media after it was announced company founder James O'Keefe was removed from the organization, which he founded in 2011, after the board placed him on paid leave earlier in February.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Social Blade, a social media analytics website, the live tally as of 4:30 pm showed Project Veritas had lost almost 80,000 followers on Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since February 16, on YouTube, Project Veritas has lost over 10,000 followers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A February 6 memo leaked from 16 Project Veritas employees detailed their problems with the news organization's founder and claimed he exhibited "cruel behavior."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"James has become a power drunk tyrant and he is exactly who he pontificates on who we should be exposing," wrote one of the employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial reporting on Monday from Neil McCabe of OAN claimed O'Keefe had resigned. Later, RC Maxwell from Project Veritas said O'Keefe was in fact removed from his role as CEO by the Board.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/20/turkey-new-6-point-4-magnitude-earthquake-hatay"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/20/turkey-new-6-point-4-magnitude-earthquake-hatay</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turkey hit by two more powerful earthquakes two weeks after disaster</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 6.4-magnitude earthquake and a second measuring 5.8 have hit Turkey&rsquo;s southern province of Hatay, terrifying those left in a region devastated by twin earthquakes two weeks ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turkey&rsquo;s interior minister, S&uuml;leyman Soylu, said that at least three people were killed and 213 wounded by the latest quakes, after a large government hospital in the city of İskenderun in the north of Hatay province declared it was evacuating patients.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest quakes, less powerful than the 7.8- and 7.5-magnitude earthquakes that tore a path of destruction through southern Turkey and northern Syria on 6 February, threaten yet more devastation in a region where many people have fled their destroyed homes for the safety of other towns and villages outside the quake zone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The larger quake struck at a depth of just 2km (1.2 miles), the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said, potentially magnifying its impact at ground level. It was centred near the southern Turkish city of Antakya and was felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turkey&rsquo;s disaster management agency AFAD said the epicentre of the larger quake was below the Defne district of Hatay, in a region where many have complained of a lacklustre government response to the first earthquakes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll in Turkey from the quakes two weeks ago rose to 41,156 on Monday, AFAD said, and was expected to climb further, with 385,000 apartments known to have been destroyed or seriously damaged and many people still missing. At least 47,000 people are estimated to have died across Turkey and Syria.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Turkish president, said construction work on nearly 200,000 apartments in 11 earthquake-hit provinces of Turkey would begin next month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hours earlier, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on a visit to Turkey that Washington would help &ldquo;for as long as it takes&rdquo; as rescue operations and aftershocks were winding down and the focus turned towards urgent shelter and reconstruction work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In rebel-held Syria, local search and rescue services and the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, reported the latest earthquakes had damaged buildings across a number of cities and towns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said people had been injured by falling debris and stampedes, as well as jumping from elevated positions in fear of the destruction.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China Considering &lsquo;Lethal&rsquo; Aid for Russia: Blinken</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese regime could be considering providing lethal aid to Russia, according to U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, which, if confirmed, would represent an unprecedented escalation of China&rsquo;s presence in the Russia-Ukraine war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[F]or the most part, China has been engaged in providing rhetorical, political, diplomatic support to Russia. But we have information that gives us concern that they are considering providing lethal support to Russia in the war against Ukraine,&rdquo; Blinken told ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; program on Sunday, after meeting with China&rsquo;s top diplomat, Wang Yi, at the Munich Security Conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang spoke at the conference on Feb. 18 and said the Chinese regime is working on a &ldquo;peace proposal&rdquo; to reconcile the two sides of the conflict. Blinken indicated that the stipulated intention appears to run contrary to what is indicated in intelligence held by the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang and Blinken&rsquo;s meeting marked the first face-to-face exchange between the two sides since the surveillance balloon incident that set off an uproar in the United States and forced Blinken to cancel a planned visit to Beijing, bringing the relationship between the leader of the liberal democratic world and the leader of authoritarian governments to a freezing point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hours before the meeting, Wang described the U.S. shootdown of the Chinese spy balloon that enter U.S. airspace without permission as &ldquo;hysterical,&rdquo; &ldquo;unimaginable,&rdquo; and a violation of international norms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese regime insists that the spy balloon is a weather balloon intended mainly for research purposes; the United States rejects this contention saying that it detected other equipment onboard and downed the spy balloon with an F-22 fighter jet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement following the U.S.-China exchange in Germany, China&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it does not &ldquo;accept the U.S.&rsquo;s finger-pointing or even coercion targeting China-Russia relations&rdquo; and, regarding the balloon incidence, threatened that the United States &ldquo;should be prepared to bear all consequence arising from an escalation.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaked letter details James O'Keefe's response following indefinite no-pay suspension from Project Veritas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leaked letter exclusively obtained by The Post Millennial reveals Project Veritas' founder James O'Keefe's statement to staffers on Monday after he was effectively removed from the organization by the board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter includes screenshots of the board's meeting on Feb. 10 in which they voted three-to-two for his "indefinite suspension as CEO without compensation" pending an "audit."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v2a7mig-james-okeefe-to-pv-staff-ive-been-removed-from-ceo-and-board.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v2a7mig-:james-okeefe-to-pv-staff-ive-been-removed-from-ceo-and-board.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video - Play 16:50-18:22</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear if O'Keefe will resign from Project Veritas or be fired, though Project Veritas spokesman RC Maxwell said in a statement to TPM: "I unfortunately don&rsquo;t have any answers for you, the Project Veritas board is in charge now." O'Keefe declined to comment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPM understands that the board of directors plan to have a meeting and vote on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Project Veritas staffers had made allegations to the board that O'Keefe's curt leadership style was offensive to staff and donors. One large allegation of him being rude to a "high-net-worth" Oregon donor couple was refuted by the couple itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1624529211544244224"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1624529211544244224</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O'Keefe's 4,600-word letter to staffers details the emotional turmoil he and the organization have experienced in the 13 years since its founding from his parent's carriage house in New Jersey. They include what he believes are years of lawfare and corrupt criminal investigations aimed at stopping his organization from exposing powerful individuals and organizations. He also concedes to the staffers' main grievances about his leadership style.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I haven't always been the most ostensibly compassionate leader - and that is admittedly a fault, something I need to work on," he wrote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since being suspended by the board, supporters of O'Keefe have speculated about the timing given that only days earlier Project Veritas had broken the most-viewed story in its history about a Pfizer executive who said that the pharmaceutical company worked on mutating the Covid-19 virus. O'Keefe references this in his letter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&rsquo;Keefe&rsquo;s letter also includes a screenshot of an alleged text message conversation between an unnamed board member and a Project Veritas staffer discussing getting a raise if O&rsquo;Keefe is removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O'Keefe continues sharing his side of the internal dispute and closes the letter by suggesting he is prepared to start a new organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"So our mission continues on &mdash; I'm not done. The mission will perhaps take on a new name, and it may no longer be called Project Veritas. I'll need a bunch of people around me and I will make sure sure you know how to find me."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;&rsquo;</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/woke-california-university-slammed-dehumanized-initiative-encouraging-students-tell-professors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/woke-california-university-slammed-dehumanized-initiative-encouraging-students-tell-professors</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Woke' California university slammed for 'dehumanized' initiative encouraging students to tell on professors</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College students are pushing back against a "woke" California university for encouraging students to tell on professors for racism if they aren't called on "consistently" during class.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Reform correspondents Courtney McLain, Emily Sturge, and Darryl Boyer joined "Fox &amp; Friends Weekend" to discuss the broader issues at hand with the far-left infusion of the "woke" agenda in college classrooms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California State University Monterey Bay has faced criticism for urging non-White students to report "race-related stress" under the Personal Growth and Counseling Center tab on its website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Document acts of racism or intolerance. Don't ignore or minimize your experiences, and think broadly about what could be an act of racism. It doesn't have to be an overt act (e.g., professor consistently not calling on you or minimizing your contributions, curriculum racially biased, etc). Talk to someone you trust, and report it," a webpage on "Coping with Racism and Discrimination" says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the university website, race-related stress can cause psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia, and self-blame, as well as physiological health concerns such as heart disease, hypertension, and muscle tension.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McLain, who is a student at University of Central Florida, noted her angst surrounding the move, citing concerns as to how it affects academic progress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am seeing more and more of this diversity, equity and inclusion being forced by my school, and I'm frustrated because I feel like I'm not learning as much academically as I could because we're putting so much money into this," McLain said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the widespread effort of the far left, the trio touted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis,' R., efforts to counter indoctrination in the state's classrooms.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train derails outside Detroit, Michigan, with one car carrying hazardous materials</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A train containing one car of hazardous materials has derailed Thursday in Van Buren Township outside Detroit, Michigan, reports say.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause of the derailment was not immediately clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police told Fox2 Detroit that there were no injuries and the area is not a hazmat situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials that spoke to WXYZ, which reported that at least six cars were seen off the track, said one of them was carrying hazardous materials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The derailment comes less than two weeks after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police told Fox2 Detroit that roads will be closed in the area while an investigation is ongoing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy also said it is "aware of the train derailment in Van Buren Township, Wayne County, where initial reports indicate no threat to the public from the derailment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"EGLE personnel are on their way to the scene to assist in assessing the situation," it added.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden admin turns down Ohio's request for disaster assistance after toxic derailment</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration turned down a request for federal disaster assistance from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine in the aftermath of the train derailment in the state earlier this month that led to a large release of toxic chemicals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Ohio's state government that it was not eligible for disaster assistance to help the community recover from the toxic spill, Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for DeWine, told Fox News Digital on Thursday. Tierney explained that FEMA believed the incident didn't qualify as a traditional disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, for which it usually provides assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The DeWine Administration has been in daily contact with FEMA to discuss the need for federal support, however FEMA continues to tell Governor DeWine that Ohio is not eligible for assistance at this time," DeWine's office said in a statement earlier in the day. "Governor DeWine will continue working with FEMA to determine what assistance can be provided."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA said that its team is in constant communication with DeWine's office, but didn't comment on the request for federal relief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tierney noted, though, that the governor was able to secure some health assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services that will go towards helping local residents with any medical care costs that stem from the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk Southern has offered financial compensation to locals who were displaced and has worked with the Environmental Protection Agency and state officials to conduct air safety tests. Health officials have assured the public that tests have shown the area is safe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruce Willis Diagnosed With Frontotemporal Dementia, Family Says</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, his family said in a statement Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 67-year-old &ldquo;Die Hard&rdquo; star was diagnosed with the disease, also known as FTD, after his prior diagnosis of aphasia progressed, his family said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disease&rsquo;s progression varies from two to more than 20 years and the average life expectancy after the start of symptoms is seven to 13 years. There is no cure or treatment currently available, according to the AFTD&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willis&rsquo; family said that by sharing his story they hope they can bring more awareness to the disease and push for research toward finding treatments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willis retired from acting in 2022 after his aphasia diagnosis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aphasia typically occurs suddenly after a stroke, head injury or sometimes a slow-growing tumor. It can affect a person&rsquo;s ability to speak, write and understand language, both verbal and written, according to the Mayo Clinic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actor&rsquo;s former co-workers told the Los Angeles Times last year that he had been struggling for years on set.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Biden administrations&rsquo; zeal for shooting down balloons, they may have overreacted with this one&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/aircraft-propulsion/hobby-clubs-missing-balloon-feared-shot-down-usaf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/aircraft-propulsion/hobby-clubs-missing-balloon-feared-shot-down-usaf</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobby Club&rsquo;s Missing Balloon Feared Shot Down By USAF</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small, globe-trotting balloon declared &ldquo;missing in action&rdquo; by an Illinois-based hobbyist club on Feb. 15 has emerged as a candidate to explain one of the three mystery objects shot down by four heat-seeking missiles launched by U.S. Air Force fighters since Feb. 10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The club&mdash;the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade (NIBBB)&mdash;is not pointing fingers yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the circumstantial evidence is at least intriguing. The club&rsquo;s silver-coated, party-style, &ldquo;pico balloon&rdquo; reported its last position on Feb. 10 at 38,910 ft. off the west coast of Alaska, and a popular forecasting tool&mdash;the HYSPLIT model provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&mdash;projected the cylindrically shaped object would be floating high over the central part of the Yukon Territory on Feb. 11. That is the same day a Lockheed Martin F-22 shot down an unidentified object of a similar description and altitude in the same general area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are suspicions among other prominent members of the small, pico-ballooning enthusiasts&rsquo; community, which combines ham radio and high-altitude ballooning into a single, relatively affordable hobby.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/eu-2035-gas-car-ban"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/eu-2035-gas-car-ban</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Union approves effective ban on sales of gas cars by 2035, requiring 100% reduction in CO2</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Parliament has formally approved a law that will effectively end the sale of gas- and diesel-powered vehicles in the European Union by 2035, calling for a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions for any new cars sold, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 27-nation union agreed to the changes in October 2022, but has now formalized the deal, which enforces a 55% reduction in emissions for vehicles by 2030. Levels for CO2 for 2021 were set at a target of 37.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vans will get a slight advantage in the market, requiring a a 50% cut by 2030, compared with 2021 levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few months before the announcement in May 2022, car makers such as Ford and Volvo even signed a joint letter with 26 other companies asking the European Union to implement such a plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The target of 2035 has been justified by the EU based on what officials say is an average vehicle lifespan of 15 years, which would allow the EU to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that make less than 10,000 cars per year will be able to negotiate lower targets until 2036, however some companies are happily ready to enforce the change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen vowed in October 2022 to produce only electric cars in Europe beginning in 2033, committing to the earliest possible time frame after previously stating it would aim for a 2033-2035 range.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in June 2022, five countries were looking to delay the shift to electric-only vehicles by at least five years to 2040. Bulgaria, Italy, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia called for a 90% cut of CO2 by 2035, extending the 100% target to 2040, with light commercial vehicles meeting 80% for 2035 before also needing the full cut by 2040.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bulgarian official had said that the EU needed to reconsider the economic costs of switching to electric and the effect that would have on poorer nations in the union.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laws enforcing electric vehicle chargers are currently in negotiation in the union.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist China Cracked Down On Christians In 2022</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) censored, fined, politically indoctrinated and forcibly disappeared Chinese Christians in 2022, according to a new report from the nonprofit ChinaAid Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) reportedly employed a range of new methods to persecute Chinese Christians in 2022 including fabricating charges of fraud as well as criminalizing the legal international travel of church leaders, the report states. China&rsquo;s crackdown on Christianity reportedly intensified in the run-up to the CCP&rsquo;s 20th Party Congress in October 2022, during which time General Secretary Xi Jinping secured a third term as the communist nation&rsquo;s supreme leader, according to ChinaAid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Xi Jinping and the Communist Party did all they could to silence Christians leading up to the 20th National Congress,&rdquo; Jonathan Dingler, a spokesman for ChinaAid who worked on the report, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christians account for approximately 5% of China&rsquo;s religious community, according to the CIA World Factbook. While Catholics number around 10 million, Protestants account for the majority of China&rsquo;s Christian community, with approximately 38 million followers as of 2020, The Economist reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dingler told the DCNF that after the CCP&rsquo;s crackdown leading up to the 20th Party Congress &ldquo;the tone shifted&rdquo; within the state-sanctioned churches which then began treating Xi &ldquo;as if he were the leader of the church.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChinaAid identified a March 2022 paper entitled &ldquo;Adhering to the Sinicization of Religion in China&rdquo; published by the United Front Work Department (UFWD) as the political motivation behind the CCP&rsquo;s 2022 crackdown on Christianity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UFWD is a &ldquo;Chinese government entity charged with extending the CCP&rsquo;s influence and control over non-Party organizations both domestically and abroad to advance CCP policy objectives,&rdquo; according to a 2021 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC). Moreover, the USCC also identified the UFWD as a &ldquo;Chinese intelligence service&rdquo; in 2016.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UFWD&rsquo;s March 2022 paper reportedly emphasized &ldquo;promoting the Sinicization of religion, adhering to the orientation of the core socialist values and submerging all religious beliefs in Chinese culture to better adapt religion to China&rsquo;s socialist society and the New Era of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,&rdquo; according to ChinaAid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s state-sanctioned churches must now actively promote Xi&rsquo;s thoughts &ldquo;from the pulpit,&rdquo; which in practice means that churches which don&rsquo;t &ldquo;flat-out fall at Xi&rsquo;s feet and worship him are considered &lsquo;inciting subversion of state power,'&rdquo; Dingler told the DCNF.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churches were reportedly even converted into political propaganda centers in order to broadcast Xi&rsquo;s speech during the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, according to ChinaAid&rsquo;s report. Likewise, churches in other provinces were also reportedly repurposed to hold &ldquo;study&rdquo; sessions on CCP policies such as &ldquo;Reinforcing Management of Religion on All Fronts: 10 Prohibitions and 10 Mustn&rsquo;ts.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese government also increasingly persecuted Christians online in 2022, censoring words like &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Savior&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, according to ChinaAid&rsquo;s report. At the same time, the Chinese government also shut down church websites and Christians&rsquo; social media accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Congregants can&rsquo;t even give to their churches online anymore, thanks to new regulations,&rdquo; Dingler said. &ldquo;They want to break down house churches even further, hoping they will finally give in and submit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese Embassy did not respond to the DCNF&rsquo;s request for comment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffalo supermarket shooter sentenced to life in prison without parole</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffalo supermarket mass shooter Payton Gendron was sentenced to life in prison without parole on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and domestic terrorism, among other charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gendron killed 10 people in a racially motivated massacre in Buffalo, New York last year. He pleaded guilty to all 15 counts brought by Buffalo prosecutors.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Judge Blocks N.Y. Law Mandating Social Media 'Hateful Conduct' Policies</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge has blocked New York's new law that prohibits hate speech on social media, ruling the measure violates the Constitution's protection of free speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. on Tuesday, in Volokh v. James, sided with the Volokh Conspiracy legal blog and Peter Thiel-backed video site Rumble Inc., which claimed the law will hurt online services and silence disfavored viewpoints.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul in June signed a legislative package that included new regulations governing how social media platforms police what the law calls "hateful conduct."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The "Hateful Conduct Law" required that social media websites make it easy for users to report "incidents of hateful conduct," and to respond to complaints explaining how the matter is being handled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter began his ruling by citing the Supreme Court's 2017 Matal v. Tam decision in which the justices unanimously ruled that a federal law prohibiting trademark names that disparage others was unconstitutional because "speech may not be banned on the grounds that it expresses ideas that offend."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After calling the law "well-intentioned," Carter explained his decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Yet, the First Amendment protects from state regulation speech that may be deemed 'hateful' and generally disfavors regulation of speech based on its content unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest," Carter wrote in his decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Hateful Conduct Law both compels social media networks to speak about the contours of hate speech and chills the constitutionally protected speech of social media users, without articulating a compelling governmental interest or ensuring that the law is narrowly tailored to that goal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In the face of our national commitment to the free expression of speech, even where that speech is offensive or repugnant, Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, prohibiting enforcement of the law, is GRANTED."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter said the law overreached.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Hateful Conduct Law does not merely require that a social media network provide its users with a mechanism to complain about instances of 'hateful conduct,'" Carter wrote. "The law also requires that a social media network must make a &lsquo;policy&rsquo; available on its website which details how the network will respond to a complaint of hateful content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In other words, the law requires that social media networks devise and implement a written policy &mdash; i.e., speech."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secret China Donations to University of Delaware Soared After the Opening of the Biden Institute</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second university has been found to have received more than $6.7 million in anonymous donations from China, including direct funding from the Chinese government, after Joe Biden set up a program there in his name, according to a Government Accountability Institute analysis. The revelation comes following reporting that anonymous China-linked funds flowing to the University of Pennsylvania almost tripled after the inauguration of the Penn-Biden Center, which illegally housed classified documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 13, 2017, less than seven weeks after concluding his second term as vice president, Joe Biden announced the founding of the Biden Institute at his home state&rsquo;s University of Delaware (UD). According to the announcement, part of Biden&rsquo;s &ldquo;vision for the institute is an annual conference at UD, similar to the World Economic Forum or the Aspen Institute.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of Biden&rsquo;s announcement at UD, multiple members of the Biden family were working on deals worth millions of dollars with foreign businessmen linked to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence. And Biden&rsquo;s other university program at the University of Pennsylvania was apparently housing classified documents from the Obama-Biden administration in an improper way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to hosting the Biden Institute, UD had never disclosed any funding from China. One year later (and just two months after the Penn Biden center opened its D.C. office), anonymous donations from China to UD skyrocketed. The first payment came in April 2018 in the amount of $3,204,070 from an anonymous donor in China. In December 2018, another anonymous donation from China arrived for $1,869,515. A third anonymous China-linked payment, for $624,904, arrived in December 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the year that Biden was campaigning for president, anonymous Chinese state-linked entities sent three more payments totaling $1,005,761 to UD, the bulk of which arrived after Biden had been declared the president-elect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of these donations from China&mdash;with a combined total of $1,005,761&mdash;were reported as coming from a &ldquo;Foreign Government Source,&rdquo; according to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) records assembled from information reported to the DOE by the University of Delaware.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that, according to the available records, none the donations from China to the University of Pennsylvania following the creation of the Penn Biden Center appear to have been reported to the DOE as coming from a &ldquo;Foreign Government Source&rdquo; &mdash; a fact which led at least one fact-checker to conclude that the Penn Biden Center was being unfairly labeled as &ldquo;China-funded&rdquo; because the influx of funding from China to UPenn following its establishment was not given this DOE identifier. However, three donations originating from China to the University of Delaware in the years following the launch of the Biden Institute clearly bear the &ldquo;Foreign Government Source&rdquo; identifier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual DOE record field for this identifier asks, &ldquo;Is this funding from a government?&rdquo; For these three donations, the answer supplied by the University of Delaware is &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; as seen in the three images below taken from the DOE website (highlight added for emphasis).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither the Biden Institute nor the UD have responded to requests to identify the Chinese donors or explain why the Chinese government decided to fund UD after the Biden Institute was created.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Biden Institute is how it was conceived.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial idea for Biden Institute at UD was apparently hatched by Joe&rsquo;s son, Hunter Biden, while the elder Biden was still the vice president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2016, Hunter Biden met with UD&rsquo;s incoming president, Dr. Dennis Assanis, as Hunter and his business associates were making plans to create a &ldquo;stage&rdquo; to promote the &ldquo;Biden brand,&rdquo; emails from Hunter&rsquo;s abandoned laptop show. Other emails on the laptop indicate that Hunter and his business associates were concerned about boosting Joe&rsquo;s &ldquo;future earnings potential,&rdquo; while Joe was still the vice president.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota Bans Child Sex Changes</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem signed legislation Monday banning both surgical and nonsurgical sex change procedures for minors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &ldquo;Help Not Harm&rdquo; bill bars health care providers from prescribing minors puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones or performing cross-sex surgeries on minors. Doctors found violating the law will have their medical licenses revoked. The move comes amid a broader push from red states to crack down on the procedures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients harmed by violations of the new law have three years, or until they turn 25, to seek civil damages; whichever date is later, according to the bill. The legislation takes effect July 1, and health care professionals may keep patients on cross-sex drug regimens through the end of the year if they determine it&rsquo;s necessary to gradually wean them off the drugs for the sake of their health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cross-sex genital surgeries are rare for minors, numerous clinics and hospitals offer puberty blockers, hormones and mastectomies to minors as part of the gender transition process; the procedures are still legal at the federal level and in most states.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Wednesday, February 15th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/ohios-apocalyptic-chemical-disaster-rages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.zerohedge.com/political/ohios-apocalyptic-chemical-disaster-rages</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Get The Hell Out Of There" - Ohio's Chemical Disaster Rages On</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the US government is dispensing millions of dollars in resources to treat balloons as an existential crisis, a small town in Ohio finds itself engulfed in what actually looks like the apocalypse. Perhaps by design, all of the drama surrounding violations of US airspace by Chinese spy initiatives has done well to keep what is becoming one of the worst environmental disasters in recent memory from getting any headlines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chaos began early last week when a train of more than 100 cars derailed in East Palestine, Ohio near the state&rsquo;s border with Pennsylvania with roughly 5,000 residents. The accident launched fifty of those hundred freight cars from the tracks. Twenty of the freight cars on the train were carrying hazardous materials, ten of which were derailed. While the accident had no fatalities, of those ten cars, five contained pressurized vinyl chloride, a highly flammable carcinogenic gas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DHiXZUgQEwc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/DHiXZUgQEwc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to address the volatile scenario around the crash site, the Ohio Emergency Management Agency executed its plan of venting the toxic gas with a controlled burn in order to evade an uncontrolled explosion which presented the risk of catastrophic damage. &ldquo;Within the last two hours, a drastic temperature change has taken place in a rail car, and there is now the potential of a catastrophic tanker failure which could cause an explosion with the potential of deadly shrapnel traveling up to a mile,&rdquo; Gov. Mike DeWine warned in statement explaining the decision to take action to avert widespread devastation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that operation sent large plumes of smoke containing vinyl chloride, phosgene, hydrogen chloride, and other gases into the air as the flames from the controlled burn raged on for days. Phosgene in particular is a highly toxic gas that can cause vomiting and respiratory trouble. The toxicity of phosgene gas is so potent that it was previously used as a chemical weapon during the First World War.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1625155991724605440"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1625155991724605440</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hazardous airborne chemicals prompted officials to issue mandatory evacuation and shelter-in-place orders within a one-mile radius of where the train derailed. Those orders forced nearly 2,000 residents of East Palestine out of their homes. Despite the public safety risk in proximity to the crash site, over 500 people within the parameters of the evacuation order refused to leave their homes. However, those orders were lifted on February 8th, allowing residents to return to the area adjacent to the disaster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead fish are being pulled from rivers outside East Palestine, Ohio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trucks doing the work are labeled EnviroScience, an Ohio-based company that provides "time-sensitive solutions to environmental challenges."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1625214717945057282"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1625214717945057282</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Breshears found her chickens dead ten miles from East Palestine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1625214716443504641"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1625214716443504641</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holzer&rsquo;s concerns were echoed by reports from other residents who described similar conditions near their own properties. One of those residents was Katlyn Schwarzwaelder, the operator of a local dog kennel in nearby Darlington, Pennsylvania. The catastrophe caused her to leave her home despite the fact that it lies more than 10 miles away from the site of the controlled burn. After fleeing to Boardman, Ohio, 15 miles away from the derailment, Schwarzwaelder stated she received multiple reports of dead chickens, fish, and other animals from friends and acquaintances. One affected resident told Schwarzwaelder that they let their 2-year old dog out to use the bathroom only for it never to return. When they embarked upon a search for their missing pet, they found it dead in their yard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testimony from Holzer, Schwarzwaelder, and others paints a drastically different picture than the official narrative tailored by officials who assured residents that the situation was under control. The poor air quality presents short and long term health risks to the public considering the carcinogenic effects of the chemicals. Carcinogens like vinyl chloride can cause cancer in organs including the liver, according to Kevin Crist, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering who also serves as the Director of Ohio University&rsquo;s Air Quality Center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magnitude of this story has been seemingly scrubbed from the public view as national media outlets continue to run sensationalist headlines about issues that look innocuous in comparison. It is an instance of history being rewritten in real time, setting a precedent that would allow victims of other widespread devastation to be swept under the rug. However, the scenes of the horror engulfing this small town in America&rsquo;s heartland may prove to make this disaster impossible to ignore, rightfully putting the spotlight on the shortcomings of state and federal agencies tasked with emergency response management whose continued lack of accountability enables them to fail the American public time and time again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I move on, I want to remind everyone, that the federal government isn&rsquo;t who we should be relying on. All their authority was granted by our creator. It&rsquo;s our Lord and savior Jesus Christ who our faith must lie upon. So we take our prayer requests about Ohio to our Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US to Sell 26 Million More Barrels From Strategic Oil Reserve</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration plans to sell more crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, fulfilling budget directives mandated years ago that it had sought to stop as oil prices have stabilized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The congressionally mandated sale will amount to 26 million barrels of crude, according to people familiar with the matter. The sale is in accordance with a budget mandate enacted in 2015 for the current fiscal year, said a spokesperson for the Department of Energy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Energy Department has sought to stop some of the sales required by 2015 legislation so that it can refill the emergency reserve, which currently has about 371 million barrels. After this latest release, the reserve will dip to about 345 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden officials decided last year to tap 180 million barrels from the strategic reserve in an effort to ease supply issues after Russia invaded Ukraine, upending global oil flows and sending crude above $100 a barrel. Some Republicans have criticized the Biden administration for that drawdown, which was the biggest release ever and helped drain the SPR to its lowest level since 1983. Critics admonished the move as a political stunt intended to combat rising gasoline prices ahead of midterm elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden officials have since spoken with energy companies about purchasing oil to refill the SPR when prices approach $70 a barrel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest release comes after Russia unveiled plans to curtail production by half-a-million barrels a day next month to retaliate against sanctions. Russia&rsquo;s move, which was downplayed by the European Union, follows China&rsquo;s rapid economic reopening with the scrapping of Covid-19 restrictions. The SPR release may give pause to the OPEC+ alliance, which earlier said that global oil markets remain balanced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how did the market react?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US House last month passed legislation meant to curb the Energy secretary&rsquo;s ability to use the reserve unless the government increases the amount of federal lands available for gas and oil drilling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other congressionally required releases &mdash; about 140 million barrels slated for fiscal years 2024 through 2027 &mdash; were canceled at the Energy Department&rsquo;s behest after lawmakers in December approved a provision in a giant spending bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark for crude, fell 1% to trade near $79 a barrel after the announcement of more barrels.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspect in Michigan State University shooting found dead from self-inflicted gunshot, at least 3 people killed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suspect in the Michigan State University shooting was found dead off campus late Monday night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSU Police Interim Deputy Chief Chris Rozman said, &ldquo;There is no longer a threat on campus and the shelter-in-place has been lifted.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police had earlier described the suspect as a "black male, shorter in stature, red shoes, jean jacket, wearing a baseball cap that is navy with a lighter brim." Rozman said the deceased individual matched the description of the suspect but did not reveal the suspect's identity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a press conference late Monday night, Rozman said 3 people had been killed and 5 have been hospitalized. The victims, some in critical condition, were transported to Sparrow Hospital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police responded to reports of an active shooting at Michigan State University in East Lansing Monday night and students were ordered to shelter in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident took place at 8:18 pm inside Berkey Hall the location of MSU's Department of Sociology on the northern boundary of the campus. The shelter-in-place order went out at 8:31 pm telling students to stay inside and barricade themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Run, Hide, Fight. Run means evacuate away from danger if you can do so safely, Hide means to secure-in-place, and Fight means protect yourself if no other option," MSU said in the alert.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to authorities, the suspect walked to the MSU Union, approximately 19 minutes away from the initial shooting site and opened fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of officers from the FBI, ATF, Michigan State Police, and other agencies are still assisting on campus. All campus activities have been canceled for 48 hours and authorities have asked people not to come to the campus on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that was some heavy subject matter, so let&rsquo;s go ahead and end with this&hellip; this is the fight laugh feast network afterall!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/14/man-facing-jail-over-theft-of-almost-200000-cadbury-creme-eggs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/14/man-facing-jail-over-theft-of-almost-200000-cadbury-creme-eggs</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man facing jail over theft of almost 200,000 Cadbury Creme Eggs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chocolate thief is facing jail after admitting he stole almost 200,000 Cadbury Creme Eggs in a heist worth more than &pound;31,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joby Pool, 32, dubbed &ldquo;the Easter bunny&rdquo; by police, used a stolen lorry cab to make off with chocolate after breaking into a Telford industrial unit with a metal grinder on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is expected to be jailed for about two years next month, after pleading guilty to theft and criminal damage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening the facts of the case on Tuesday, prosecutor Owen Beale told Kidderminster magistrates court: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you have seen the news recently &ndash; there was a load that was stolen and on the trailer was Cadbury&rsquo;s products, a large number of Creme Eggs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said Pool, a self-employed ground worker, used a tractor unit that had been stolen in the Yorkshire area in October to tow away the trailer full of chocolate, which was then driven away, eventually reaching the northbound M42.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pool was spotted by police and &ldquo;gave up at junction 11 and walked towards the police with his hands up. He was arrested and the load was recovered&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This clearly wasn&rsquo;t spur-of-the-moment offending, if I can put it like that, because he had taken with him a tractor unit and he had to know that the load was there in the first place,&rdquo; said Beale.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magistrates were told Pool, from West Yorkshire, was previously convicted of theft, handling stolen goods and driving while disqualified in 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beale said: &ldquo;This is clearly an organised criminal matter. You don&rsquo;t just happen to learn about a trailer with that kind of value being available.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defence solicitor John McMillan, told the court that Pool understood a substantial sentence was likely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a series of tweets on Monday, West Mercia police described the incident as an &ldquo;eggs-travagent theft&rdquo; of a &ldquo;chocolate collection box&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Shortly after the theft a vehicle, presumably purporting to be the Easter bunny, was stopped northbound on the M42 and a man was arrested on suspicion of theft,&rdquo; they said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pool will be sentenced at Shrewsbury crown court on 14 March.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China claims US sent more than 10 spy balloons into country's airspace</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a Chinese official stated that more than 10 high-altitude balloons from the US have flown into China&rsquo;s airspace over the last year without the country&rsquo;s permission. The US has denied these allegations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a Monday briefing that "It is also common for US balloons to illegally enter the airspace of other countries. Since last year, US high-altitude balloons have illegally flown over China&rsquo;s airspace more than 10 times without the approval of Chinese authorities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v29bau8-rep.-mike-waltz-i-hope-this-wakes-the-country-up-to-the-cold-war-that-were-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v29bau8-rep.-mike-waltz-i-hope-this-wakes-the-country-up-to-the-cold-war-that-were-.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Associated Press, Wang did not give additional details about the alleged US balloons, how China has dealt with these balloons, or whether the balloons had military or government links.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang said the US should "first reflect on itself and change course, rather than smear and instigate a confrontation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegation came after the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon that traveled across North America, targeting it off the coast of South Carolina. Additional unidentified flying objects later identified as balloons have been shot down since then.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China has claimed that the balloon shot down off the coast of South Carolina was an unnamed airship created for meteorological research, and that this balloon was blown off course.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China has accused the US of overreacting by shooting down the balloon, and has threatened to take action in response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on Monday that claims the US has operated surveillance balloons over China is false.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/microsoft-newsmax-conservative-media/2023/02/13/id/1108447/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/microsoft-newsmax-conservative-media/2023/02/13/id/1108447/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Removes 'Negative Flags' for Conservative Sites</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft removed its "negative flags" for conservative media outlets on a "secret blacklist," including Newsmax, that were blocked from getting key advertising dollars, the Washington Examiner reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its series on "disinformation" tracking groups, the Examiner reported internal data showed Microsoft was doing a review, and suspending its subscription to a tracking group devoted to defunding what it sees as "disfavored speech."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft-owned advertising company Xandr previously abided by a "secret blacklist" of conservative news put together by the Global Disinformation Index, a British organization with two affiliated U.S. nonprofits, the Examiner reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft now appears to be taking steps to distance itself from GDI, and has deleted flags such as "false/misleading" and "reprehensible/offensive" for right-leaning websites, the Examiner reported, citing the internal data it obtained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I just checked in Xandr's platform again and can confirm that all rejection flags have been removed from domains," an unnamed executive in the ad industry told the Examiner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xandr had labeled 39 conservative domains as "false/misleading." Townhall, whose publisher is Salem Media Group, was flagged as "reprehensible/offensive," the Examiner reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Examiner also noted it was among those flagged as "false/misleading," along with Newsmax, the Daily Wire, RealClearPolitics, Drudge Report, Breitbart, the Blaze, the Washington Times, Judicial Watch, and the Media Research Center affiliate MRC.TV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An internal Xandr dataset showed all those websites no longer have a designation, though it's unclear if they are getting ads from certain brands without an "approved" classification.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We try to take a principled approach to accuracy and fighting foreign propaganda," a Microsoft spokesperson told the Examiner. "We're working quickly to fix the issue, and Xandr has stopped using GDI's services while we are doing a larger review."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Examiner, Xandr informed publishers in September 2022 it would begin to adopt GDI's "dynamic exclusion list," which the organization feeds to ad companies. Through a list that may include at least 2,000 websites, GDI allegedly tried to pressure companies to shut down certain sites.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Examiner also reported the GDI has claimed the 10 "riskiest" outlets are Newsmax, the American Spectator, the Federalist, the American Conservative, One America News Network, the Blaze, the Daily Wire, RealClearPolitics, Reason, and the New York Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDI compiles the list with oversight from its own "advisory panel," which includes Ben Nimmo, global lead for threat intelligence at Facebook parent company Meta, and left-leaning journalist Anne Applebaum, the Examiner reported, who once dismissed Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings as uninteresting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDI has claimed the 10 "least risky" websites are NPR, ProPublica, the Associated Press, Insider, the New York Times, USA Today, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News, HuffPost, and the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/disney-reedy-creek-ron-desantis-no-lawsuit-1235520205/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/disney-reedy-creek-ron-desantis-no-lawsuit-1235520205/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney Will Not Fight DeSantis Takeover of Special District in Orlando</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney will not fight a bill that gives Gov. Ron DeSantis broad powers over its Orlando theme parks, after the bill passed both houses of the Florida Legislature this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill establishes a new district to assume the powers held by the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which Disney has controlled since it was created in 1967. The new entity, the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, will be run by a five-member board appointed by DeSantis and confirmed by the state Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Disney said it is &ldquo;ready to work within this new framework,&rdquo; indicating that it will not try to challenge the law in court. The Legislature moved to dissolve the Reedy Creek district last April, after Disney came out against the Parental Rights in Education law, known to its critics as the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Say Gay&rdquo; bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some observers had suggested that Disney could file a First Amendment lawsuit or seek to challenge the takeover on various other grounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Jeff Vahle, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, said in the statement released on Friday that the company will accommodate itself to the new reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For more than 50 years, the Reedy Creek Improvement District has operated at the highest standards, and we appreciate all that the District has done to help our destination grow and become one of the largest economic contributors and employers in the state,&rdquo; Vahle said. &ldquo;We are focused on the future and are ready to work within this new framework and we will continue to innovate, inspire and bring joy to the millions of guests who come to Florida to visit Walt Disney World each year.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation was introduced on Monday. It passed the state House of Representatives on Thursday on a vote of 82-31, with 81 Republicans and one Democrat voting &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; All 31 &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes came from Democrats. The state Senate approved the bill on Friday on a party-line vote, with 26 Republicans in favor and nine Democrats opposed. It now goes to DeSantis for his signature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reedy Creek Improvement District has broad authority over zoning, infrastructure, fire response and public utilities over a nearly 40-square-mile area in Osceola and Orange counties. The entity levies taxes on Disney and issues tax-exempt bonds for infrastructure projects. As by far the largest landowner within the district, Disney has had the power to elect the five members of the Board of Supervisors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In establishing the new district, the Legislature left almost all of its powers intact. The legislation does remove the power to build a nuclear power plant and an airport, but those powers had never been used.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The practical effect of the change could end up being negligible and park employees and visitors are unlikely to notice any difference. But DeSantis and future governors will have broad power to make life difficult for Disney if they choose to exercise it.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/seattle-public-schools-consider-closures-student-enrollment-plunges-post"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/seattle-public-schools-consider-closures-student-enrollment-plunges-post</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Public Schools consider closures as student enrollment plunges post-pandemic</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Public Schools may have to close some of its schools over the next few years as the district battles budget shortages and plummeting enrollment after the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district does not plan on closing any of its 106 schools next year, and the earliest closures may occur in the 2024-2025 school year, The Seattle Times reported last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidating some schools for the 2024-2025 year could save $28 million as the district projects a $92 million budget shortfall that year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student enrollment has dropped to roughly 50,000 students from nearly 54,000 in the 2019-2020 school year. In a best-case scenario, school administrators expect 49,000 students by 2032, and in a worst-case scenario, enrollment may be as low as 43,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The declining enrollment comes after homeschooling rates nearly doubled in Washington at the height of the COVID pandemic and are still at elevated levels from the 2019-2020 school year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jen Garrison Stuber of the Washington Homeschool Organization told Fox News that homeschool enrollment is down, however, in Seattle from pre-pandemic numbers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I really think that what Seattle's seeing, where those students have gone are either to private schools or they've left the school district and have moved elsewhere," she said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-politician-suggests-fix-states-brazen-prostitution-legalize-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-politician-suggests-fix-states-brazen-prostitution-legalize-it</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California politician suggests fix to state's brazen prostitution: Legalize it</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A San Francisco County leader voiced support to legalize prostitution in the city as brazen soliciting spirals across the state after a new law took effect this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What&rsquo;s happening right now on Capp Street is it&rsquo;s become more brazen, and bigger than we&rsquo;ve ever seen it before," county Supervisor Hillary Ronen told The Los Angeles Times last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Instead of repeating the same cycle that we&rsquo;ve repeated for decades, it&rsquo;s time to try something new."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ronen called the situation "out of control" in comments to the San Francisco Chronicle, and pushed for San Francisco to install barriers on Capp Street in the heart of San Francisco&rsquo;s Mission District, after it became lined with prostitutes and pimps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, she is expected to announce a resolution that will urge state lawmakers to legalize prostitution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surge in prostitution and apparent human trafficking in California comes after a change in law took effect last month that repealed a ban on loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. The bill's sponsor, Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, argued the change would protect transgender women whom he said are disproportionately targeted by police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police and Republicans in the state have since sounded off that the new law sparked prostitution to explode in certain areas of the state, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said with the emboldened prostitution rings come robberies, shootings, aggravated assaults and other crimes. Many of the pimps are gang-affiliated and take no issue with beating women or going after rival pimps who try to poach one of the workers, they said. Some even record the beatdowns because they "think it&rsquo;s funny," police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Coalition to Abolish Slavery &amp; Trafficking, which is one of the largest and oldest direct service providers for sex and labor trafficking survivors in the U.S., threw its support behind the bill and told Fox News Digital that it endorsed repealing the former policy "because we know that reducing the criminalization of survivors will help prevent human trafficking."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now finally&hellip; it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you missed it, Sunday evening, the superbowl took place, with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game was an incredible one with highlight play after highlight play, with both teams putting up points:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWkt79xkd00"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWkt79xkd00</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 2:30-2:37</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 3:47-3:57</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 4:44-4:55</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 12:25-12:36</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 14:24-15:01</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay&hellip; so for those keeping score at home, it&rsquo;s 35-35 at this point in the game, with just a few minutes left. Then, this happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 15:45-16:52</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What an anti-climactic ending&hellip; if you&rsquo;re the official, how on earth do you throw that flag? James Bradbury, the cornerback for the Eagles who had the flag thrown on him, thought it was the correct call, so kudos to him for owning up, but even with that admission, the ball was clearly uncatchable for JuJu Smith-Schuster&hellip; Now the Chiefs still would have likely taken the lead with a field goal, but then Jalen Hurts and the Eagles offense would&rsquo;ve had over a minute to get down the field, and potentially tie, or win the game. Such an anti-climactic ending. This is from a guy who didn&rsquo;t have a dog in the fight by the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">what are your guys thoughts on my take? You Eagles fans can send your fan mail to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garrison@fightlaughfeast.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump REINSTATED on Facebook, Instagram</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Meta reinstated former President Donald Trump on their Facebook and Instagram social media platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta announced in January that it intended to reinstate Trump's accounts, a full two years after they claimed he was suspended for violating their terms of service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v274pzq-meta-president-for-global-affairs-nick-clegg-on-trumps-reinstatement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v274pzq-meta-president-for-global-affairs-nick-clegg-on-trumps-reinstatement.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg wrote in a statement, "Two years ago, we took action in what were extreme and highly unusual circumstances. We indefinitely suspended then-US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Facebook and Instagram accounts following his praise for people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Facebook, Trump's last post was from January 6 and reads, "I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law &amp; Order &ndash; respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being removed from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter Trump created his own social media network, Truth Social, and has not yet become active on the sites that have reinstated him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepoliticalinsider.com/non-binary-god-the-church-of-england-considers-making-language-in-scripture-gender-neutral/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepoliticalinsider.com/non-binary-god-the-church-of-england-considers-making-language-in-scripture-gender-neutral/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the name of the Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit&hellip;Amen; At least it is for now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Church of England is studying and deliberating on possibly changing the language of scripture to be gender-neutral.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welby's Church of England will begin using pronouns that are "gender neutral" in reference to God.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When referring to God in some prayers, the male pronouns 'He' and 'Him' will be eliminated, and the phrase "our Father" will be omitted from the beginning of the Lord's Prayer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument that God shouldn&rsquo;t be referred to in masculine terms is not new. One only has to remember the 1999 movie &lsquo;Dogma&rsquo; starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as fallen angels that depicted God as a woman played by not-ironic at-all Alanis Morrissette.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An argument by many on the left side of this argument claim that referring to God as exclusively male is what drives a lot of discrimination and sexism against women. Add to that the recent surge in gender ideology that you can identify as any number of over 50 genders; the scripture gets even more complicated for the left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this societal fad, Rev. Joanna Stobart from the Diocese of Bath and Wells has asked the Church of England to &ldquo;develop more inclusive language in our authorized liturgy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reverend is asking the Church to &ldquo;provide more options for those who wish to use authorized liturgy and speak of God in a non-gendered way, particularly, in authorized absolutions where many of the prayers offered for use refer to God using male pronouns.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not everyone sees this issue the same way, thank God.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri votes against banning children from carrying guns in public</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican-led Missouri state house on Wednesday voted against banning minors from openly carrying firearms on public land without adult supervision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal to ban children from carrying guns without adult supervision in public failed by a 104-39 vote. Only one Republican voted in support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Democrat, Donna Baringer, said police in her district asked for the change to stop &ldquo;14-year-olds walking down the middle of the street in the city of St Louis carrying AR-15s&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Missouri lawmakers repealed concealed carry requirements in most situations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure was part of an hours-long debate on the best way to fight crime, particularly in the St Louis area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Lane Roberts &ndash; a former Joplin, Missouri, police chief and state public safety director &ndash; initially included the restrictions on children possessing guns in a broader crime bill, which the House voted to give initial approval. But lawmakers on a House committee that Roberts leads stripped the provision on guns last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other provisions in the measure would allow the governor to appoint a special prosecutor in counties with high crime rates, a provision targeted at the St Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans for years have criticized Gardner, a 47-year-old Democrat first elected in 2016 as St Louis&rsquo;s first Black female prosecutor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is one of several progressive prosecutors elected in recent years with a focus on creating more fairness in the criminal justice system. Republicans say she is not doing enough to fight crime.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Gaetz Introduces Resolution to END Financial Aid to Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution also calls for a peace agreement after almost a year-long war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaetz and ten co-sponsors introduced the &ldquo;Ukraine Fatigue Resolution,&rdquo; which calls for the U.S. to &ldquo;end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Fox News reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution notes that since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort, with more than $110 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally. It includes more than $27.4 billion in security assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Daily Fetched reported last month, the total amount of military aid provided to Kyiv from the United States has soared past $26 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, Antony Blinken announced a further $2.5 billion in military aid for Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the $2.5 billion for Ukraine, congress already awarded $45 billion to the country in the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill, which was signed into law in December 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,&rdquo; Biden said, making that announcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News also notes that the resolution lists the enormous amount of equipment that the U.S. has provided to the country since the beginning of the conflict. It also cites Pentagon officials who have said the munitions have &ldquo;severely depleted United States stockpiles, weakening United States readiness in the event of conflict.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also claims that by providing assistance, the U.S. is inadvertently contributing to civilian casualties, and notes the U.S. estimates that 40,000 civilians had died in the conflict.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concern about the continued U.S. funding of the war has grown among a subset of Republicans as the conflict has dragged on, with lawmakers highlighting issues at home that could use additional funding &ndash; including what they see as a failure to protect the U.S. border against a historic migrant crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Gaetz said the U.S. has been the top contributor to an &ldquo;everlasting conflict.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-wants-downed-spy-aircraft-back-does-not-belong-to-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-wants-downed-spy-aircraft-back-does-not-belong-to-us</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China wants its downed spy aircraft back, saying it 'does not belong to the US'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People's Republic of China is requesting the return of its surveillance aircraft after the balloon was shot down over the continental United States on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning fielded questions Tuesday about the incident, which dominated news cycles and commanded attention from U.S. politicians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked for additional information regarding the purpose of the spy balloon and reports of similar aircraft making routes through North American and South American airspace, Mao declined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Chinese side has given information about the unmanned airship on several occasions. I don&rsquo;t have anything to add at the moment," she stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon said it "acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information" from the spy platform. But geopolitical experts said there is little reason to believe those efforts were successful as the balloon almost certainly transferred surveillance data over to China as it flew over several military bases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if China has requested that the debris from the destroyed aircraft be returned, Mao said Tuesday, "The airship does not belong to the U.S. It belongs to China."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mao reiterated in her Tuesday press conference the Chinese Communist Party's claim that the balloon was civilian in nature and criticized the U.S. government for not acting in a "calm and professional manner."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://contra.substack.com/p/us-led-west-opposed-peace-deal-in?r=lj90&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_campaign=post"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://contra.substack.com/p/us-led-west-opposed-peace-deal-in?r=lj90&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_campaign=post</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S.-Led West Opposed Peace Deal in Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naftali Bennett, then the prime minister of Israel, found himself praying aboard a cramped, decrepit plane last year as it sailed over Kazakhstan. The long flight, arranged with help from the Mossad, was bound for Moscow on a desperate mission: broker peace between Russia and Ukraine just after the two countries had gone to war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bennett, Russian President Vladimir Putin made two major concessions during their March 5 meeting. First, he renounced &ldquo;denazification&rdquo;&mdash;that is, regime change in Kiev. Second, he dropped his demand for Ukraine&rsquo;s demilitarization. Bennett said President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to abandon Ukraine&rsquo;s pursuit of NATO membership in exchange. Both Putin and Zelensky seemed eager to end the fighting. But the U.S. had other plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett said a &ldquo;decision by the West&rdquo; was made &ldquo;to keep striking Putin&rdquo; through Ukraine. &ldquo;They blocked it and I thought they were wrong,&rdquo; he said. Bennett noted that the governments of Germany and France were pragmatic toward the idea compared to the U.S. and the U.K., which took a more belligerent attitude against Russia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the U.K. is little more than a neutered lapdog of D.C., it is more than likely that it was the U.S. who decided to keep the war going. Indeed, Bennett said he deferred &ldquo;to America in this regard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with author and comedian Hanoch Daum, Bennett provided a behind-the-scenes look at his efforts to establish a ceasefire and how it initially showed promise until being doomed by imperial intrigue. It was the first time time he talked about his attempt to mediate peace between the two countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His solution was &ldquo;creating contact with both sides and trying to mediate,&rdquo; leveraging his good relations with Putin and Zelensky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett maintained contact with the governments of Germany, France, the U.K., and the U.S. throughout the negotiations, keeping them appraised as talks, mostly by phone, progressed. While Putin was open to diplomacy, the U.S. was not, according to Bennett.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett described Putin as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Messianic&rdquo; but governed by limited, concrete objectives, contra the Western portrait of him as a madman bent on world domination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putin does not think of himself as an imperialist, Bennett said, but as someone fighting against imperialism in the form of NATO expansionism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone, maybe Mark Twain, said that history doesn&rsquo;t repeat, but it does rhyme. What Bennett revealed is a reminder that the U.S. has been calling the war tune for decades.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Sues Biden Admin Over &lsquo;Pharmacy Mandate&rsquo; to Dispense Abortion Drugs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration on Tuesday to block federal health guidance that allegedly forces pharmacies to dispense abortion-inducing drugs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration in July 2022 released guidance requiring pharmacies to supply women with abortion-inducing drugs or risk losing Medicaid and Medicare funds, even if certain state laws prohibit the procedure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas argues in its lawsuit, which refers to the guidance collectively as the &ldquo;pharmacy mandate,&rdquo; that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has attempted to impose, via executive fiat, a federal right to abortion. The lawsuit said this was a part of the Biden administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;war against&rdquo; the Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health decision. That ruling reversed a 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;But whether the Biden Administration likes it or not, the question of abortion is up to the people&rsquo;s elected representatives&mdash;not unelected bureaucrats,&rdquo; the lawsuit states (pdf). &ldquo;The Biden Administration&rsquo;s attempt to inject itself into that question is both procedurally and substantively illegal.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HHS guidance, which involved roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies, claims that federal anti-discrimination law requires pharmacies to provide these drugs. The guidance was released on July 13, 2022, a few days after President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed an executive order that made it easier to obtain abortion services following the Dobbs decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, argues that Title IX&rsquo;s anti-discrimination protections don&rsquo;t require companies to provide abortions, and instead protect any person or entity from being forced to aid in the provision of abortions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Paxton&rsquo;s office, the alleged HHS assertion that federal anti-discrimination law mandates every pharmacy to provide abortion drugs is &ldquo;patently false.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxton further argues that the Supreme Court returned the power to decide on abortion law back to the states, instead of the federal government. The &ldquo;pharmacy mandate,&rdquo; therefore, preempts certain state laws, which prohibit pharmacies from providing abortion-inducing drugs, and goes against the Dobbs decision, according to Paxton.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original copy of the HHS guidance document published in July 2022 is not currently available on the department&rsquo;s website, but a version archived on Jan. 23, 2023 can still be accessed (pdf).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance reminds approximately 60,000 retail pharmacies and their employees of their obligation &ldquo;under federal civil rights laws&rdquo; to ensure access to prescription medication.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HHS said in the guidance that among its civil rights enforcement responsibilities, its Office for Civil Rights is responsible for &ldquo;protecting the rights of women and pregnant people in their ability to access care that is free from discrimination.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of discrimination include denying a prescription for medication to assist with a miscarriage and denying medication for a disability, according to the guidance.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could Chicago be about to elect a pro-life, pro-cop Democratic mayor?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago&rsquo;s next mayoral election is quickly approaching, scheduled for the 28th of this month. Most of the polls indicate that the incumbent mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is not doing well and she might not be given another term. That wouldn&rsquo;t be a terribly surprising result, given the soaring crime rates and the generally decrepit state of the Windy City these days. If that&rsquo;s the case, who will replace her? Interestingly enough, one of the current frontrunners is a man named Paul Vallas. What makes him unique among Chicago Democrats is his history of being opposed to abortion and his promises to crack down on crime. But can someone like that really be elected in a liberal stronghold? (ABC7 Chicago)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago mayoral candidates are touting dueling endorsements as Paul Vallas comes under fire for his Democratic credentials and past statements opposing abortion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several recent polls suggest Vallas is one of the frontrunners in the mayor&rsquo;s race, so it&rsquo;s no surprise he&rsquo;s coming under attack, but it&rsquo;s also an indication that this race will be rough and tumble in its final three weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the other candidates, Jesus &ldquo;Chuy&rdquo; Garcia, has been running attack ads against Vallas. He dug up a clip from some years ago where Vallas describes himself as &ldquo;more of a Republican than a Democrat&rdquo; and saying that he&rsquo;s personally opposed to abortion. Garcia is accusing him of not being a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Democrat and claims that Vallas would be &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; for Chicago. Really? More dangerous than, say&hellip; stopping your car at a red light for more than ten seconds?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vallas has now received the endorsement of both the Chicago Tribune and the Fraternal Order of Police, which is rather remarkable. The Chicago Sun-Times has run a number of articles on this Vallas, listing all of the progressive liberals who are losing their minds about him. They&rsquo;re accusing him of having trodden upon the rights of workers in previous positions he&rsquo;s held and wanting to outlaw abortions. There are probably a couple of them calling him a satan worshipper by now. In other words, all of the right people hate him.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Turkey, at least 5,434 people are confirmed dead. In Syria, state news agency SANA reported at least 1,832 deaths. Combined, at least 7,266 people have died in Turkey and Syria.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, at least 3,749 people are estimated to have been injured in Syria. Turkey&rsquo;s injured are estimated to be over 30,000. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the death toll could rise to around 20,000 in the coming days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quake, with an epicenter in the Pazarcik district of Turkey&rsquo;s southern Province, had a magnitude of 7.8. A second quake of 7.6 magnitude hit the same region nine hours later, worsening the situation. Turkey experienced 285 aftershocks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. President Joe Biden &ldquo;noted that U.S. teams are deploying quickly to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and coordinate other assistance that may be required by people affected by the earthquakes, including health services or basic relief items,&rdquo; a readout of Biden&rsquo;s conversation with Turkish President on Jan. 6 said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earthquakes have caused widespread devastation in Turkey. A video shared on Twitter shows innumerable buildings turned to rubble, with only a few tall buildings still standing. Another video shows a building crashing down while people run for safety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Turkey&rsquo;s southern region, which is home to some of the worst-hit cities, damaged roads and poor internet connections are hampering rescue attempts. In some places, freezing winter weather is also posing a challenge. Families were forced to sleep in cars lined up in the streets. Families wrapped themselves in blankets and gathered around fires to keep themselves warm. The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency of Turkey (AFAD) is said to have deployed 13,740 search and rescue personnel as well as over 300,000 blankets, 100,000 beds, and 41,000 tents to the region. According to Organ Tatar, an official from AFAD, 5,775 buildings have been destroyed by the quake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The infrastructure is damaged, the roads that we used to use for humanitarian work are damaged, we have to be creative in how to get to the people &hellip;&nbsp; but we are working hard,&rdquo; U.N. resident coordinator&nbsp; -told Reuters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earthquake on Monday is Turkey&rsquo;s deadliest since a quake of similar magnitude hit the country in 1999 and killed over 17,000 people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massive Human Trafficking Bust Sees 368 Arrested, 131 Rescued in California</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three hundred sixty-eight people have been arrested, and 131 victims rescued in large-scale human trafficking operation by a multi-agency task force in California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Michel Moore said: &ldquo;We know that the sex trade is a prolific one that exists throughout this state and throughout our nation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ugly scar against this great country that exists too oftentimes in plain sight,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Reclaim and Rebuild occurred between Jan. 22 and Jan. 28 in nine counties, including Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino, Kiro7 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies teamed up for the effort, including the LAPD, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victims of human trafficking, including ages ranging from 13 to 52, including children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators worked with victim advocacy groups to provide resources &ldquo;to help [victims] escape from this life-threatening environment,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators responded to advertisements offering sexual services and visited massage parlors suspected of being involved in sex trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those arrested included pimps and panderers, Moore said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victims, most of whom were kidnapped, face &ldquo;threat of death&rdquo; or coercion and are isolated from their former support to become dependent on the trafficker, Moore added.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/death-tourism-oregon-becomes-national-destination-for-assisted-suicide?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/death-tourism-oregon-becomes-national-destination-for-assisted-suicide?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Death tourism': Oregon becomes national destination for assisted suicide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals residing in states that outlaw euthanasia, such as Texas, have started traveling to Oregon to gain assistance in their suicide, making the state the first "death tourism" destination in the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, Dr. Nicholas Gideonse, the director of End of Life Choices Oregon, recently admitted to assisting a man from Texas with Lou Gehrig's disease who came to the doctor's Portland clinic in achieving suicide and said that "for a small number of patients who otherwise qualify or are determined to go through that and who have the energy and the resources &hellip; it has started to happen."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Oregon's official website, the state passed its Death with Dignity Act in 1997, "which allows terminally ill individuals to end their lives through the voluntary self-administration of lethal medications, expressly prescribed by a physician for that purpose." The law enabled terminally ill patients expected to die within six months to request fatal drugs from doctors that the patient then takes and self-administers. In 2021, 238 people committed suicide via the program, and 383 doses of fatal drugs were prescribed by doctors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was originally a restriction for people out-of-state but in 2021 Dr. Gideonse sued Oregon to lift the restriction, which was granted in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, if a resident from another state wants to go to Oregon for the fatal drugs, they are placed on a 15-day waiting period. In that time paperwork is processed and two doctors along with witnesses must sign off on the request for suicide by prescription. The expansion of Death with Dignity to out-of-staters is not yet law in Oregon but is expected to be codified this year with House Bill 2279.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law resembles Canada's state-sponsored euthanasia program known as medical assistance in dying (MAiD), originally intended for those with physical illnesses where death was a reasonable inevitability although it has been amended to allow those with mental health issues to apply.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gideonse's original lawsuit was over neighboring residents of Washington who wanted suicide drugs and has expanded to residents from further states, including those with strict laws against euthanasia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive director of the Patients Rights Action Fund, a group pushing back against Oregon's law, Matt Valli&egrave;re, said "You end up in this Wild West scenario where people take the drugs back to their home states, and there are a lot more questions than there are answers about what would happen after that."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gideonse, who also has campaigned for legalizing psilocybin to treat depression, has connections with the Compassion &amp; Choices group which "grew out of the 1980s right-to-die movement of the Hemlock Society and Jack Kevorkian &mdash; the pathologist and notorious 'Dr Death' who assisted scores of suicides and was ultimately convicted of murder," reports the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tucker Carlson &amp; Charles Camosy spoke on this very subject.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Study Could Be 'Scientific Nail in the Coffin' for Masks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the largest and most comprehensive studies on the effectiveness of masks found they do almost nothing to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study reviewed 78 randomized control trials&mdash;experiments that have long been considered "the gold standard" for medicine&mdash;which assessed the effectiveness of face masks against flu, COVID-19, and similar illnesses. It found that wearing masks "probably makes little or no difference" for the general public, no matter what kind of mask is used. Even N95 masks, considered the most effective at filtering airborne particles, showed no clear benefit for health care workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study was published on January 30 by the Cochrane Library, a world-renowned medical database that is famous for its high-quality evidence reviews. It comes as a battering ram to the recommendations of the U.S. public health establishment, which urged children as young as two to wear masks throughout the pandemic.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 2,300 dead after devastating earthquake, aftershocks in Turkey and Syria</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll has surpassed 2,300 after a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Turkey and Syria around 4:17 am on Monday. Both countries have declared a state of emergency as rescue efforts move to find survivors trapped under rubble, reports the Times of Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck a few minutes later at 4:24 am approximately 60 miles north of the first quake's epicenter, which was centered in the southeastern province of Gaziantep, Turkey, according to the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quake's depth was up to 10 miles according to the US Geological Survey and had aftershocks reaching 6.7 on the Richter Scale. Tremors reverberated as far away as Israel and Cairo in Egypt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS reports that UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said "We stand ready to provide further support as needed." A total of 76 search and rescue specialists have been dispatched from the UK to help with the efforts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost immediately after the quake hit, Turkey asked the European Civil Project and Humanitarian Aid Operations for assistance and aid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Turkish Interior Minister said, "The main impact of the earthquake fell on Kahramanmaras. After that, there were at least 22 aftershocks, 6 of magnitude over 6. The earthquake was felt in 10 provinces</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Two hours after the earthquake, several dozen dead are known. In many cities, multi-storey buildings have been destroyed; it is not yet possible to start clearing the rubble."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/prostitutes-sex-workers-catholic-school-oakland"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/prostitutes-sex-workers-catholic-school-oakland</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prostitutes solicit sex right outside Catholic elementary school, police handcuffed after California Democrats passed law to protect transgender sex workers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents of children are up in arms that prostitutes are soliciting sex work right outside a California elementary school. Some are saying that a law passed by California Democrats has handcuffed law enforcement in cracking down on sex workers selling their bodies in broad daylight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGO-TV conducted an investigation about prostitutes working outside St. Anthony's elementary school in East Oakland. The San Francisco-based news station captured video of sex workers dressed in minimal clothes and stiletto heels walking the streets near the Catholic school to sell their bodies in the middle of the day with students nearby.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGO-TV reported, "The I-Team captured videos along E. 15th Street outside the school gate on four different dates over the past couple weeks showing young women wearing barely any clothing walking along the school sidewalk, the street corners, or directly across from the school. All of the videos were captured as children were being dropped off or walked into school."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerned parent Rosa Vargas told KGO-TV said she sees prostitutes near the Catholic school "every day, during all periods of the day."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vargas said the sex workers solicit sex so close to the elementary school that they recently "were blocking the entrance of the parking structure" of the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo noted that he is receiving complaints about prostitutes every week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallo stated, "I get the call saying, 'Mr. Gallo I can't get into my home because the pimp is blocking my driveway.' It's constant."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallo said he has seen up to 20 scantily-clad women walking up and down the street, appearing to engage in prostitution. He revealed that some of the girls are as young as 15 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials believe some of the women are victims of human trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some believe that recent construction along a busy highway caused the sex workers to migrate to residential neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodney Pierre-Antoine &ndash; who oversees seven Catholic elementary schools, including St. Anthony's &ndash; said the hands of the police "are somewhat handcuffed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierre-Antoine is referencing Senate Bill 357, known as the Safer Streets for All Act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 357 states:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing law prohibits soliciting or engaging in an act of prostitution, as specified. Existing law also prohibits loitering in a public place with the intent to commit prostitution, as defined, or directing, supervising, recruiting, or aiding a person who is loitering with the intent to commit prostitution, or collecting or receiving all or part of the proceeds of an act of prostitution. Under existing law, a violation of any of these provisions is a misdemeanor. This bill would repeal those provisions related to loitering with the intent to commit prostitution and would make other conforming changes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed SB 357 into law in July, and it went into effect on Jan. 1.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers told KGO-TV that the new law is prohibiting them from rescuing women who they believe are victims of human trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/democrat-led-state-killing-businesses-shrink-secede-several-counties"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/democrat-led-state-killing-businesses-shrink-secede-several-counties</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat-led state that&rsquo;s &lsquo;killing businesses&rsquo; could shrink amid push to secede in several counties</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 11 Oregon counties approved a preliminary vote to secede from the Democrat-led state, local leaders around the movement are explaining how the urban-rural divide has left them with no other choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People in eastern Oregon have felt like their state-level governance has not heard them, has not paid attention to our concerns, and has not been working for eastern Oregon," Greater Idaho Movement spokesperson Matt McCaw said on "Fox &amp; Friends First" Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCaw, along with Oregon business owner Sandie Gilson, supports the idea of having select counties elect to move their state borderlines so state-level governance would come from Idaho.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last two years, the Greater Idaho Movement has worked to gather constituent sentiment around the proposal. Business owners like Gilson sounded off on Oregon&rsquo;s tax policy, detailing the burden taken on by a corporate activity tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to secede from the state, McCaw argued, would be a "win-win" for all involved parties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formal state bill, called the Greater Idaho Bill, was introduced to the Oregon legislature on Jan. 10.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho state leaders reportedly motioned for formal discussions about the proposal last week, noting the purpose is to "begin official discussions on whether it is feasible to move the Idaho border into eastern Oregon."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if Idaho and Oregon were to negotiate a border adjustment, U.S. Congress would have to sign off on it, in addition to both Oregon and Idaho legislatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan would create what would become the nation&rsquo;s third-largest state geographically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2023/02/06/study-five-months-late-night-93-liberal-guests-1-conservative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2023/02/06/study-five-months-late-night-93-liberal-guests-1-conservative</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Months Of Late Night: 93 Liberal Guests, 1 Conservative</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The late-night comedy shows ended 2022 with a unanimously liberal guest count and that trend continued until the very last day of January, a NewsBusters study has revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRC analysts found that from Labor Day through January 31, liberal guests outnumbered conservative guests 93 to 1. It was 99 percent liberal and/or Democrat. The one exception was My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell who Jimmy Kimmel put on to mock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is follow up to MRC&rsquo;s late night guest election campaign study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study looked at the daily six late night comedy shows: ABC&rsquo;s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, NBC&rsquo;s Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, CBS&rsquo;s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden, and Comedy Central&rsquo;s The Daily Show with Trevor Noah and 2023 temp hosts. Fox's Gutfeld! was not included.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRC analysts divided guests into two categories: partisan officials and then journalists and celebrities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to the count of politicians, the count was 27 Democrats to 0 Republicans. Stephen Colbert led with ten, Noah was second with seven, Meyers was third at four, Fallon came in fourth with three, Kimmel placed fifth at two, and Corden was sixth and last with one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, and former First Lady Michelle Obama were the guests who appeared multiple times during the length of the study. Obama's appearance on Colbert was split into multiple episodes and is counted as multiple appearances and was the only guest to appear three times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese spy balloon carried explosives to self-detonate</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon over the weekend, Pentagon officials have revealed that the balloon potentially was carrying explosives to destroy itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, Air Force Gen. Glen D. VanHerck, commander of US Northern Command, revealed in a Monday call with reporters that the Balloon, in addition to potentially carrying explosives, was 200 feet tall, weighed thousands of pounds, and its payload was the size of a jetliner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v28clmv-the-chinese-spy-balloon-has-finally-been-shot-down..html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v28clmv-the-chinese-spy-balloon-has-finally-been-shot-down..html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanHerck&rsquo;s comments came following a briefing by National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, who defended Biden&rsquo;s decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until the weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the coast of South Carolina on Saturday afternoon, the US military, using an F-22 fighter jet, shot down the balloon with a missile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly before the balloon was shot down, Federal Aviation Administration had issued a ground stop for three airports in the Carolinas located in Wilmington, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balloon had entered US airspace on January 28 and was known to the Biden administration for nearly a week before its report in the news on Thursday, February 2. The White House reportedly tried to keep its presence secret to not disrupt Secretary of State Antony Blinken scheduled trip to China, which was postponed after the public's discovery of the balloon.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antifa claims responsibility for attack on far-left Portland bar in retaliation for them 'spreading Covid' by staying open</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Rose City Antifa have taken credit for vandalism that occurred at a worker-owned Portland Bar in the early hours of January 29.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a "communique" posted to Rose City Counter-Info on January 31, the group stated that the vandalism, carried out by "disabled anarchists," targeted the Worker&rsquo;s Tap because of "how this bar inherently operates with unmitigated COVID spread."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In the early hours of January 29th, some disabled anarchist attacked Worker&rsquo;s Tap by tagging it and damaging a window. Due to the bullet-proof glass, the window&rsquo;s damage would only consist of small dents," the statement read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group said that phrases and symbols like the anarchist "A," and "161" which calls out "that it was fascists forces whom originally paved the path of COVID as a genocide since April 2020 through the blood of primarily Black and Indigenous disabled people, a road of bones which now many liberals and ableist anarchists goose-stomp on in collaboration with the fascists to maintain a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for keeping bars and other viral-friendly entertainment operating at the expense of disabled lives."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the bar was tagged with "Covid Kills!" twice "to address how this bar inherently operates with unmitigated COVID spread, murdering disabled people in the process."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement continued on to say that the act was carried out in "retaliation" to the "event organizers in the anarchist scene who contribute to the COVID pandemic by organizing super-spreader gatherings that, in the end, lead to more disabled people dying."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Multnomah County, where Portland is located, the number of new Covid-19 cases has remained under 1,000 since July. The most recent data shows that in the last full week of January, there were just 275 cases. 31 of those cases required hospitalization. This is down from a spike seen over the summer, with 3,180 cases recorded, and dramatically lower than the omicron spike seen last winter, with 11,373 cases being recorded at its peak, according to county data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Worker&rsquo;s Tap, the bar targeted by the vandalism, is a worker-owned and operated beer bar in Portland, Oregon. The bar required proof of vaccination to enter the establishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to its website, "Our business is run democratically and profits are split amongst our members."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilhan Omar REMOVED from Foreign Affairs Committee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, who has a long history of anti-Semitic remarks, was removed from her position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a 218 to 2011 party-line vote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Correspondent Chad Pergram tweeted, "The House has voted to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) from the Foreign Affairs Committee. The vote was 218 to 211 with one member voting 'present.'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he intended to remove Omar due to her history of antisemitic comments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries acknowledged this history on Thursday and said, "Rep. Omar certainly has made mistakes. She has used antisemitic tropes."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omer was elected to Congress in 2018, and in her long history of using antisemitic tropes has compared the boycotting of the Jewish state of Israel to the boycotting of Nazis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A move to remove Omar began in 2021 after the Democrat-led Congress removed GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a press conference that the removal was a "political stunt" and a "disservice to the American people."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on the House floor "this is about targeting women of color" and slammed her notepad on the lecturn.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Omar out, but Biden's Top Economic Advisor Is Out</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden announced Thursday morning his top economic advisor, Brian Deese, is leaving his position at the White House. Deese served as Biden's National Economic Council Director since taking office in January 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deese's departure comes as economists warn the U.S. is headed into a recession this year. As the head of the NEC, Deese repeatedly claimed Biden's inflation crisis was transitory and advocated for massive federal government spending by Democrats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS' Margaret Brennan pressed Deese over Biden's lie that inflation was "transitory" and solely due to Putin's war:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain officially left his position on Wednesday.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender Inmate Who Committed Kidnapping, Murder Transferred to Women&rsquo;s Prison</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A biological male prisoner who began identifying as a transgender woman and has a history of violence against women was reportedly transferred from a men&rsquo;s prison in Kansas to a women&rsquo;s prison this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inmate, who was known as Thomas Lamb, was convicted of kidnapping and killing a young woman in 1969 and kidnapping a second woman in 1970, according to News13. In 2007, Thomas Lamb changed his name to &ldquo;Michelle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years that followed, Lamb reportedly requested to be moved to a women&rsquo;s facility. This request, however, was denied. But, records obtained by News13 show that Lamb was moved to a women&rsquo;s prison this month (via News 13):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, a U.S. District Court ruled against Lamb in a lawsuit asking the state to transfer HIM to an all-female facility, and allow him to pursue gender re-assignment surgery. An Appeals Court upheld the ruling in 2018, stating that, although it was not the treatment Lamb might want, evidence showed he was being provided treatment for gender dysphoria, and the state was not showing &ldquo;deliberate indifference&rdquo; to his situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Kansas Dept. of Corrections records show he was transferred Jan. 27 to Topeka Correctional Facility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is not known if Lamb will now be allowed to go forward with the gender reassignment surgery, 13 NEWS asked KDOC public affairs director Randall Bowman whether the state would pay for the procedure if he did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowman would not comment on Lamb&rsquo;s case specifically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Healthcare decisions are not made by KDOC officials,&rdquo; Bowman said. &ldquo;Due to patient privacy concerns, KDOC and the Governor&rsquo;s Office cannot comment on the specifics of medical care for any one individual.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/02/tom-brady-announces-his-retirement-for-good-from-the-nfl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/02/tom-brady-announces-his-retirement-for-good-from-the-nfl/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Brady Announces His Retirement &lsquo;For Good&rsquo; From The NFL</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brady, 45, is widely considered the best to ever play his position and potentially the greatest NFL star of all time, following a 23-year career that saw him go to 15 Pro Bowls and win five league MVP awards. His accolades are so far-reaching that his name fills the record books. He leaves the game as its all-time leader in completions (7,753), yards (89, 214), and touchdowns (649).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning six titles playing for Coach Bill Belichick in New England, Brady mulled retirement before signing with Tampa Bay in 2020. He would go on to win his seventh Super Bowl in his first year for the Buccaneers. There, he would be reunited with his old Patriot partner in crime, Rob Gronkowski.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately for Brady and the Bucs, the last two seasons have been a bit of a downward spiral. They captured the woeful NFC South. But at 8-9, they didn&rsquo;t look like they had a prayer of advancing in the postseason. They were bounced by the Dallas Cowboys in the opening round, 31-14, the team looked old and tired, even their forever-young signal caller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brady certainly was no slouch during the regular season. He still threw for threw for 4694&nbsp; yards and 25 touchdowns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he already (half-heartedly) put off retirement last year to return for one more round. He famously announced he was quitting, had a flirtation with joining the Miami Dolphins organization, and then finally acquiesced to returning to Tampa for 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the fatigue and frustration were already there. And the whispers grew into full-fledged gossip as the season progressed: This looked more and more like it was Tom Brady&rsquo;s final season. At least in Tampa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he&rsquo;s confirmed that he won&rsquo;t be playing for anyone in 2023. Brady is, as he puts it into his own words, retiring &ldquo;for good&rdquo; this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his farewell video, the future NFL Hall of Famer was (as usual) reserved and reminiscent. Like so many of his famous fourth-quarter comebacks, he tried to stay calm and cool in the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Tom Brady couldn&rsquo;t hide a hint of emotion as he bid farewell to those who helped him on his epic journey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When his story is eventually written, Brady&rsquo;s will be about an unlikely hero who rose to the level of royalty. He ascended to heights never before reached, all while coming from nearly the bottom of the heap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was famously picked 199th overall in the 2000 draft by the Patriots, behind six other quarterbacks. During his rookie campaign, he played in only one game and didn&rsquo;t exactly look like a future great: The University of Michigan product finished the season having only gone one-for-three for six yards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2001, a serious injury to franchise quarterback Drew Bledsoe would necessitate the start of the Brady Era in New England.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What followed was the greatest run that any quarterback, head coach, or franchise would ever embark on in NFL history. After upsetting the dominant St. Louis Rams and &lsquo;The Greatest Show on Turf&rsquo; in Super Bowl XXXVI the next 17 years were like a whirlwind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What New England was able to accomplish in the 2000s and 2010s not only superseded anything ever seen in the NFL, it rivaled storied franchises from any sport and any era. The Murderers&rsquo; Row Yankees of 1920s Major League Baseball or the NHL&rsquo;s Montreal Canadiens from the 1950s-70s come to mind&hellip; but that&rsquo;s about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers alone put up by Brady and his teams over the years is astronomical. When Joe Montana retired as the gold standard of Super Bowl QBs, he had four rings. TB12 has almost twice that many. And he&rsquo;s played in a whopping TEN title games. The ability to stay healthy and play that well for so many years will likely never be seen by sports fans&rsquo; eyes again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say that Brady&rsquo;s departure from a league where he will always be a figurehead is hard to overstate. His mark on the NFL and the game of football is unparalleled. And his track record of winning is nearly unfathomable. His road to Canton is literally paved in gold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of his successors in signal calling, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said about the G.O.A.T., &ldquo;It&rsquo;s special to see the things he has done in this league. The way he was able to change the position &mdash; the longevity of great success. That&rsquo;s the crazy part: looking at his career, he has never really had a down year.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, it&rsquo;s Friday&hellip; How about a quick feel-good story heading into your weekend?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon driver risks his own safety to rescue dog from burning car</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Amazon driver with a history of helping others while on his route came to the rescue once again when he recently helped spring a dog that had become trapped inside a burning vehicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the evening of January 23, Ervin Ruhe, a 49-year-old Amazon driver, was heading home after a long day at work. He had just assisted a colleague finish his deliveries when he spotted a car on fire on the side of the road in Merced, about 40 minutes outside his hometown of Modesto, California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruhe spotted a man guiding his wife away from the burning vehicle and stopped to see whether he could help. Ruhe described the man &mdash; who, by that time, had returned to the vehicle and had begun attempting to open one of the car doors &mdash; as "distressed," so Ruhe pulled over and quickly grabbed the emergency fire extinguisher located in the back of his delivery van.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It didn&rsquo;t look like it was too bad yet, but I was just hoping nobody was inside," Ruhe later recalled. "I just wanted to try and help out if I was able to."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruhe began immediately dousing the flames with the fire extinguisher when the couple apprised him of their main concern. "Our dog&rsquo;s inside," one of them shouted, "our dog&rsquo;s inside!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, a small chihuahua was trapped in the back seat of the vehicle. Ruhe managed to contain the fire enough to unlock the back door so that the man could open it and bring the little pooch to safety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all creatures, great and small, were out of danger, Ruhe called 911 and took a quick video of the burning car.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/bipartisan-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-ban-china-from-buying-us-farmland_5024703.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/bipartisan-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-ban-china-from-buying-us-farmland_5024703.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Ban China from Buying US Farmland</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and John Tester (D-Mont.) on Feb. 1 introduced a bill to ban China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea from buying or leasing U.S. farmland and agricultural businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed legislation, named the PASS (Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security) Act of 2023, would require the president to report to Congress on any waiver granted to the prohibited countries. It would also make the secretary of agriculture a standing member of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a federal panel that reviews foreign acquisitions for national security risks, and specify agricultural investments as falling under CFIUS&rsquo; jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the legislation is the same as a version introduced last year, Rounds said that this year&rsquo;s bill has more bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress and support from stakeholders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The intent behind this particular legislation was to prohibit China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from establishing locations in the United States where they could monitor activity, specifically potential military activity,&rdquo; said Rounds in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rounds highlighted the value of farming and seed technology developed in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;China has an interest in taking some of our advancements and using them in their country without acknowledging the patents that may accompany that material, which is made easier if they have a base of operation in the United States in which to obtain the material in the first place,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third-generation Montana farmer, Tester said in a statement that he was proud to sponsor the bill to &ldquo;ensure our farmers have a seat at the table when the government makes decisions impacting our national security.&rdquo; Tester added that he was not going to &ldquo;sit back&rdquo; and &ldquo;let our foreign adversaries weaken our national security by buying up American farmland.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture is the lifeblood of South Dakota&rsquo;s economy, worth nearly $12 billion in 2021, according to the South Dakota Department of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources (pdf). As the state&rsquo;s largest industry, agriculture leads tourism&mdash;the second-largest industry, estimated at over $4 billion in 2021&mdash;by three times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South Dakota Farmers Union (SDFU) and South Dakota Sheep Growers Association (SDSGA) have endorsed the bill. Doug Sombke, president of SDFU, in a statement also encouraged other state farmers&rsquo; unions to support the bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is cosponsored by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.). The House version, also introduced on Wednesday, is sponsored by Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Jim Costa (D-Calif.), and Rick Crawford (R-Ark.).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, CFIUS decided that it didn&rsquo;t have jurisdiction to review a land purchase related to a controversial Chinese corn mill project in Grand Forks, North Dakota. That project is located within 15 miles of the Grand Forks Air Force base, which houses sensitive drone, satellite, and surveillance technology, and has prompted significant pushback from Republican lawmakers and locals who say it threatens both national and economic security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Dec. 31, 2020, China owned 325,686 acres of U.S. agricultural land, according to the Department of Agriculture. While the acreage under Chinese ownership is slightly less than 1 percent of all foreign-held agricultural land, it represents a 20-fold leap from 13,720 acres in 2010.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the relatively low percentage of Chinese ownership does not diminish the severity of the threat, according to Rounds, who said that thwarting the trend is important.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lifenews.com/2023/02/01/satanic-temple-opens-new-abortion-clinic-to-kill-babies-in-ritualistic-abortions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.lifenews.com/2023/02/01/satanic-temple-opens-new-abortion-clinic-to-kill-babies-in-ritualistic-abortions/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satanic Temple Opens New Abortion Clinic to Kill Babies in Ritualistic Abortions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple isn&rsquo;t just promoting the killing of unborn babies in abortions anymore. It&rsquo;s actually killing them through a new &ldquo;religious&rdquo; abortion practice in New Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the satanic group launched a new &ldquo;religious medical services arm,&rdquo; TST Health, to begin doing abortions. The Satanic Temple believes aborting unborn babies is a religious &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; and compares it to communion or baptism for Christians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of its first &ldquo;telehealth&rdquo; abortion practice doubles as a covert death wish to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Samuel Alito&rsquo;s Mom&rsquo;s Satanic Abortion Clinic in New Mexico will offer abortion drugs to women ages 17 and up who are up to 11 weeks of pregnancy, according to Fox News. The FDA does not recommend abortion drugs after 10 weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In 1950, Samuel Alito&rsquo;s mother did not have options, and look what happened,&rdquo; said Malcolm Jarry, co-founder of The Satanic Temple, in a statement. &ldquo;Prior to 1973, doctors who performed abortions could lose their licenses and go to jail. The clinic&rsquo;s name serves to remind people just how important it is to have the right to control one&rsquo;s body and the potential ramifications of losing that right.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a press release from the group, &ldquo;anyone in New Mexico seeking to perform The Satanic Temple&rsquo;s abortion ritual will be able to receive free online medical services.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Licensed medical workers will screen patients during a virtual appointment, and then prescribe abortion drugs through pharmacies that will mail them in &ldquo;a discreet package,&rdquo; the group said. Women will be charged a pharmacy fee of about $90, it continued. The satanic group also set up a 24-hour abortion hotline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, The Satanic Temple leaders said they want to expand their new abortion practice to states that ban abortions. Their group has filed lawsuits in several states challenging their legal protections for unborn babies on religious grounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The satanic group claims killing unborn babies in abortions is a religious ritual, and restricting it violates its &ldquo;fundamental tenets,&rdquo; according to an article on Glenn Beck&rsquo;s website. Its leaders also claim pro-life laws are rooted in &ldquo;Christian nationalism&rdquo; &ndash; even though people of all faiths and no faith believe basic human rights should apply to all human beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supposed religion claims to have &ldquo;seven fundamental tenets,&rdquo; including one that teaches, &ldquo;One&rsquo;s body is inviolable, subject to one&rsquo;s own will alone.&rdquo; In its lawsuits, the group claims abortion restrictions and bans violate this teaching as well as an &ldquo;abortion ritual&rdquo; that its members perform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It likens the &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; slaughter of unborn babies to communion or baptism for Christians. In 2020, it even raffled off an abortion to raise money for its lawsuits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple claims to have 700,000 members internationally, and it is a recognized religion by the IRS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group is deeply involved in abortion advocacy. Breitbart once described its work as a &ldquo;pro-abortion crusade to come to the aid of America&rsquo;s largest abortion provider,&rdquo; Planned Parenthood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the past decade, it has filed numerous lawsuits in different states to overturn pro-life laws, though its attempts thus far have failed. Other recent lawsuits include a challenge to the Texas heartbeat law, which pro-life advocates say has saved tens of thousands of unborn babies&rsquo; lives thus far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple also is pushing its beliefs on young children. Recently, the group began opening clubs in elementary schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, these satanic influences can be seen at pro-abortion rallies where abortion activists chant &ldquo;Hail, Satan!&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;fight like hell&rdquo; has become common among prominent pro-abortion politicians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, earlier this month, New York City leaders erected a golden statue to abortion on top of a city courthouse. Many described the statue, a naked woman with horns, as demonic or satanic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/suspects-in-assassination-of-haitian-president-taken-into-us-custody?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/suspects-in-assassination-of-haitian-president-taken-into-us-custody?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspects in assassination of Haitian president taken into US custody</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, US officials announced that four suspects in custody for the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Mo&iuml;se on July 7, 2021 were transferred to the United States for their prosecution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CBS News, "The defendants, James Solages, 37, Joseph Vincent, 57, Alejandro Riveria Garcia, 44, and Christian Sanon, 54, are currently being held in US custody. Solages and Vincent, both US citizens from Florida, were arrested in Haiti shortly after the assassination."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 53-year-old Haitian president was shot 12 times and his wife wounded when his assassins entered his home located near Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspects James Solage and Joseph Vincent, the two US citizens, were arrested first after Mo&iuml;se's killing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Post, Christian Sanon, was " an elderly pastor, doctor, and failed businessman that authorities have identified as a key player. His associates have suggested he was duped by the real &mdash; and still unidentified &mdash; masterminds behind the assassination."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandro Garc&iacute;a, the fourth suspect being moved to the US and a Colombian citizen, was a member of the Colombian, as "nearly two dozen former Colombian soldiers charged in the case."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Mo&iuml;se's death, Haiti's gang activity and related violence increased to historic levels. Judges and local officials grew fearful as they received death threats concerning the assassination trial which contributed to the case being stalled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Justice said, Rivera, Solanges, and Vincent were charged with "conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping outside the US and providing material support and resources resulting in death."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanon was charged with "conspiring to smuggle goods from the US and providing unlawful export information," and allegedly moved 20 ballistic protective vests into Haiti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven suspects in total are now in US federal custody awaiting trial for their part in the assassination. The four men recently moved to the US are set to appear in court in Miami on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Post Millennial reported, Solanges, unidentified at the time, said that the assassination attempt was a DEA operation in an effort to solicit compliance from Haitian security guarding the president.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/30/stephen-and-ayesha-curry-object-to-new-housing-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/01/30/stephen-and-ayesha-curry-object-to-new-housing-development/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen and Ayesha Curry oppose multi-family development near their $30M home</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Famed NBA marksman Stephen Curry appears more comfortable with 3-point daggers than 3-story developments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with his influencer wife Ayesha, Curry has objected to the establishment of multi-family housing on a property next to his sprawling California mansion, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, the couple told officials in Atherton &mdash; one of the nation&rsquo;s most exclusive enclaves &mdash; that the three-story town houses would encroach on their privacy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routinely vocal on matters of social justice, the Bay Area power couple indicated that joining the well-heeled chorus of objection made them uneasy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We hesitate to add to the &lsquo;not in our backyard&rsquo; (literally) rhetoric, but we wanted to send a note before today&rsquo;s meeting,&rdquo; they wrote on Jan. 18. &ldquo;Safety and privacy for us and our kids continues to be our top priority and one of the biggest reasons we chose to live in Atherton.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home to tech moguls, athletes and international business titans, Atherton officials will reluctantly submit a plan to the state this week outlining their efforts to increase housing density.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parcel in question &mdash; which is nea the Curry residence &mdash; is set to be rezoned in order to accommodate several multi-family units sought by the owner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;With the density being proposed for 23 Oakwood, there are major concerns in terms of both privacy and safety with three-story townhomes looming directly behind us,&rdquo; their email read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple noted that the development would not add to low-income housing to the area, only increase density.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If their municipal buzzer beater falls short, the Currys asked the town to erect &ldquo;considerably taller fencing and landscaping to block sight lines onto our family&rsquo;s property.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple recently sold their prior Atherton home for $31 million and bought their current 17,000 square foot spread for $30 million, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other local heavyweights &mdash; including billionaire investor Marc Andriessen &mdash; have previously lobbied against the introduction of more affordable housing into the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a median home price of more than $7 million, Atherton ranked first on Forbes&rsquo; priciest zip code list last year.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/u-s-surgeon-general-warns-13-years-old-is-too-young-to-join-social-media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/u-s-surgeon-general-warns-13-years-old-is-too-young-to-join-social-media</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Surgeon General Warns 13-Years-Old Is Too Young To Join Social Media</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy believes children 13 years old are too young to join social media platforms, citing kids are still &ldquo;developing their identity,&rdquo; and such engagement can create a distorted sense of themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murthy, who has served as surgeon general under the Obama and the Biden administrations, signaled the warning in an interview with CNN, noting adolescents should only be allowed to access the platforms until they were 16 years old at the earliest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time, you know, early adolescence, where kids are developing their identity, their sense of self,&rdquo; Murthy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time where it&rsquo;s really important for us to be thoughtful about what&rsquo;s going into how they think about their own self-worth and their relationships, and the skewed and often distorted environment of social media often does a disservice to many of those children.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media giant platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter require a minimum age of 13 to join.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murthy further noted the issue with addictive algorithms, which pits youth against Big Tech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You have some of the best designers and product developers in the world who have designed these products to make sure people are maximizing the amount of time they spend on these platforms,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if we tell a child, use the force of your willpower to control how much time you&rsquo;re spending, you&rsquo;re pitting a child against the world&rsquo;s greatest product designers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just not a fair fight,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And so that&rsquo;s why I think our kids need help.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journal of the American Medical Association published a study earlier this month which sampled 178 12-year-olds from three public middle schools in North Carolina and reviewed how often the minors check social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found individuals with habitual checking behaviors showed initial hypoactivation but increasing sensitivity to potential social cues over time. Nonhabitual individuals, however, showed initial hyperactivation and decreasing sensitivity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Adriana Stacey told CNN using social media releases a &ldquo;dopamine dump&rdquo; and compared the addictiveness of smartphones to cocaine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surgeon General Murthy called on parents to band together to prevent their children from logging on to social media platforms until they&rsquo;re at least 16 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Public School District officials filed a lawsuit earlier this month against several social media platform owners, including Facebook and TikTok, for allegedly intentionally cultivating and creating a mental health crisis among the youth and have caused a public nuisance affecting Seattle Public Schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden drew attention to social media platforms in his 2022 State of the Union Address, alleging the harm social media has wrought on American youth should implore all to &ldquo;hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they&rsquo;re conducting on our children for profit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration &amp; General Murthy took fire howewver, due to what appears to be inconscistencies in their rules.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told "CNN Newsroom" host Pamela Brown that parents should look to push back the age at which their children begin using social media platforms to make sure kids "don't get exposed to harm early."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last March, Murthy addressed a directive from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, R., effectively cutting gender-affirming care for minors in his state, taking to Twitter to write, "Yesterday afternoon in Austin, I met with transgender youth and their parents to hear how they are coping in light of the state's recent directive equating gender-affirming care to child abuse."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The pain and fear in their voices was heartbreaking. Parents and kids are terrified about being separated. They described repeated attacks on their families at traumatic&hellip; LGBTQ+ youth were already at increased risk of suicide and other mental health struggles. We should be seeking to provide them with support and medical care&hellip;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Forcing parents to choose between following medical advice for their child and risking an investigation from the state is simply not right. The government shouldn't be interfering with decisions between doctors and patients," he continued.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol Agents Told to Not Chase All Vehicles That Flee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas&mdash;Border Patrol agents will soon be limited in chasing vehicles that flee from them, under new rules unveiled in January and set to take effect in May.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents must determine that vehicular pursuits are &ldquo;necessary and objectively reasonable&rdquo; under the rules, and can terminate a pursuit at any time without fear of questioning from superiors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents are being told that they must consider factors such as &ldquo;the seriousness of the reason&rdquo; for a pursuit and weather conditions when deciding whether to chase a fleeing vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint or port of entry&mdash;the official places to enter the United States from Mexico and Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A Vehicular Pursuit is considered Necessary when an Authorized Officer/Agent concludes there is an immediate need to apprehend a subject as part of their enforcement duties based on the totality of the known facts and circumstances,&rdquo; the rules state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pursuit meets the &ldquo;objectively reasonable&rdquo; standard when the government&rsquo;s interest in apprehending the persons or people in the fleeing vehicle &ldquo;clearly outweighs the Foreseeability of Risk to the public, officers/agents, other law enforcement, and vehicle occupants,&rdquo; the rules state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents must evaluate the interest and the potential risk when choosing whether to pursue a fleeing vehicle and continue the evaluation during the chase. They must also alert a supervisor &ldquo;as soon as feasible&rdquo; during a pursuit and immediately terminate the chase if the supervisor does not authorize it to continue, or orders it stopped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a chase is terminated, agents must pull their vehicle over to signal to the public and the fleeing driver that the chase has ended, according to the rules. They must alert superiors. They can then start driving again in the last known direction of the fleeing vehicle to check for &ldquo;crashes, potential flight on foot, to determine if the Subject Vehicle was abandoned, or for any other incident.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules also suggest alternatives to vehicular pursuits, such as tracking with airplanes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troy Miller, who became acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner in late 2022 after the ouster of Chris Magnus, said that vehicular pursuits &ldquo;pose inherent risks&mdash;to members of the public, officers and agents, and vehicle occupants&rdquo; and that the new policy &ldquo;acknowledges these risks and shifts our Agency&rsquo;s overall approach to a risk-based model when it comes to pursuits.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnus stressed that the policy does not bar vehicular pursuits but &ldquo;provides a clear framework&rdquo; for weighing the risks associated with pursuits against the benefits.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida taking the first steps to become 26th constitutional carry state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speaker of the Florida House announced lawmakers had filed the bill this morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida lawmakers&rsquo; promise to introduce legislation allowing permitless concealed carry of firearms, called &ldquo;Constitutional Carry&rdquo; by proponents, has been met. At a Monday morning press briefing, House Speaker Paul Renner (R-Palm Coast) and other gathered lawmakers announced House Bill 543, which would allow weapons and firearms without a license for concealment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed bill was written by Rep. Chuck Brannan (R-Lake City), with state Sen. Jay Collins (R-Tampa) writing the companion legislation for the Florida Senate. Gov. Ron DeSantis said in December that he was committed to the legislation passing and urged state lawmakers to propose it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed bill, Floridians would no longer need to apply for a license for concealed carry. The state of Florida already allows firearm purchases for those 21 and older without need of state application, aside from federal requirements for background checks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the bill pass, the regulation of concealed carry permits, handled by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, would end.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York hotel mobbed by illegal migrants who refuse to leave</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal aliens standing outside of the Watson Hotel in New York's Hell's Kitchen district on Sunday night refused to leave for a new shelter, causing police to mobilize.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 50 migrants were outside of the hotel, along with activists who were handing out food and water.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials said that single men were supposed to be brought to a new shelter at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal that would provide the same services that they were receiving at the hotel. The city bus arrived, but only a small number of migrants hopped on the bus. Most decided to stay outside the hotel on West 57th Street. Activists claimed that migrants were being relocated from the hotel. One activist was quoted telling the New York Post that they were prepared to stay overnight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dozen police were originally stationed at the Watson hotel, with police remaining on-scene until around midnight as migrants were still surrounding the entrance of the hotel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brooklyn Cruise Terminal is a new mega shelter that can house as many as 1,000 single adult men, Mayor Eric Adams said last week.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/suicide-bomber-breaches-high-security-in-pakistan-mosque-kills-59"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/suicide-bomber-breaches-high-security-in-pakistan-mosque-kills-59</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now in world news&hellip; Suicide bomber breaches high security in Pakistan mosque, kills 59</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A suicide bomber blew himself up inside a crowded mosque in a highly fortified security compound in Pakistan on Monday, killing 59 people, the latest attack by resurgent Islamist militants targeting police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attacker appeared to have passed through several barricades manned by security forces to get into the &ldquo;Red Zone&rdquo; compound that houses police and counter-terrorism offices in the volatile northwestern city of Peshawar, police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the 170 wounded people were in critical condition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll rose to 59 after several people succumbed to their wounds, hospital official Mohammad Asim said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bombing happened a day before an International Monetary Fund mission to Islamabad to initiate talks on unlocking funding for the South Asian country&rsquo;s economy, which is enduring a balance of payments crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bomber detonated his load at the moment hundreds of people lined up to say their prayers, officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have found traces of explosives,&rdquo; Khan told reporters, adding that a security lapse had clearly occurred as the bomber had slipped through the most secured area of the compound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An inquiry was under way into how the attacker breached such an elite security cordon and whether there was any inside help.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/politics/us-isis-leader-killed-somalia/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/politics/us-isis-leader-killed-somalia/index.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US military operation kills senior ISIS leader in Somalia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN - A US military operation killed a senior ISIS leader and 10 members of the terror group in northern Somalia on Wednesday, two senior Biden administration officials said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;From a mountainous cave complex in northern Somalia, Bilal al-Sudani is assessed to have supported ISIS&rsquo; expansion and activities across Africa and beyond the continent,&rdquo; the first senior administration official said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed that al-Sudani had been killed in a statement later on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;On January 25, on orders from the President, the U.S. military conducted an assault operation in northern Somalia that resulted in the death of a number of ISIS members, including Bilal-al-Sudani, an ISIS leader in Somalia and a key facilitator for ISIS&rsquo;s global network. Al-Sudani was responsible for fostering the growing presence of ISIS in Africa and for funding the group&rsquo;s operations worldwide, including in Afghanistan,&rdquo; Austin said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No civilians were harmed as a result of this operation. We are grateful to our extraordinary service members as well as our intelligence community and other interagency partners for their support to this successful counterterrorism operation,&rdquo; Austin added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US forces, according to the official, were prepared to capture al-Sudani but the &ldquo;hostile force&rsquo;s response&rdquo; ultimately resulted in his death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No US troops or civilians were killed, although one service member was injured during the operation after being bitten by an American military dog.The second official said that the US notified two counterterrorism partners, including the Somali government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unusual for the US to carry out an operation against ISIS in Somalia, where military operations have typically focused on al-Shabaab fighters, the dominant terror group in Somalia. The strike comes after US forces killed two top ISIS leaders in an airstrike in Syria near the end of last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation represents the continuation of the Biden administration&rsquo;s strategy to counter terrorist threats through &ldquo;over-the-horizon&rdquo; operations like this, a shift in strategy the president made clear following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al-Sudani was sanctioned by the US treasury in 2012 for helping foreign fighters travel to an al-Shabaab training camp and facilitating financing, according to the first official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation, according to the first official, is expected to provide &ldquo;valuable information&rdquo; for the US intelligence community, although they declined to go into specifics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation was announced by US Africa Command (AFRICOM) on Thursday, which said only that the US military &ldquo;conducted a successful counterterrorism operation in Somalia&rdquo; and that &ldquo;no civilians were injured or killed.&rdquo; The second senior administration official said on Thursday that senior members of President Joe Biden&rsquo;s national security team were first briefed on the intelligence that led to this operation a &ldquo;number of months ago.&rdquo; Biden authorized the operation earlier this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first official declined to provide details on the service members who were involved in the operation but emphasized their &ldquo;exceptional preparation&rdquo; for the mission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-official-pushed-ban-gas-stoves-calls-anger-misdirected"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-official-pushed-ban-gas-stoves-calls-anger-misdirected</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden official who pushed to ban gas stoves calls anger over it &lsquo;misdirected&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. pushed back against the firestorm his comments about banning gas stoves created, calling the anger "misdirected."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When you learn upsetting new information about something you&rsquo;ve been around for a long time &mdash; maybe your whole life &mdash; you can never predict people&rsquo;s reactions," he said. "And there is going to be justifiable anger, and sometimes it&rsquo;s misdirected," he told The Washington Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trumka was appointed by President Biden in 2021 and is the son of labor union leader, Richard Trumka, the longtime president of AFL-CIO.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden official admitted to the paper that his work and experience as a father made him "paranoid" about every day hazards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s very easy to see how everyday things can be hazardous," Trumka said to the outlet adding later, "I&rsquo;m much more paranoid than the average person."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Biden official hoped the national debate over gas stoves caused more people to be aware of how their indoor appliances could be causing health risks due to pollution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Post noted that the Consumer Product Safety Commission is in "the very early stages" of determining regulations on new gas stoves, after "years of research" has found they emit nitrogen dioxide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when asked by Fox News Digital, the government agency could not provide any specific studies that backed up these claims to justify a ban on these products.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bans against stoves have started at the local and state level. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed abolishing the sale of gas-powered appliances and banning their installation in new buildings by 2025.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and far-left environmental groups are pushing to regulate several other household appliances, from water heaters to furnaces, to washing machines to microwaves and shower heads in their quest to get Americans away from fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We&rsquo;re actually going to do 100 rules this year alone on appliances," former top White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said during a speech last May. "We are developing partnerships on how we work together for new building standards."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when news broke earlier this month that the Biden administration was considering a ban on gas stoves, it created a backlash from the public, restaurant owners and Republicans who slammed the move as an example of government overreach.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie Hobbs to bus illegal immigrants out of Arizona, won't say where they are going</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is continuing her Republican predecessor Doug Ducey&rsquo;s program to bus illegal migrants out of the state, but in a way that she says will be more "efficient and humane."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs told The Arizona Republic on Tuesday that her administration would focus on ensuring that the program and associated costs were "efficient and humane."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ducey began busing the illegal migrants out of the state in May, and Hobbs has expanded the program to include an option of chartered air travel, according to an updated contract signed on January 14. Over 3,000 people were bused from the Yuma area to Washington DC during Ducey&rsquo;s time in office, costing the state over $7 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Republican lawmakers had earmarked $15 million for the program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, a Yuma official warned that the city is on the brink of collapse due to being overwhelmed by illegal migrants thanks to the Biden administration's failed immigration policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The border has seen a historic crisis under President Joe Biden's presidency. Illegal border crossings in December reached their highest level of the Biden administration, topping 250,000 in the final month of 2022 continuing the pattern of breaking records every month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs told reporters last week regarding the bussing: "We need to look at that practice and make sure it&rsquo;s effective, [that] it&rsquo;s something that supports local communities. If we&rsquo;re spending the money to bus people, why not just get them to their final destination?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs told The Arizona Republic that her actions would be different than the methods of Republican governors Greg Abbott, of Texas, and Ron DeSantis, of Florida, who both have transported migrants to Democratic-run cities to showcase the failure of Biden&rsquo;s border policies. An updated contract removed the requirement that buses with illegal immigrants must be sent to Washington, DC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Washington, DC's Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a public emergency related to the migrants being bussed to the US capital. Democratic New York Mayor Eric Adams declared that there is no more room for illegal immigrants in the city despite its status as a "sanctuary city" for migrants, and called on the federal government to solve the crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs added, "We're interested in focusing on the humanitarian aspects of this and just putting people on a bus as a political stunt and sending them to Martha's Vineyard or wherever they went is not providing any help or any solution to the actual issue."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN&rsquo;s Primetime Viewership Plummets to Just 444,000 as Don Lemon Hits Record Low</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And no, it wasn&rsquo;t a slow new week. Between the classified documents scandal, Ukraine, and the roil over House committee seats, CNN had plenty to report on, or should we say &lsquo;spin.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Fox News raked in an n average of 1.996 million primetime viewers during that week, five times more than CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSNBC faired better than CNN, attracting nearly a million with 943,000 average primetime viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN barely cracked 400,000 with just 417,000 in total day viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News more than tripled that with 1.387 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSNBC did better but still only averaged 629,000 total viewers throughout the day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 25-54 age demographic that sets advertiser rates, Fox News averaged 256,000 demo viewers, MSNBC averaged just 91,000, and CNN did just 93,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News averaged 176,000 demo viewers throughout the day and came in a distant second with 80,000, and MSNBC came in last with 69,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For cable news, which set a baseline for success for 100,000 demo viewers, CNN and MSNBC are failing miserably.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all of cable, Fox News came in second behind ESPN in total primetime viewers, MSNBC third, and CNN eighteenth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newly-installed Chris Licht was supposed to turn CNN back into a network viewers wanted to watch, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, CNN sucks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As previously reported, Lemon was demoted from his primetime show to save CNN&rsquo;s failed morning show. With Lemon on board, New Day became CNN This Morning, and that became a catastrophe that averaged only 331,000 viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that time, Fox News attracted 1.3 million and 180,000 demo viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Lemon sunk to only 65,000 demo viewers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN has been a national joke for quite a while, but now it&rsquo;s official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2023/01/26/biden-makes-first-move-toward-a-radical-national-rent-control-law-n1665210"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2023/01/26/biden-makes-first-move-toward-a-radical-national-rent-control-law-n1665210</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Makes First Move Toward a Radical National Rent Control Law</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to a letter sent earlier this month by congressional radicals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urging the president to take executive action to prevent evictions and lower rent prices,&nbsp; Joe Biden has initiated a series of actions that will eventually lead to a national rent control law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning of the republic, laws governing rent and leases have been local matters. If a landlord is cheating renters, local and state governments have the authority and the tools to punish the landlord. And being much closer to the problems of renters and landlords than anyone in Washington, local and state governments have a much better handle on the local rental housing situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, the federal government doesn&rsquo;t believe that landlords should be compensated for owning rental property. They&rsquo;re &ldquo;gouging&rdquo; renters. This is after more than two years of preventing landlords from evicting renters for non-payment of rent. And in a period of rapidly rising inflation, landlords are being accused of &ldquo;profiteering&rdquo; at the expense of renters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s a ridiculous charge given that 98 percent of all rental property owners, or 80 percent of all rental properties, are owned by small business entrepreneurs who own five units or fewer, according to a study in Business Wire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rules, and any legislation supported by AOC, would destroy the rental housing market and make it much harder to find affordable housing. What small business owner wants to be beholden to Washington for their business? Rental housing will disappear &mdash; perhaps the intended purpose of the new rules.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrative of corporate greed being responsible for rent increases is a far easier sell than small businesses struggling to keep their properties during an inflationary economy that Warren, AOC, and Biden are mostly responsible for.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Thursday, January 26th, 2023, and that was the former Levi&rsquo;s Chief Marketing Officer, Jennifer Sey in our back stage portal.

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/idaho-massacre-suspect-had-job-interview-with-same-police-department-that-aided-in-his-arrest?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/idaho-massacre-suspect-had-job-interview-with-same-police-department-that-aided-in-his-arrest?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho massacre suspect had job interview with same police department that aided in his arrest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Kohbeger, the 28-year-old PhD criminology student suspected of murdering four University of Idaho students in November, reportedly met with the police chief of the same department that helped track him across the country, ultimately leading to his arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The New York Times, the Washington State University student met with Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins on April 12, 2022, according to emails the publication obtained. Hours after the meeting, Kohberger followed up with Jenkins, writing "It was a great pleasure to meet with you today and share my thoughts and excitement regarding the research assistantship for public safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publication reported that the accused killer was looking to land a three-year research assistant position in public safety, which was being offered through WSU's doctorate program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Edition reported that the job description posted by the school stated that "the purpose of these positions is to support each agency through data management and analysis, and to position them for success when they seek external funding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently unknown if Kohberger landed the position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also unclear if this research role is the same position referenced in Kohberger's probable cause affidavit, which claims that he "wrote an essay when he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in the fall of 2022."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the affidavit, Kohberger "had an interest in assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technical data in public safety operations."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brutal stabbing murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, all students at the University of Idaho, led law enforcement on a cross-country chase all the way to Kohberger's hometown in Pennsylvania. According to the Post Millenial, It was the Pullman police department that collaborated with federal law enforcement in tracking the suspect after he left Moscow, Idaho.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hate-crime-hoax-idaho-police-white-power-graffiti-high-school-created-rival-hispanic-gangs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/hate-crime-hoax-idaho-police-white-power-graffiti-high-school-created-rival-hispanic-gangs</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate crime hoax: Idaho police say 'White Power' graffiti on high school created by 'rival' Hispanic gangs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Idaho police department determined that "White Power" graffiti found at a local high school was not an act of hate, but an "act of intimidation" between two "rival Hispanic criminal street gangs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At this time, detectives no longer believe the incident to be motivated by hate but rather an act of intimidation between two rival Hispanic criminal street gangs from Caldwell," the Caldwell Police Department said on Facebook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Detectives are basing this off of evidence, video, and other factors discovered in the course of the investigation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words "White Power" were found spray-painted on the side of Caldwell High School last Thursday, two days after the high school held a "Brown Pride" protest, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Tuesday protest was held in support of a student who was told to remove a hooded sweatshirt reading "Brown Pride" because other people reportedly found it "racist," the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School officials reportedly compared the phrase to a "white pride" shirt, according to the student who was told to remove the shirt, Brenda Hernandez. She ultimately turned the hoodie inside-out so the phrase could not be seen while she was on school property.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell High School principal Anita Wilson said at the time that the school has a strict dress code "compared to other school districts because Caldwell has had a gang problem before, and 'Brown Pride' is associated with gangs."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the graffiti was found Thursday, the police chief denounced what at the time appeared to be an act of hate, saying "we will not tolerate hate in our city and will ensure that whoever is responsible for this will be held accountable for their actions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, police provided an update that the graffiti vandalism is believed to be a "diversion tactic" used by one of the Hispanic gangs in the area to avoid being caught by police, and "was possibly done to exploit the recent protest at Caldwell High School."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police posted screenshots of surveillance footage from the night the school was vandalized, showing individuals wearing black masks and hoodies standing near a wall while holding what appears to be spray paint. Police said they believe two groups of four people, or a total of eight suspects, arrived in two separate cars on Thursday to graffiti the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell Chief of Police Rex Ingram lauded his department for its investigation and vowed to track down those responsible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A police spokesperson further clarified to Fox News Digital Monday that the department believes the vandalism is gang related as it is "consistent with gang activity and we&rsquo;ve identified the tagging as consistent with gangs in the area." The spokesperson added that the department has additional evidence, but is not releasing the details as the investigation is ongoing.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenient Timing: Pelosi Sold $3 Million of Google Stock Weeks Before DOJ Launched Antitrust Probe</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and her multimillionaire husband sold up to $3 million in shares of Google in recent weeks&mdash;just before the Biden Justice Department launched an antitrust probe of the tech giant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pelosi sold 30,000 shares of Google from Dec. 20 to Dec. 28, according to a financial disclosure filing the former House speaker submitted to the House Ethics Committee. The Pelosis made an undisclosed profit from the investments, according to the filing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trade proved timely. On Monday, the Justice Department and attorneys general from eight states&mdash;including California&mdash;sued Google over its monopoly on the digital ad market. The lawsuit could force Google to break up its online ad business, which generated nearly $55 billion in revenue for the company in the most recent quarter. Google's stock has dropped around 6 percent since the Justice Department announced the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trades are the latest in a string of questionable transactions for Paul and Nancy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They saved roughly $600,000 in June by selling shares of microchip maker Nvidia weeks before the U.S. government placed restrictions on the company's business in China and Russia. The Pelosis have seen their fortune grow $140 million since 2008, thanks largely to Paul Pelosi's stock trades, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi's stock market charades have sparked calls for tougher regulations on members of Congress cashing in on their positions of power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) on Tuesday introduced the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act&mdash;the PELOSI Act&mdash;to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/25/us-m1-abrams-biden-tanks-ukraine-russia-war"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/25/us-m1-abrams-biden-tanks-ukraine-russia-war</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US joins Germany in sending tanks to Ukraine as Biden hails &lsquo;united&rsquo; effort</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden has approved sending 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a significant escalation in the US effort to counter Russian aggression as international reluctance to send tanks to the battlefront falls away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reversal of the US&rsquo;s previous position came after Germany confirmed it will make 14 of its Leopard 2A6 tanks available for Ukraine&rsquo;s war effort, and give partner countries its permission to re-export other battle tanks to aid Kyiv.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By agreeing to send the Abrams, the US is able to meet the demand of the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for an American commitment but without having to send the tanks immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden added: &ldquo;We remain united and determined as ever in our conviction and our cause. These tanks are further evidence of our enduring, unflagging commitment to Ukraine and our confidence in the skill of the Ukrainian forces.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&rsquo;s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy applauded Biden for the &ldquo;powerful decision to provide Abrams,&rdquo; declaring on Twitter that &ldquo;the free world is united as never before&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, the president had spoken by phone with president Emmanuel Macron of France, Scholz of Germany, prime minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy and prime minister Rishi Sunak of Britain. Biden said: &ldquo;Germany has really stepped up. The chancellor&rsquo;s been a strong, strong voice for unity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In public statements, Washington and Berlin had denied any connection between their respective decisions on tanks, although media reports said German officials had made clear in private that the Leopards were conditional on the US making a similar commitment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a minority of parents emphasize passing on their faith to children:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Christianity Today: While mental health concerns top the list of worries for parents today, and studies suggest religion is good for mental health, passing on their religious beliefs to their children is not highly prioritized by US adults with children younger than 18, new data from the Pew Research Center show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across racial and ethnic lines, overwhelming majorities of U.S. adults with children younger than 18 believe being a parent is either one of or the most important aspect of who they are as a person. But when it comes to prioritizing the passing on of their faith to their children, white Evangelicals and black Protestants are the only two Christian groups where a majority of parents prioritize this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Parents place less importance on their children growing up to have religious or political beliefs that are similar to their own. About a third (35%) say it is extremely or very important to them that their children share their religious beliefs, and 16% say the same about their children's political beliefs," Pew researchers Rachel Minkin and Juliana Horowitz said in Parenting in America Today released on Tuesday. "Republican and Democratic parents are about equally likely to say it's at least very important to them that their children share their political beliefs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data for Parenting in America Today came from some 3,757 U.S. parents with children younger than 18, which was collected as part of a larger survey conducted from Sept. 20 to Oct. 2, 2022, to better understand how American parents approach parenting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 40% of black parents and 39% of Hispanic parents in the study told researchers that it's extremely or very important to them that their children share their religious beliefs. That share is even lower among white and Asian parents where only 32% say it's important that their children share the same religion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results of a survey of nearly 10,000 young people ages 13-25 about their beliefs, practices, behaviors, relationships and mental health published last October by Springtide Research Institute in The State of Religion &amp; Young People 2022: Mental Health&ndash;What Faith Leaders Need to Know, it was found that during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, 53% of respondents reported that mental health was their biggest challenge. Yet only 34% reported being comfortable talking about their struggle with adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 57% said new spiritual practices helped them endure the pandemic and more than half (51%) said they turned to prayer. Others turned to activities like reading, yoga, the arts or being in nature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that while religion and spirituality "can be strong antidotes to much of what contributes to mental-health struggles among young people" and that "people who are religious are better off mentally and emotionally," only 35% of the respondents said they are connected to a religious community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents connected to a religious community were found to be more likely to say they are "flourishing a lot" in their mental and emotional well-being (29%) than those not connected to a religious community (20%).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents who say they are "very religious" were more likely to report that they are "flourishing a lot" (40%) compared to those who say they are not religious (17%). Respondents who are "not religious" were more than twice as likely to say they are "not flourishing" (44%) than "very religious" respondents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study appeared to confirm decades of previous research pointing to a positive relationship between religion, spirituality and mental health.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">49ers' Brock Purdy receives praise for keeping his faith in the picture ahead of NFC title</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco 49ers rising star Brock Purdy is on the brink of making history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quarterback could become the first rookie to lead his team to a Super Bowl appearance. He&rsquo;s the latest rookie quarterback to guide his team to a conference championship. And while Purdy has won each of the seven games he&rsquo;s started, he&rsquo;s receiving praise for another reason &mdash; putting faith first.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former Iowa State standout has been open about his religion.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho massacre suspect had job interview with same police department that aided in his arrest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Kohbeger, the 28-year-old PhD criminology student suspected of murdering four University of Idaho students in November, reportedly met with the police chief of the same department that helped track him across the country, ultimately leading to his arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The New York Times, the Washington State University student met with Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins on April 12, 2022, according to emails the publication obtained. Hours after the meeting, Kohberger followed up with Jenkins, writing "It was a great pleasure to meet with you today and share my thoughts and excitement regarding the research assistantship for public safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publication reported that the accused killer was looking to land a three-year research assistant position in public safety, which was being offered through WSU's doctorate program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Edition reported that the job description posted by the school stated that "the purpose of these positions is to support each agency through data management and analysis, and to position them for success when they seek external funding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently unknown if Kohberger landed the position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also unclear if this research role is the same position referenced in Kohberger's probable cause affidavit, which claims that he "wrote an essay when he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in the fall of 2022."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the affidavit, Kohberger "had an interest in assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technical data in public safety operations."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brutal stabbing murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, all students at the University of Idaho, led law enforcement on a cross-country chase all the way to Kohberger's hometown in Pennsylvania. According to the Post Millenial, It was the Pullman police department that collaborated with federal law enforcement in tracking the suspect after he left Moscow, Idaho.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate crime hoax: Idaho police say 'White Power' graffiti on high school created by 'rival' Hispanic gangs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Idaho police department determined that "White Power" graffiti found at a local high school was not an act of hate, but an "act of intimidation" between two "rival Hispanic criminal street gangs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At this time, detectives no longer believe the incident to be motivated by hate but rather an act of intimidation between two rival Hispanic criminal street gangs from Caldwell," the Caldwell Police Department said on Facebook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Detectives are basing this off of evidence, video, and other factors discovered in the course of the investigation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words "White Power" were found spray-painted on the side of Caldwell High School last Thursday, two days after the high school held a "Brown Pride" protest, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Tuesday protest was held in support of a student who was told to remove a hooded sweatshirt reading "Brown Pride" because other people reportedly found it "racist," the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School officials reportedly compared the phrase to a "white pride" shirt, according to the student who was told to remove the shirt, Brenda Hernandez. She ultimately turned the hoodie inside-out so the phrase could not be seen while she was on school property.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell High School principal Anita Wilson said at the time that the school has a strict dress code "compared to other school districts because Caldwell has had a gang problem before, and 'Brown Pride' is associated with gangs."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the graffiti was found Thursday, the police chief denounced what at the time appeared to be an act of hate, saying "we will not tolerate hate in our city and will ensure that whoever is responsible for this will be held accountable for their actions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, police provided an update that the graffiti vandalism is believed to be a "diversion tactic" used by one of the Hispanic gangs in the area to avoid being caught by police, and "was possibly done to exploit the recent protest at Caldwell High School."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police posted screenshots of surveillance footage from the night the school was vandalized, showing individuals wearing black masks and hoodies standing near a wall while holding what appears to be spray paint. Police said they believe two groups of four people, or a total of eight suspects, arrived in two separate cars on Thursday to graffiti the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell Chief of Police Rex Ingram lauded his department for its investigation and vowed to track down those responsible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A police spokesperson further clarified to Fox News Digital Monday that the department believes the vandalism is gang related as it is "consistent with gang activity and we&rsquo;ve identified the tagging as consistent with gangs in the area." The spokesperson added that the department has additional evidence, but is not releasing the details as the investigation is ongoing.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenient Timing: Pelosi Sold $3 Million of Google Stock Weeks Before DOJ Launched Antitrust Probe</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and her multimillionaire husband sold up to $3 million in shares of Google in recent weeks&mdash;just before the Biden Justice Department launched an antitrust probe of the tech giant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pelosi sold 30,000 shares of Google from Dec. 20 to Dec. 28, according to a financial disclosure filing the former House speaker submitted to the House Ethics Committee. The Pelosis made an undisclosed profit from the investments, according to the filing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trade proved timely. On Monday, the Justice Department and attorneys general from eight states&mdash;including California&mdash;sued Google over its monopoly on the digital ad market. The lawsuit could force Google to break up its online ad business, which generated nearly $55 billion in revenue for the company in the most recent quarter. Google's stock has dropped around 6 percent since the Justice Department announced the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trades are the latest in a string of questionable transactions for Paul and Nancy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They saved roughly $600,000 in June by selling shares of microchip maker Nvidia weeks before the U.S. government placed restrictions on the company's business in China and Russia. The Pelosis have seen their fortune grow $140 million since 2008, thanks largely to Paul Pelosi's stock trades, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi's stock market charades have sparked calls for tougher regulations on members of Congress cashing in on their positions of power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) on Tuesday introduced the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act&mdash;the PELOSI Act&mdash;to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US joins Germany in sending tanks to Ukraine as Biden hails &lsquo;united&rsquo; effort</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden has approved sending 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a significant escalation in the US effort to counter Russian aggression as international reluctance to send tanks to the battlefront falls away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reversal of the US&rsquo;s previous position came after Germany confirmed it will make 14 of its Leopard 2A6 tanks available for Ukraine&rsquo;s war effort, and give partner countries its permission to re-export other battle tanks to aid Kyiv.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By agreeing to send the Abrams, the US is able to meet the demand of the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for an American commitment but without having to send the tanks immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden added: &ldquo;We remain united and determined as ever in our conviction and our cause. These tanks are further evidence of our enduring, unflagging commitment to Ukraine and our confidence in the skill of the Ukrainian forces.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&rsquo;s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy applauded Biden for the &ldquo;powerful decision to provide Abrams,&rdquo; declaring on Twitter that &ldquo;the free world is united as never before&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, the president had spoken by phone with president Emmanuel Macron of France, Scholz of Germany, prime minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy and prime minister Rishi Sunak of Britain. Biden said: &ldquo;Germany has really stepped up. The chancellor&rsquo;s been a strong, strong voice for unity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In public statements, Washington and Berlin had denied any connection between their respective decisions on tanks, although media reports said German officials had made clear in private that the Leopards were conditional on the US making a similar commitment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a minority of parents emphasize passing on their faith to children:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Christianity Today: While mental health concerns top the list of worries for parents today, and studies suggest religion is good for mental health, passing on their religious beliefs to their children is not highly prioritized by US adults with children younger than 18, new data from the Pew Research Center show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across racial and ethnic lines, overwhelming majorities of U.S. adults with children younger than 18 believe being a parent is either one of or the most important aspect of who they are as a person. But when it comes to prioritizing the passing on of their faith to their children, white Evangelicals and black Protestants are the only two Christian groups where a majority of parents prioritize this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Parents place less importance on their children growing up to have religious or political beliefs that are similar to their own. About a third (35%) say it is extremely or very important to them that their children share their religious beliefs, and 16% say the same about their children's political beliefs," Pew researchers Rachel Minkin and Juliana Horowitz said in Parenting in America Today released on Tuesday. "Republican and Democratic parents are about equally likely to say it's at least very important to them that their children share their political beliefs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data for Parenting in America Today came from some 3,757 U.S. parents with children younger than 18, which was collected as part of a larger survey conducted from Sept. 20 to Oct. 2, 2022, to better understand how American parents approach parenting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 40% of black parents and 39% of Hispanic parents in the study told researchers that it's extremely or very important to them that their children share their religious beliefs. That share is even lower among white and Asian parents where only 32% say it's important that their children share the same religion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rev. Franklin Graham, CEO of Samaritan's Purse and of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, was the latest to congratulate Purdy after his win over the Dallas Cowboys and noted his openness about his belief in God and Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They&rsquo;re now just one game away from the Super Bowl! In addition to being a super talented football player, I love the fact that Brock Purdy is so open about his faith in Jesus Christ," Graham wrote Monday in a Facebook post, adding that he was rooting for the 49ers to win the Super Bowl.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the days leading up to the game against the Cowboys, Purdy explained to reporters how he was just trying to stay in the moment amid all the attention swirling around him and his team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdy also opened up to Sports Spectrum in 2021 about his faith. He said that while at Iowa State, he asked God to forgive him for putting the sport he loved ahead of his relationship with God.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Policies to Burden American Businesses With Higher Taxes This Year</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses in the United States are set to face a bigger federal tax burden in 2023 due to Democrat policies and the phasing out of Republican tax overhauls, combined with an expected raise in corporate minimum tax for billion-dollar companies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included several changes due to which businesses will face higher taxes. In addition, some of the temporary provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted under the Trump administration are set to get phased out in 2023. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the total effect of these two developments would result in additional tax increases of $115 billion for businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new corporate minimum tax charges a 15 percent levy on American businesses that make more than $1 billion in book income in a year for three consecutive years. As a result, the average effective tax rate on corporate income is expected to rise from 18.7 percent to 19.3 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 200 of America&rsquo;s biggest companies with more than $1 billion in profits are likely to be affected by the corporate minimum tax. They usually pay less than the 21 percent tax typically charged on firms. In addition, the minimum tax rule will also apply to foreign firms that generate over $100 billion in book income in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that meet the conditions under this new tax policy must calculate their taxes in two ways: under the 15 percent corporate minimum tax rule and the 21 percent income tax rule. They must then pay the higher tax. Businesses operating in sectors like mining and real estate are expected to be the hardest hit by this change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock buyback tax levies a 1 percent charge on publicly traded firms when they repurchase stocks. Some experts estimate that this tax will end up forcing businesses to maintain more cash on their company books when the money could have gone for investment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategists at UBS calculate the two taxes will be a drag on company earnings this year, estimating a 1.5 percent decrease per share in firms listed on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Hawley to Propose Legislation Banning TikTok Nationwide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said on Tuesday he will introduce legislation to ban TikTok nationwide, charging that it violates the privacy of Americans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley for years has moved to rein in TikTok.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sens. Hawley and Rick Scott (R-F) proposed legislation in March 2020 that would ban TikTok from all federal government devices, citing cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Chinese government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress passed Hawley&rsquo;s bill to ban TikTok, which was signed into law on December 29, 2022. The bill was included in the $1.7 trillion, 4,155-page omnibus spending bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley has questioned tech executives about their companies&rsquo; potential compliance with Chinese law that could provide the Chinese Communist Party access to data that could endanger Americans&rsquo; privacy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public officials and pundits across the political spectrum have contended that TikTok amounts to a national security concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1191863214096703489"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1191863214096703489</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play 0:00-0:50</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Hawley and Scott proposed their legislation to ban TikTok on federal government devices, many states, such as Georgia, Montana, Alabama, and Iowa, have moved to ban the controversial Chinese social media app off of their state government devices.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President Mike Pence discovered classified documents in Indiana home</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President Mike Pence informed Congress on Tuesday that he discovered documents bearing classified markings from his time as vice president in his Carmel, Indiana, home on Jan. 16.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the revelations that classified documents from President Joe Biden's tenure as vice president were found at the Penn Biden Center think tank and Wilmington, Delaware, Pence's team conducted searches of Pence's Indiana home and the office of his political advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his team, Pence informed the National Archives on Jan. 18 that a small number of potential classified documents were found in two small boxes. Another two boxes contained copies of vice presidential papers. The National Archives then informed the FBI, per standard procedure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence attorney Greg Jacob wrote on Jan. 18 to Acting Director Kate Dillon McClure of the White House Liaison Division National Archives and Records Administration to inform her of the papers "containing classified markings."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the documents with classified markings were discovered, they were immediately put into a safe, according to the Pence team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documents were collected by the FBI at Pence's home in Carmel, Indiana, on Thursday evening, Jan. 19. Pence was in Washington, D.C., for the annual March for Life when the FBI collected the documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence's team said that although the documents bear classified markings, the Department of Justice or the agency that issued the documents will need to make a final determination on whether the documents are considered classified or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a letter from Jacob to Chief Operating Officer William Bosanko of the National Archives and Records Administration on Jan. 22, the DOJ departed from its standard procedures that it ran with Biden when it requested direct possession of the documents on Jan. 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other documents that were not identified as potential classified documents were driven from Indiana to the National Archives in Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No classified docs were found at Pence's Advancing American Freedom office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Oversight Committee confirmed to Fox News Digital that Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., was notified by Pence's team Tuesday regarding the discovery of classified documents in his personal residence.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British MPs call for probe into massive spike in deaths</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 3,000 more Britons are dying than average on a weekly basis, and it&rsquo;s not Covid-19 that&rsquo;s responsible</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubled by national statistics showing 20% excess deaths per week, UK MPs have demanded an investigation, the Daily Mail reported on Tuesday. Unlike the last time excess deaths reached such levels, during the second Covid-19 wave, few of these deaths could be attributed to the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking before the House of Commons on Tuesday, Conservative MP Esther McVey skewered Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty for blaming the spike in non-Covid excess deaths on &ldquo;patients not getting statins or blood pressure medicines during the pandemic,&rdquo; pointing out that the monthly figures for statin prescriptions had remained constant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Where is the evidence? And if there isn&rsquo;t one, what is causing these excess deaths?&rdquo; she asked, demanding the minister &ldquo;commit to an urgent and thorough investigation of the matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour shadow public health minister Andrew Gwynne described health secretary Steve Barclay as &ldquo;part man, part ostrich&rdquo; over his refusal to confront the issue, accusing PM Rishi Sunak&rsquo;s government of &ldquo;denial and buck-passing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There were 50,000 more deaths than we would have otherwise expected in 2022,&rdquo; he told the House of Commons on Tuesday. &ldquo;Excluding the pandemic, that&rsquo;s the worst figure since 1951.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Office for National Statistics, 2,837 more people died in the second week of January than normal in England and Wales, with just 5% of those deaths being attributable to Covid-19.e</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time excess deaths were so high, during the second week of February 2021, Covid-19 deaths made up 37% of the total. Nor is the statistic an outlier &ndash; the last two weeks of December saw 21% and 20% excess deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal College of Emergency Medicine reported as many as 500 people a week are dying because they cannot receive emergency treatment in time. A record 54,532 people waited more than 12 hours in emergency departments to actually be admitted to the hospital once the decision was made to admit them, according to NHS data, and only 65% of patients were seen within four hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Whitty warned that &ldquo;postponement of elective and semi-elective care and screening&rdquo; due to lockdowns and NHS delays would result in another wave of mortality after Covid-19 had largely subsided, with undiagnosed cancers and other chronic conditions claiming a larger than usual number of victims.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrats consider wealth tax &mdash; including for people who moved out of state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California lawmakers are pushing legislation that would impose a new tax on the state's wealthiest residents &mdash; even if they've already moved to another part of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblyman Alex Lee, a progressive Democrat, last week introduced a bill in the California State Legislature that would impose an extra annual 1.5% tax on those with a "worldwide net worth" above $1 billion, starting as early as January 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 2026, the threshold for being taxed would drop: those with a worldwide net worth exceeding $50 million would be hit with a 1% annual tax on wealth, while billionaires would still be taxed 1.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide wealth extends beyond annual income to include diverse holdings such as farm assets, arts and other collectibles, and stocks and hedge fund interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is a modified version of a wealth tax approved in the California Assembly in 2020, which the Democrat-led state Senate declined to pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current version just introduced includes measures to allow California to impose wealth taxes on residents even years after they left the state and moved elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exit taxes aren't new in California. But this bill also includes provisions to create contractual claims tied to the assets of a wealthy taxpayer who doesn't have the cash to pay their annual wealth tax bill because most of their assets aren't easily turned into cash. This claim would require the taxpayer to make annual filings with California's Franchise Tax Board and eventually pay the wealth taxes owed, even if they've moved to another state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California was one of several blue states last week to unveil bills to impose new wealth taxes. The other states were Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York and Washington. Each state's proposal contained a different tax approach, but they all centered around the same basic idea: the rich must pay more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. However, he's made public statements echoing the message that wealthier residents should pay higher taxes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Where is the evidence? And if there isn&rsquo;t one, what is causing these excess deaths?&rdquo; she asked, demanding the minister &ldquo;commit to an urgent and thorough investigation of the matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour shadow public health minister Andrew Gwynne described health secretary Steve Barclay as &ldquo;part man, part ostrich&rdquo; over his refusal to confront the issue, accusing PM Rishi Sunak&rsquo;s government of &ldquo;denial and buck-passing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There were 50,000 more deaths than we would have otherwise expected in 2022,&rdquo; he told the House of Commons on Tuesday. &ldquo;Excluding the pandemic, that&rsquo;s the worst figure since 1951.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Office for National Statistics, 2,837 more people died in the second week of January than normal in England and Wales, with just 5% of those deaths being attributable to Covid-19.e</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time excess deaths were so high, during the second week of February 2021, Covid-19 deaths made up 37% of the total. Nor is the statistic an outlier &ndash; the last two weeks of December saw 21% and 20% excess deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal College of Emergency Medicine reported as many as 500 people a week are dying because they cannot receive emergency treatment in time. A record 54,532 people waited more than 12 hours in emergency departments to actually be admitted to the hospital once the decision was made to admit them, according to NHS data, and only 65% of patients were seen within four hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Whitty warned that &ldquo;postponement of elective and semi-elective care and screening&rdquo; due to lockdowns and NHS delays would result in another wave of mortality after Covid-19 had largely subsided, with undiagnosed cancers and other chronic conditions claiming a larger than usual number of victims.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrats consider wealth tax &mdash; including for people who moved out of state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California lawmakers are pushing legislation that would impose a new tax on the state's wealthiest residents &mdash; even if they've already moved to another part of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblyman Alex Lee, a progressive Democrat, last week introduced a bill in the California State Legislature that would impose an extra annual 1.5% tax on those with a "worldwide net worth" above $1 billion, starting as early as January 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 2026, the threshold for being taxed would drop: those with a worldwide net worth exceeding $50 million would be hit with a 1% annual tax on wealth, while billionaires would still be taxed 1.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide wealth extends beyond annual income to include diverse holdings such as farm assets, arts and other collectibles, and stocks and hedge fund interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is a modified version of a wealth tax approved in the California Assembly in 2020, which the Democrat-led state Senate declined to pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current version just introduced includes measures to allow California to impose wealth taxes on residents even years after they left the state and moved elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exit taxes aren't new in California. But this bill also includes provisions to create contractual claims tied to the assets of a wealthy taxpayer who doesn't have the cash to pay their annual wealth tax bill because most of their assets aren't easily turned into cash. This claim would require the taxpayer to make annual filings with California's Franchise Tax Board and eventually pay the wealth taxes owed, even if they've moved to another state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California was one of several blue states last week to unveil bills to impose new wealth taxes. The other states were Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York and Washington. Each state's proposal contained a different tax approach, but they all centered around the same basic idea: the rich must pay more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. However, he's made public statements echoing the message that wealthier residents should pay higher taxes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The working class has shouldered the tax burden for too long," Lee wrote in a tweet. "The ultra-rich are paying little to nothing by hoarding their wealth through assets. Time to end that."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Lee, the tax would affect 0.1% of California households and generate an additional $21.6 billion in state revenue, which would go to the state general fund. California has among the highest taxes of any state in the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates argue that the money could boost funding for schools, housing and other social programs. Perhaps more importantly, however, Lee hopes it could help address California's massive $22.5 billion budget deficit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is how we can keep addressing our budgetary issues," he told the Los Angeles Times. "Basically, we could plug the entire hole."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, experts counter that the bill will have the exact opposite effect through high administrative costs and by causing an exodus of people to flee the state.</span></p>
