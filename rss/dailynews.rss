<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/27/talks-under-way-to-extend-israel-hamas-ceasefire-as-return-to-fighting-looms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/27/talks-under-way-to-extend-israel-hamas-ceasefire-as-return-to-fighting-looms</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Talks under way to extend Israel-Hamas ceasefire as return to fighting looms</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talks are under way to extend the temporary ceasefire in Gaza, with Hamas and Israel both saying they would like to see further releases of hostages in return for freedom for more Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the ceasefire is due to expire, threatening a return to the bloody fighting and bombardment that has devastated swaths of Gaza, killed many thousands of civilians and caused an acute humanitarian crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third release of prisoners and of mostly Israeli hostages held in Gaza by Hamas took place without major problems on Sunday night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel and Hamas have each raised concerns over the lists of hostages and Palestinian prisoners due to be released on Monday, which Qatari mediators are now working to resolve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There is a slight issue with today&rsquo;s lists. The Qataris are working with both sides to &hellip; avoid delays,&rdquo; an official briefed on the matter said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventeen hostages were released by Hamas on Sunday, including a Russian national and three Thai nationals. The Israelis were all women or children. Thirty-nine Palestinian prisoners, mostly children, were freed from Israeli jails, authorities said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said he did not want to end the ceasefire but pledged that Israel would resume its military offensive in Gaza at the end of the truce.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netanyahu, who has promised Israelis he will &ldquo;crush&rdquo; Hamas, said he would welcome an extension to allow the release of 10 additional hostages every day in return for freedom for 30 Palestinian prisoners, as agreed under the original deal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israeli officials insist they will not call off their offensive until they are certain that Hamas no longer poses a threat to Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden said on Sunday that his administration would &ldquo;continue to remain personally engaged to see that this deal is fully implemented and work to extend the deal as well&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local media in Israel reported optimism among senior officials that the truce, which was the result of several weeks of complex indirect negotiations mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt, would be extended.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixty-two of the more than 240 hostages held by Hamas since last month have been released, one hostage was freed by Israeli forces, and two were found dead inside Gaza. A total of 117 Palestinians have been freed since the truce began.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 13,000 and 15,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli offensive launched after the Hamas attack, roughly two-thirds of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. More than 1 million people have been forced from their homes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UN says the truce has made it possible to scale up the delivery of food, water and medicine to the largest volume since the start of the war. But the 160 to 200 trucks a day is still less than half what Gaza was importing before the fighting, while humanitarian needs have soared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details have emerged of the conditions of the detention of some hostages. Local media has reported shortages of food and medicine, and cramped accommodation possibly underground, but no physical mistreatment. According to one report, a former hostage has told his friends that his captors had brought other children to play with him while he was in captivity. Some learned of the fate of relatives from Hebrew-language radio networks they could listen to. Two teenagers learned that their mother had been killed and their father remained missing only when released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls from the hostages&rsquo; families to prioritise their release have sharpened the dilemma facing Israel&rsquo;s leaders as they seek to reconcile the military offensive with the goal of freeing all of the captives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/11/23/new-biden-rule-reveals-transgender-movements-endgame-no-dissenting-parents-allowed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/11/23/new-biden-rule-reveals-transgender-movements-endgame-no-dissenting-parents-allowed/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lack of &lsquo;Affirmation&rsquo; Is Child Abuse: New Biden Rule Applies Transgender Standard to Foster Care</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transgender standard is set to become a litmus test for parenthood, according to the logic of a new policy working its way through the Department of Health and Human Services under President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new rule in HHS&rsquo; Administration for Children and Families would apply the idea that any lack of &ldquo;affirmation&rdquo; constitutes a form of child abuse to foster care placements. Once that idea takes root in foster care, child protective services agencies might start applying it more broadly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule would reinterpret the Social Security Act, which requires agencies to ensure that each child in foster care receives &ldquo;safe and proper&rdquo; care. The rule would lay out steps agencies must take to meet that requirement for &ldquo;LGBTQI+ children,&rdquo; defined as kids who &ldquo;identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, as well as children who are non-binary, or have non-conforming gender identity or expression.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before agencies place a child with a foster parent, known as a &ldquo;provider,&rdquo; that person must &ldquo;establish an environment free of hostility, mistreatment, or abuse based on the child&rsquo;s LGBTQI+ status;&rdquo; receive training &ldquo;to be prepared with the appropriate knowledge and skills to provide for the needs of the child related to the child&rsquo;s self-identified sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression;&rdquo; and must be able to &ldquo;facilitate the child&rsquo;s access to age-appropriate resources, services, and activities that support their health and well-being.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Ethics and Public Policy Center&rsquo;s Rachel Morrison pointed out for The Federalist Society, the rule does not define &ldquo;hostility,&rdquo; &ldquo;mistreatment,&rdquo; or &ldquo;abuse.&rdquo; However, it does clarify that &ldquo;a provider who attempted to undermine, suppress, or change the sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression of a child, including through the use of so-called &lsquo;conversion therapy,&rsquo; would not be a safe and appropriate placement.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed rule cites medical associations such as the American Psychological Association to claim that efforts to &ldquo;undermine, suppress, or change&rdquo; sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression &ldquo;are not supported by evidence and have been rejected as harmful.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule does not acknowledge that gender ideology has infiltrated these medical associations and that many doctors&mdash;including those who once embraced gender ideology&mdash;have warned against confusing children on their gender and putting them on a path to mutilating their own bodies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Stephen B. Levine, a psychiatrist and early proponent of transgender medical interventions, joined and briefly helped lead the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association, which later became the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, the central medical group that organizations such as the American Psychiatric Association rely upon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European countries, long considered more &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; than the U.S., have found a lack of evidence for medical interventions on children and are recommending a &ldquo;watchful waiting&rdquo; approach for minors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Levine argues that &ldquo;affirming&rdquo; a transgender identity is a &ldquo;powerful psychotherapeutic intervention&rdquo; that will set kids on the path to mutilation and sterilization&mdash;long before they have any concept about what their own fertility means.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Biden&rsquo;s proposed new rule, any potential foster parent who aims to protect a child from this confusion and damage may soon face expulsion from the program. That means the process will be designed to weed out guardians who actually would take good care of the kids and enable guardians who would assist in harming them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California&rsquo;s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a bill turning California into a &ldquo;sanctuary state&rdquo; for &ldquo;gender-affirming care,&rdquo; which the law defines as an absolute right. The law gives California courts the ability to award custody over a child if someone removes the child from his or her parents in another state in order to obtain such &ldquo;care&rdquo; for that child despite the parents&rsquo; disagreement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/27/businesses-diversity-equity-inclusion-economic-uncertainty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/27/businesses-diversity-equity-inclusion-economic-uncertainty/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Businesses Ditch &lsquo;Diversity&rsquo; Initiatives In Droves Amid Economic Uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives lost steam in 2023 compared to previous years as companies increasingly shift resources due to tightening economic condition</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total percentage of American organizations with a DEI budget dropped 4 percentage points, from 58% in 2022 to 54% in 2023, while the number of organizations with a DEI strategy fell 9 points in that same time frame, according to a report from a consulting firm. DEI initiatives in the workplace gained huge traction following the death of George Floyd, which encouraged companies to divert resources to the practice, but now &ldquo;external forces,&rdquo; including tightening economic conditions as well as public and judicial pressure, are pushing back on those efforts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;After two years of unprecedented investment sparked by 2020&rsquo;s racial justice movement, this year, global momentum around DEI slowed,&rdquo; according to the report from Paradigm. &ldquo;There are a number of headwinds contributing to this shift: the first is economic uncertainty that not only led to reduced spending across the board, it also firmly shifted the power balance back to employers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the decline in funding, there was a 6-point increase in the number of companies that had a senior DEI leader and an 8-point increase in organizations that had goals related to representation for women in leadership from 2022 to 2023, according to Paradigm. A total of 20% of companies in 2023 had goals related to increasing employment related to race or ethnicity, which is a 4-point increase year-over-year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift follows concerns from companies that the Supreme Court could target DEI and race-based hiring in the workplace the same way it struck down race-based admissions at colleges and universities earlier this year. A pair of decisions by the Supreme Court in June involving Harvard and the University of North Carolina cumulatively ruled that using race as a factor in college admissions is not permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Over the past several months, we&rsquo;ve heard from a number of HR leaders who are de-emphasizing data and analytics as a part of their DEI efforts, in response to the changing legal landscape and increased scrutiny on DEI efforts,&rdquo; according to the report from Paradigm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 26% of companies examine the final results of hiring by race or ethnicity, while 33% analyze promotions in the same manner, according to Paradigm. Around 36% of organizations measured the attrition rate of their employees by race or ethnicity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses pulled back from hiring in October, adding only 150,000 jobs for the month compared to 297,000 in September, while unemployment ticked up to 3.9% from 3.8%. The Leading Economic Index predicted that 2024 will only see 0.8% in the U.S. economy due to a possible recession.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/26/business/ny-retailers-blast-hochul-over-theft-which-has-cost-stores-4-4-billion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/11/26/business/ny-retailers-blast-hochul-over-theft-which-has-cost-stores-4-4-billion/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NY retailers lost $4.4 billion due to organized shoplifting rings in 2022: group</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers across New York state say there&rsquo;s no end in sight to the rising epidemic of organized shoplifting rings &mdash; and warn it could lead to more store closures, increased costs for consumers and threats of violence against store employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Store owners said they lost $4.4 billion last year as a result of retail theft &mdash; which they say adds to the urgency for Gov. Kathy Hochul to crack down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hochul vetoed a bipartisan bill last week &mdash; to the chagrin of store owners &mdash; that would have created a task force to combat organized theft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hochul rejected a proposal that would have created a 15-member panel made up of experts appointed by the governor, Legislature and the state attorney general that would have put together a list of recommendations to respond to retail theft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Retail Council of New York State, the Albany-based lobbying group which represents retailers statewide, said it was &ldquo;extremely disappointed&rdquo; by Hochul&rsquo;s veto.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa O&rsquo;Connor, the president and CEO of the group, released a statement saying that she urged the governor to take &ldquo;immediate action&rdquo; so as to formulate &ldquo;an effective, collaborative response to this problem.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;She made it abundantly clear that retail theft prevention will be a priority for her administration, and we look forward to working with her to achieve results,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Hochul said that adopting the proposal would have cost the state $35 million &mdash; an expenditure that wasn&rsquo;t allotted in the most recent budget.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement officials from New York City to Albany to Syracuse have reported increases in incidents of retail theft &mdash; blaming the spike on progressive prosecutors who encourages criminal behavior with lenient punishment for shoplifters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the chief of police in Syracuse said that the city has seen a 55% spike in shoplifting since 2021 &mdash; and that&rsquo;s a conservative estimate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That number is likely higher because businesses often don&rsquo;t report it &mdash; but they do continue to express concerns,&rdquo; Syracuse Police Chief Joe Cecile said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far this year, the Albany Police Department has fielded 23 calls for larcenies at a single Stewart&rsquo;s convenience store on Central Avenue &mdash; up from 14 at the same time in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rash of retail thefts at the location forced the owner to shut down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A New York Police Department spokesperson pointed to crime statistics showing that there were more than 93,000 incidents of petty larceny through the end of October &mdash; which is 29% higher compared to the same period two years ago but 5% lower compared to the same period last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around one-third of all shoplifting arrests in the five boroughs last year involved just 327 people who were collectively arrested and re-arrested a total of more than 6,000 times, according to the NYPD.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These 327 alleged shoplifters targeted 18 department stores and seven chain pharmacy locations, which accounted for 20% of all complaints, the NYPD said.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, November 22nd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pub Membership Plug:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Houses, or Pubs, are not just places to drink beer, wine, cider, or even something a little stronger. It is also a unique social center, very often the focus of community life in villages, towns, and cities throughout the length and breadth of the world. We here at CrossPolitic hope to emulate that for you and yours. That&rsquo;s why you should grab yourself a pub membership at fightlaughfeast.com&hellip; we need you on this ride with us. So pull up a chair, grab a pint, and join us on this ride at fightlaughfeast.com - that&rsquo;s fightlaughfeast.com.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladies and gentlemen, we start today&rsquo;s news brief with a broken record to announce!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trans-swimmer-breaks-nj-college-record-switching-mens-team-womens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trans-swimmer-breaks-nj-college-record-switching-mens-team-womens</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trans swimmer breaks New Jersey college record after switching from men's team to women's</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, yes&hellip; Lia Thomas 2.0. Mediocre men striking again!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A transgender swimmer at Ramapo College of New Jersey broke a women's school record over the weekend after competing for the men's team for three years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meghan Cortez-Fields won first place and broke a school record in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 57.22 at the Cougar Splash Invitational, a two-day meet between six schools in Dallas, Pennsylvania. She also came in first place in the 200-yard individual medley and earned second place in the 200-yard butterfly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ramapo swim team congratulated Cortez-Fields on Instagram for breaking the school record but deleted the post after former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines drew attention to meet results on X.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Those who choose to remain blind to the injustice of allowing mediocre male athletes to become record-breaking female athletes are either incompetent or misogynists. There is no in-between anymore," Gaines, an ambassador for the Independent Women's Forum, told Fox News. "Women are being asked to smile and step aside and allow these men onto our teams all the while stripping us of opportunities, privacy, and safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Ramapo spokesperson told Fox News the school "supports all of our student-athletes."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The original post of Meghan&rsquo;s achievement was deleted by a peer who wanted to protect their teammate from insulting comments on the post," the spokesperson continued. "The College continues to post team and individual student-athlete achievements for all programs on our Athletics website."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cortez-Fields swam on Ramapo&rsquo;s men's team for three years before moving to the women&rsquo;s team this season as a senior. Last year, she told The Ramapo News she admired Lia Thomas, the trans-University of Pennsylvania swimmer who won an NCAA Championship in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some hailed Thomas for her bravery, while others, like Gaines, accused her of robbing biological females of opportunities to compete and win.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cortez-Fields has won at least one heat in three of the four women's meets so far this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/20/trans-athlete-who-seriously-injured-female-player-quits-team-after-opponents-refuse-play-against-him/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/11/20/trans-athlete-who-seriously-injured-female-player-quits-team-after-opponents-refuse-play-against-him/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trans Athlete Who Seriously Injured Female Player Quits Team After Opponents Refuse to Play Against Him</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A male-born transgender athlete has quit a British soccer team when faced with opposing teams refusing to play against his team after he broke an opponent&rsquo;s knee during a match. But even after quitting, the trans player is threatening to sue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents had refused to play against Francesca Needham, 30, after he broke a female player&rsquo;s knee as she tried to block his shot. Many claimed they were &ldquo;terrified&rdquo; to face Needham on the field, according to the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needham ultimately resigned from the Rossington Main Ladies team in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, saying he did so for the good of the team after many opponents refused to play them. But he was not happy to fade off into the sunset.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement to the team&rsquo;s Facebook page, Needham decried the fact that he &ldquo;faced challenges from teams unwilling to play against us while I am on the field.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to warn about legal action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This unfortunate circumstance has prompted me to investigate pursuing a case of discrimination, as I believe it represents a breach of a code of conduct regarding diversity and inclusion, as well as safeguarding of adults in football established by both the Football Association and the Sheffield and Hallamshire Women and Girls League,&rdquo; he wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It was obvious,&rdquo; the manager told the Mail. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the FA allowed it to happen but didn&rsquo;t let anyone know. She&rsquo;s quite a big, strong player. People have refused to play because they are worried about the safety of the players.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;My players were backing out of challenges as psychologically it&rsquo;s quite a big thing when you are playing against a biological man, it&rsquo;s quite scary. They were terrified,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another league manager said that he has teenagers on his team, and parents were not happy over Needham&rsquo;s inclusion.</span></p>

<p><strong>Bombshell Report: J6 Footage Shows Capitol Police Officers Firing Rubber Bullets at Peaceful Protesters</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what could possibly be a major revelation related to the J6 riot at the U.S. Capitol building, a recent report suggests that Capitol Police fired rubber bullets into a peaceful crowd of Trump supporters during the incident. If true, this development raises serious questions about the potential role of law enforcement in the escalation of violence on that day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Events published a report detailing an interview between conservative commentator Jack Posobiec and conservative activist Raheem Kassam, who were both present near the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021. The report claimed that new footage released by House Speaker Mike Johnson shows that Capitol Police, at least in one instance, opened fire on a crowd of peaceful protesters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New footage from January 6, 2021, released by Speaker Mike Johnson, reveals that Capitol Police fired rubber bullets and other projectiles into the non-violent crowd that was protesting outside of the building, inciting chaos and confusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Posobiec and Raheem Kassam were reporting on the grounds in Washington DC that day, walking towards the Capitol when they heard flash bangs go off at around 1:10 pm EST, right around the time President Donald Trump&rsquo;s speech was ending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posobiec hosted Kassam on his show, Human Events, Monday to recount the events and timeline of the day from their perspective now that these new revelations have finally come to light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raheem recalled hearing a bang for the first time and initially thought it sounded like &ldquo;pallets falling off of the back of a truck&rdquo; before quickly getting a better view from a rooftop of the scuffle unfolding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1726698078399308152"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1726698078399308152</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The footage showed law enforcement firing non-lethal rounds into a crowd that was protesting outside the Capitol building, which incited chaos and confusion among the participants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Speaker Johnson announced the release of all the J6 footage, explaining that it would allow people &ldquo;to see for themselves what happened that day, rather than having to rely upon the interpretations of a small group of government officials,&rdquo; a thinly veiled dig at the Democratic House Select Committee that was formed shortly after the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Kassam&rsquo;s claims are true and it is verified by further investigation, it would further wreck the narrative spun by Democrats and others on the left about the matter. It would mean that law enforcement is, at least in part, responsible for the violence that occurred at the Capitol building.</span></p>

<p><strong>Truth Social Files Massive Defamation Lawsuit against 20 Leftist Media Outlets</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump-owned social media company Truth Social filed a defamation lawsuit on Monday against 20 leftist media outlets and two social media companies for defamation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiff Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp sued the following outlets:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood Reporter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Miami Herald</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling Stone</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hill</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit alleges:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;An unprecedented and seemingly coordinated media campaign by no less than 20 major media outlets, to attack Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (&ldquo;TMTG&rdquo;) and its social media platform, Truth Social, by falsely reporting that TMTG had lost $73 million.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit claimed the number was &ldquo;an utter fabrication&rdquo; and that each defendant, &ldquo;in apparent coordination,&rdquo; published the number almost in unison.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit claims the outlets sourced an SEC filing, but that $73 million loss amount is not contained in the cited filing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truth Social alleges that this was &ldquo;a coordinated effort&rdquo; to damage its reputation and hinder an anticipated merger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit contends:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;All defendants ran nearly identical headlines that reported some variation of &lsquo;Trump&rsquo;s Truth Social&rsquo; having lost &lsquo;$73 million.'&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit states the false reports &ldquo;deeply harmed&rdquo; Truth Social as it had the effect of &ldquo;eroding faith in the company&rsquo;s operations and management.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also adds that it made it &ldquo;more difficult&rdquo; for the company to raise additional funds ahead of its anticipated merger, which is currently pending with the SEC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Truth Social just filed an unprecedented defamation lawsuit incorporating twenty media companies. The tide is finally turning, corporate media and activists are going to feel the heat.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Elon Musk has initiated a &ldquo;thermonuclear lawsuit&rdquo; against the George Soros-backed Media Matters for America.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement attached to a post on X, Musk said:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This week, Media Matters for America posted a story that completely misrepresented the real user experience on X in another attempt to undermine freedom of speech and mislead advertisers.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supreme Court won&rsquo;t hear Derek Chauvin&rsquo;s appeal of George Floyd murder conviction</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court said Monday that it would not hear former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin&rsquo;s appeal of his second-degree murder conviction in the May 2020 death of George Floyd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chauvin was found guilty by a state court in April 2021 and sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison in connection with Floyd&rsquo;s May 25, 2020, death, which triggered riots across the country and a prolonged debate on race relations in America.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high court did not specify why it declined to take up the appeal and did not indicate whether any justices would have heard the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chauvin, 47, is also appealing his conviction and 21-year sentence on separate federal charges in connection with Floyd&rsquo;s death. Those punishments were not considered by the high court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ex-cop&rsquo;s lawyers had argued their client was denied a fair trial due to the publicity surrounding the case and concerns about potential violence if he was acquitted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mr. Chauvin&rsquo;s case shows the profound difficulties trial courts have to ensure a criminal defendant&rsquo;s right to an impartial jury consistently when extreme cases arise,&rdquo; Chauvin&rsquo;s legal team told the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This was particularly true here when the jurors themselves had a vested interest in finding Mr. Chauvin guilty in order to avoid further rioting in the community in which they lived and the possible threat of physical harm to them or their families.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately nine minutes of harrowing cellphone footage showed Chauvin placing his knee on Floyd&rsquo;s neck despite pleas from the 46-year-old black man that he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floyd was being arrested for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill when Chauvin confronted him. A medical examiner concluded that recent methamphetamine and fentanyl use may have contributed to his death as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chauvin&rsquo;s legal team had argued his case to the Minnesota Court of Appeals, but that court upheld his conviction back in April and declined to give him a new trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in July, the highest court in Minnesota upheld the lower court rulings, which led to the request to the US Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nine-member Supreme Court receives somewhere around 7,000 case requests on average every year and typically only accepts between 90 and 150 of them.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Buttigieg promises less chaos for travelers as 2022 nightmare season lurks in memories</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said this Thanksgiving travel season is expected to be one of the busiest in U.S. history, but travelers can anticipate fewer flight cancellations than they've seen in recent years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking alongside Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Mike Whitaker at a Monday news conference, Buttigieg said, &ldquo;We are seeing more people flying than ever with fewer cancellations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Airspace System is reporting the lowest cancellation rates in five years. Flight cancellations are down to 1.3% so far in 2023, compared to 2.3% in 2022, according to preliminary data from the Aviation System Performance Metrics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airlines have made some improvements from post-pandemic complications that were seen in Southwest&rsquo;s 2022 holiday travel disaster. Canceled and delayed flights affected an estimated 2 million passengers, and the company lost around $220 million in the final three months of last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FAA is investigating multiple domestic airlines for unrealistic scheduling of flights, including Southwest&rsquo;s December meltdown.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In the Southwest case, there was a huge volume of passengers impacted, which means there's been a huge volume of work for the team to go through,&rdquo; Buttigieg said. &ldquo;But I can tell you that it's underway and that we intend to send a continued signal that airlines need to only schedule the flights that they can serve.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I want to remind the industry that unrealistic scheduling is prohibited under the law,&rdquo; Buttigieg added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitaker said skies will remain extremely busy like last year, adding, "We will be working around the clock to make sure passengers get to their destination safely."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an earlier projection, the Transportation Security Administration said the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after are the busiest travel days. TSA is expecting to screen 2.6 million passengers on Tuesday, 2.7 million passengers on Wednesday, and 2.9 million passengers on Sunday, the busiest travel day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We expect this holiday season to be our busiest ever. In 2023, we have already seen seven of the top 10 busiest travel days in TSA&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in a press release last week. &ldquo;We are ready for the anticipated volumes and are working closely with our airline and airport partners to make sure we are prepared for this busy holiday travel season."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michigan Township Declares Itself a 'Second Amendment Sanctuary,' Promptly Forms Militia</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Biden Border Crisis continues unchecked, Chicago and New York City recently made news with their efforts to push back against the shipping of illegal aliens to their respective "sanctuary cities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holton Township Board of Trustees in Michigan's Muskegon County last Tuesday adopted a resolution declaring the township a "Second Amendment Sanctuary" and also adopted an addendum establishing a township militia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-explanatory, on the surface:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas, the Holton Township Board declares and confirms to express its intent to stand as a Sanctuary Township for Second Amendment rights, and to oppose, within the limits of the Constitution of the United States and the Commonwealth of Michigan, any efforts to unconstitutionally restrict such rights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holton Township officials made clear to the media that the resolution means the township will not enforce red flag laws restricting firearms or ammunition possession.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Have long been promoted by the left] as a way to prevent gun violence by allowing law enforcement to temporarily seize firearms from individuals deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. While this may sound like a good idea on the surface, there are several compelling reasons not to rely on this approach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, red flag laws violate due process and the constitutional rights of gun owners. Under these laws, individuals can have their firearms confiscated based solely on the suspicion of a third party, without being given the opportunity to defend themselves or even be heard in court. This is a clear violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures, and guarantee due process of law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, red flag laws are inherently subjective and can be easily abused. The criteria for determining who is a &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; individual are often vague and open to interpretation, leaving room for personal bias and political agendas to influence the decision-making process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, in the case of the Holton County Township Board: "Not in our township. Not on our watch."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Militia Public Security Act addendum states the township is adopting &ldquo;policies necessary for the security and rights of Holton Township residents,&rdquo; including a militia compromised of everyday citizens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal residents of the township are eligible to join the militia and may make their intentions known by acknowledging their intent on social media or stating their intent by letter to the Township Militia. Restrictions include:</span></p>

<p><strong>Taiwan Reports Chinese Aircraft Threatening Airspace</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan reported renewed Chinese military activity around the island on Sunday, with nine aircraft crossing the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait and warships carrying out "combat readiness patrols."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratically-governed Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained for the past four years of regular Chinese military patrols and drills near the island, as Beijing seeks to pressure Taipei over its sovereignty claims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco last week for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, where he met U.S. President Joe Biden, the scale of that military activity around Taiwan had scaled off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Taiwan's defense ministry reported that starting onSunday morning it had detected nine Chinese aircraft crossing the Taiwan Strait's median line, which had previously served as an unofficial barrier between the two and which Chinese planes now regularly fly over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aircraft involved included Su-30 and J-10 fighters, as well as early warning and electronic warfare aircraft, the ministry said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aircraft were accompanying Chinese warships carrying out "joint combat readiness patrols" it added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan sent its own forces to monitor, the ministry said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China's defense ministry did not answer calls seeking comment. China says its activities near Taiwan are aimed at "collusion" between Taiwan separatists and the United States and to protect China's territorial integrity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan's government, which has repeatedly offered talks with China, rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims and says only the island's people can decide their future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan was a major focus of the Biden-Xi talks in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xi told Biden during their four-hour meeting on Wednesday that</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan was the biggest, most dangerous issue in U.S.-China ties, according to a senior U.S. official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 13, with the island's fraught relations with China an important topic on the campaign trail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year and a half China has staged two large-scale war games around Taiwan, though China's air force has not flown over the island or into its territorial air space.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>House Ethics Committee head to move to expel George Santos after release of damning report</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The chairman of the House Ethics Committee will move to expel Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., from Congress after the release of a damning report into the embattled Long Island Republican.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Chairman Guest feels that the evidence uncovered in the Committee&rsquo;s investigation is more than sufficient to warrant punishment, and that the most appropriate punishment is expulsion," Republican Mississippi Rep. Michael Guest's personal office told Fox News Digital on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"So, separate from the Committee process and his role as Chairman, he plans to file an expulsion resolution during tomorrow&rsquo;s 9:00 am pro forma session."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The ethics committee released a damning report that accused Santos of having "used campaign funds for personal purposes" and "engaged in fraudulent conduct," among other allegations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Guest filing the resolution on Friday tees up an expected vote on whether to boot Santos from the House sometime after lawmakers return from the Thanksgiving break on Nov. 28.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A 56-page deep dive into the allegations against Santos by the panel's Investigative subcommittee detailed campaign funds being spent at spas and luxury stores, among other questionable places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The bipartisan subcommittee unanimously agreed that Santos "knowingly caused his campaign committee to file false or incomplete reports with the Federal Election Commission; used campaign funds for personal purposes; engaged in fraudulent conduct in connection with RedStone Strategies LLC; and engaged in knowing and willful violations of the Ethics in Government Act as it relates to his Financial Disclosure (FD) Statements filed with the House."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That includes $50,000 in campaign donations that were wired to Santos' personal account on Oct. 21, 2022, and allegedly used to, among other things, "pay down personal credit card bills and other debt; make a $4,127.80 purchase at Hermes; and for smaller purchases at OnlyFans; Sephora; and for meals and for parking."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Santos also spent more than $2,200 at resorts in Atlantic City, New Jersey, from July 23, 2022, to July 24, 2022, according to the report, despite a staffer telling the subcommittee that "he was not aware of any events in Atlantic City and did not attend any campaign events in Atlantic City."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Santos posted a lengthy response to the report on X, in which he announced he would not seek re-election in 2024 and accused the House Ethics Committee of bias.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"If there was a single ounce of ETHICS in the &lsquo;Ethics committee&rsquo;, they would have not released this biased report. The Committee went to extraordinary lengths to smear myself and my legal team about me not being forthcoming (My legal bills suggest otherwise)," Santos wrote. "It is a disgusting politicized smear that shows the depths of how low our federal government has sunk. Everyone who participated in this grave miscarriage of Justice should all be ashamed of themselves."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">GOP lawmakers from New York previously moved to expel Santos earlier this month, but the effort failed along bipartisan lines. Most Democrats who said they voted to punt the measure explained they were waiting for the findings of the ethics committee report.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>China&rsquo;s Xi Receives Standing Ovation From American Business Leaders</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Chinese President Xi Jinping received a standing ovation from American business leaders during an exclusive dinner in San Francisco on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Xi met with President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in San Francisco Wednesday and had talks on a broad range of issues, including military communications, fentanyl trafficking and Taiwan. During a private dinner in the city&rsquo;s downtown Hyatt Regency hours later, Xi gave a speech about the need for China-U.S. cooperation and received praise from hundreds of high-level American business executives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;China is pursuing high-quality development, and the United States is revitalizing its economy,&rdquo; Xi said during his speech. &ldquo;There is plenty of room for our cooperation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Among the leaders at the reception and dinner were Apple CEO Tim Cook, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk and a number of executives from FedEx, Qualcomm, KKR, Blackstone and Boeing, according to The Wall Street Journal. Tickets to attend the dinner started at $2,000 per person, up to $40,000 for a chance to dine with Xi at his table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important Americans and Chinese are meeting again face to face,&rdquo; said managing director for China of McLarty Associates John L. Holden, who attended the dinner, according to The New York Times. &ldquo;This is not a magic bullet, but it is something that can provide possibilities that wouldn&rsquo;t exist otherwise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;All of you here this evening remain keenly interested to do business in China, and to find ways to advance our bilateral economic relationship,&rdquo; Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told the audience at the dinner, CNBC reported. &ldquo;I know that, because half of you have come to see me to tell me that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During his speech, Xi claimed that China is &ldquo;ready to be partners and friends&rdquo; rather than adversaries with the U.S, according to the Times. He also evoked China&rsquo;s history with the U.S., recalling American and Chinese cooperation to defeat the Japanese during World War II.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom gifted Xi a Golden State Warriors Basketball jersey during the dinner, according to a Chinese Foreign Affairs spokesperson in attendance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In his meeting with Biden hours prior, Xi agreed to reestablish military-to-military communication lines with the U.S., which had been cut off in February. Xi also agreed to take steps to &ldquo;dramatically curtail&rdquo; the creation of fentanyl precursors created in China, which often end up in Mexico to be made into completed products and are subsequently trafficked into the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden praised his Wednesday meeting with Xi and then called him a &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; minutes later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Well, look, he is,&rdquo; Biden said during a press conference Wednesday.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The White House and China&rsquo;s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-block-bridges-boston-san-francisco-rush-hour"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-block-bridges-boston-san-francisco-rush-hour</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Pro-Palestinian protesters block bridges in Boston, San Francisco during rush hour</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic on bridges in Boston and San Francisco during rush hour Thursday morning to call for a cease-fire in Gaza as Israel continues to target Hamas leadership more than a month after the militant group&rsquo;s deadly incursion into Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On the Boston University bridge, the group IfNotNow, which says it represents members of Boston&rsquo;s Jewish community, chanted "Cease-fire now!" and demanded that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., support an immediate cease-fire and use her influence to stop the Israeli government&rsquo;s military action in Gaza.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The protest slowed traffic to a trickle on the bridge, which connects Boston and Cambridge, as the group held signs that said, "Let Gaza Live," and unfurled a banner across the roadway that read, "Jews say: Ceasefire now."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We care about Palestinian lives, we only want to hurt Hamas," one protester on the bridge told NBC Boston, while another said, "There can&rsquo;t be peace for Jews unless there is peace for Palestinians."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile, Pro-Palestinian protesters also shut down the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, where President Biden was courting world leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Arab Resource and Organizing Center planned the demonstration, in which protesters were heard shouting, "Free Palestine" and "We want justice." Others chained themselves to the bridge or lay in the road covered with sheets smeared with fake blood, FOX2 KTVU reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Authorities had closed one lane on the bridge as a preventative measure during the summit, the station reported, citing the California Highway Patrol.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas after the militant group launched its Oct. 7 surprise attack, in which at least 1,200 people died in Israel and around 240 were taken captive by militants back to Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">More than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The protest came as Israeli forces dropped leaflets warning Palestinians to flee parts of southern Gaza, residents said Thursday, signaling a possible expansion of their offensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/15/nolte-miserable-chicagoans-drop-mayor-brandon-johnsons-approval-rating-to-28/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/15/nolte-miserable-chicagoans-drop-mayor-brandon-johnsons-approval-rating-to-28/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Miserable Chicagoans Drop Mayor Brandon Johnson&rsquo;s Approval Rating to 28%</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Wednesday&rsquo;s glorious edition of Democrats Getting What They Voted For, newly elected Democrat Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has an approval rating of just 28 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Echelon Insights polled 800 registered voters in Chicago between October 18 and 22.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">So how is it possible that Johnson, who won a majority just seven short months ago, is now sitting with a dismal 28 percent approval rating, which is only one point higher than Lori Lightfoot (the sitting mayor he defeated) had in February 2023, which was only one month before she lost her reelection campaign?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">I think the answer to this disconnect is obvious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Chicago, dead people can vote, but dead people cannot be polled over the telephone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">When asked about Chicago&rsquo;s worst issues, 69 percent of those polled said crime. That&rsquo;s only a two-point decrease since February. Then came high taxes (31 percent) and homelessness (20 percent). Everything else was under 15 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">When asked how Mayor Johnson is doing on those top three issues, only 21 percent approved of the job he&rsquo;s doing on crime, while 66 percent disapproved. On economic development, only 32 percent approved, while 43 percent disapproved. On housing and homelessness, only 18 percent approved, while 63 percent disapproved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On the specific issue of &ldquo;management of immigrants transported to the city,&rdquo; only 23 percent approved, while 64 percent disapproved. This question relates directly to His Fraudulency, Joe Biden, throwing the southern border wide open to millions of unvetted, third-world illegal aliens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On that same question, living Chicago voters were asked, &ldquo;How do you feel about Mayor Brandon Johnson&rsquo;s proposed plan to house migrants in &lsquo;base camps&rsquo; made up of large, heated tents in various parts of Chicago?&rdquo; Only 28 percent approved, while 63 percent disapproved. Those who said they &ldquo;strongly oppose&rdquo; on this question made up nearly half, 46 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">When asked if they supported or opposed Chicago&rsquo;s status as a sanctuary city, a majority of 52 percent opposed, while 42 percent supported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In February 2023, the month before Chicago voted Lightfoot out, 28 percent said the city was headed in the right direction. That number has now dropped to just 20 percent, while 65 percent say things are headed in the wrong direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now that cash bail has been eliminated statewide, it hurts Chicago more than any other city. Only 35 percent of Chicagoans support that policy, but the Democrat governor who instituted that suicide pact won around 80 percent of the vote in Cook County, which is where Chicago sits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This poll tells us that Chicagoans are getting exactly what they voted for and are quite upset over it, which tells you just how damaged Democrats are.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey Parents File Federal Class Action Lawsuit Challenging State&rsquo;s Secret Retention of Newborn Blood for 23 Years&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of New Jersey parents teamed up with the Institute for Justice (IJ) to file a federal lawsuit challenging New Jersey&rsquo;s practice of keeping blood samples taken from newborn babies for 23 years, all without parents&rsquo; knowledge or consent. Not only does New Jersey hold onto the blood, it can use the blood samples in any manner it chooses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When babies are born in New Jersey, state law requires that blood be taken from the newborns and tested for diseases such as cystic fibrosis, hormonal deficiencies, and other immunity issues. All states perform similar tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, after the testing is over, New Jersey&rsquo;s Department of Health keeps the leftover blood for 23 years. The state does not ask parents for their consent to keep their babies&rsquo; blood, failing to even inform parents that it will hold on to the residual blood. The only way parents could learn about such retention is by proactively looking it up on one of the third-party websites listed on the bottom of the card they&rsquo;re given after the blood draw. And, once the state has the blood, it can use it however it wishes, including selling it to third parties, giving it to police without a warrant, or even selling it to the Pentagon to create a registry&mdash;as previously happened in Texas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Parents have a right to informed consent if the state wants to keep their children&rsquo;s blood for decades and use it for purposes other than screening for diseases,&rdquo; said IJ Senior Attorney Rob Frommer. &ldquo;New Jersey&rsquo;s policy of storing baby blood and DNA and using that genetic information however it wants is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of all New Jersey parents and their newborns.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs challenging this law are two Boonton parents, Erica and Jeremiah Jedynak, and Hannah Lovaglio, a Cranbury mother of two.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right that the state can enter an incredibly intimate moment, the tender days of childbirth, and take something from our children which is then held on to for 23 years,&rdquo; said Hannah. &ldquo;The lack of consent and transparency causes me to question the intent and makes me worried for my children&rsquo;s future selves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As a mother, I deserve the right to decide whether or not the government takes blood from my son and holds onto it for decades past its claimed use.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although all 50 states and the District of Columbia require blood screening for newborns, whether a state will destroy leftover newborn blood, return it, or keep it with a form of parental consent varies on a state-by-state basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What makes New Jersey&rsquo;s program so uniquely disturbing is the complete lack of safeguards for future abuse and the lack of consent, which leave the program ripe for abuse,&rdquo; said IJ Attorney Christie Hebert. &ldquo;Parents should not have to worry if the state is going to use the blood it said it was taking from their baby to test for diseases for other, unrelated purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey is not alone in facing legal issues for the lack of consent when obtaining blood and over what the state does with the blood. Texas, Minnesota, and Michigan have all faced lawsuits over their retention of blood samples without informed consent from the parents. The 2009 lawsuit in Texas resulted in the state destroying 5.3 million blood samples, and now, all blood samples obtained after 2012 must be destroyed after two years. A 2014 settlement in the Minnesota lawsuit resulted in 1.1 million blood samples being destroyed. In 2022, Michigan agreed to destroy 3 million blood spots, but that lawsuit continues to move forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredibly misleading for the state to tell parents they are simply drawing blood from their babies to test for diseases when it could be sold to third parties or used by other government agencies to build invasive databases or registries,&rdquo; said IJ Attorney Brian Morris. &ldquo;As Texas and other states have shown, these concerns aren&rsquo;t hypothetical.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden-Xi meeting to seal deals on fentanyl, military communications, White House says</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday's meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will address hard issues such as fentanyl supplies coming in from Asia and a lack of military communication, the White House said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News spoke with NSC Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell this week &mdash; Campbell was just recently nominated to become deputy secretary of state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I can tell you that President Biden intends to make very clear to President Xi to get ready. He's going to be dealing with President Biden for the next five years," Campbell told Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"These are tough diplomatic encounters," he continued. "President Biden has a lot of experience. They've known each other a long time. This is an important meeting. It'll be intense."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden and Xi shook hands in San Francisco Wednesday. One key talking point for the two world leaders is the ongoing fentanyl crisis in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The president tasked us several months ago to try to come up with some sort of progress on one of the most terrible things that is a blight on America, the fentanyl crisis," Campbell told Fox News Digital. "So we've worked over the course of several months with Chinese interlocutors demanding progress on cutting off support from precursors that are produced by Chinese companies and then shipped largely to Latin America. And then they make their way up into the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We're going to have to see how it's implemented," Campbell continued. "But so far, we believe the Chinese are going to take consequential steps that will essentially help us get a handle on really one of the most terrible drug epidemics the United States has ever faced. There's a back and forth on this. If they, in fact, make these arrests and shut down these companies, then we will be lifting a few sanctions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major concern to be addressed between Biden and Xi is the trend of increasingly common incidents between the Chinese and U.S. military. Government officials have reported that communications between China and U.S. military commands has become difficult, with Chinese military leaders refusing to meaningfully converse with their U.S. counterparts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We seek to establish responsible mechanisms that can deal with communications in a crisis to prevent escalation and inadvertence. And I believe that the Chinese will come around to see that some of this is also in their best interest as well," Campbell added.</span></p>

<p><strong>Teacher&rsquo;s Union That Encouraged Teacher Strikes Now Faces Its Own Employee Rebellion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Education Association (NEA) has a labor strike on its hands as its 48 employees protest low wages, Axios reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NEA, which represents 3 million educators, has encouraged several massive teacher strikes in past. Now, its own employees have voted unanimously to strike, claiming that wages have not risen to meet surging inflation in recent years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of NEA-affiliated Portland teachers went on strike in October over low pay and large class sizes, among other issues. The strike is ongoing. Teachers in Massachusetts and Columbus enjoyed NEA support while they went on strike last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The NEA is going to have step up and honor the values of the organization,&rdquo; the bargaining chair for the union representing the NEA&rsquo;s staff, LaToya Johnson, said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson said she hoped that the organization would give their employees the same benefits they fought for the teachers they represent to have.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;NEA has engaged in negotiations in good faith,&rdquo; an NEA spokesperson told Axios. &ldquo;[A]nd continues to apply a solutions-based approach to resolve the outstanding issues in a manner that addresses articulated priorities of AFSE while also balancing the strategic priorities of NEA and its members.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NEA, along with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to decide on when and how in-person education would be allows after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to emails obtained by Americans for Public Trust.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As &lsquo;The Marvels&rsquo; Bombs, Disney Doubles Down on Pushing LGBTQ Streaming Shows</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Walt Disney Company is rolling out more LGBTQ content as its latest superhero movie The Marvels crashed and burned at the box office on its opening weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Disney+ drama series Culprits focuses on a gay domestic relationship between two men played by Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and Kevin Vidal. The show focuses on Joe (Stewart-Jarrett), whose past criminal life threatens to re-emerge and disrupt the quiet suburban existence he has built with his male fianc&eacute; Jules (Vidal)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series &mdash; which is streaming on Disney+ in the U.K. and Hulu in the U.S. &mdash;&nbsp; also stars drag queen comedian Eddie Izzard, who now apparently goes by the name &ldquo;Suzy Eddie Izzard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Hulu is set to debut the new documentary We Live Here in the Midwest &mdash; a look at gay, transgender, and &ldquo;non-binary&rdquo; families that live in small towns and cities throughout America&rsquo;s heartland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the families profiled in the documentary are those with transgender parents. &ldquo;What my dad was feeling and why she felt like she did, was more than just her. There are more people out there who are like this,&rdquo; said one child whose father transitioned to become a &ldquo;woman.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another scene, a &ldquo;non-binary&rdquo; student discussed how she is treated in class.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The students believe that &lsquo;non-binary&rsquo; do not exist,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here right now so we do exist.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Live Here in the Midwest is set to debut on December 6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney has embraced LGBTQ messaging in its entertainment aimed at children and families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Breitbart News reported, Disney along with Netflix put out more LGBTQ content than any other studio in Hollywood in 2022, according to a GLAAD report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GLAAD said Disney released 59 films in 2022, and 24 of them were so-called &ldquo;LGBT inclusive films.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past two years, Disney has fought Florida over its anti-grooming Parental Rights in Education law, created multiple transgender characters for its children&rsquo;s shows, put gay characters at the center of its big-budget movies, and even launched an LGBTQ-themed apparel line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Disney eliminated 7,000 jobs worldwide as its profitability cratered. CEO Bob Iger is planning on slashing an additional $2 billion in spending in the months ahead.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Iran Expects $10 Billion Sanctions Waiver Gift from Biden</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iranian pro-regime propaganda site Tasnim News reported on Tuesday that the administration of President Joe Biden is likely to &ldquo;agree with Iran&rsquo;s getting access to $10 billion&rdquo; currently frozen under sanctions, adding to tens of billions in relief the White House has already processed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Biden administration may approve a sanctions waiver on Tuesday that will allow Iran to access at least $10 billion in previously frozen funds held in Iraq,&rdquo; the outlet declared. &ldquo;According to reports, Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Mohammad Reza Farzin held talks with his Omani counterpart last month on the acceleration of Iran&rsquo;s access to its financial resources.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasnim News made the claim based on a report published on Monday by the Washington Free Beacon that described the $10 billion in question as already under a sanctions waiver, but one set to expire on Tuesday. The initial sanctions relief was reportedly issued in July, months before the unprecedented massacre of 1,200 civilians in Israel by the Iran proxy terrorist group Hamas on October 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That mass killing &ndash; in which Hamas slaughtered children as young as infants, extensively tortured victims and desecrated corpses on camera, and took about 250 hostages &ndash; has increased pressure on the Biden administration to end sanctions relief programs that unfreeze money for Iran, allowing the government to use the unfrozen funds on legitimate needs and freeing up other funding to share with terrorist organizations such as Hamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the original report, the money represents payments made by the government of Iraq to Iran in exchange for electricity services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Trump administration first allowed Iraq to import electricity and gas from Iran, but only on the condition that the payments were kept in an escrow account in Baghdad,&rdquo; the Free Beacon explained. &ldquo;The Biden administration continued to issue that waiver, and then broadened it in July so that Iraq could move more than $10 billion outside the country, enabling Tehran to draw on the funds for its budget and humanitarian needs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iranian site Tasnim is sanctioned by the U.S. government for its close ties to the Iranian Islamist dictatorship. It was founded by members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization and a formal arm of the Iranian military, so it serves as an informal mouthpiece for the Iranian regime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The October 7 Hamas attack, which the terrorists branded the &ldquo;al-Aqsa flood,&rdquo; has renewed calls for the Biden administration to stop its policy of sanctions relief for Iran. Iran is the world&rsquo;s foremost state sponsor of terrorism and pours hundreds of millions of dollars a year into jihadist organizations threatening Israel. According to the U.S. State Department, Hamas itself receives about $100 million a year from the Iranian government. The Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah, based in Lebanon and vocally threatening attacks on Israel regularly, receives about $700 million a year from Iran.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the overwhelming evidence of coordination between Iran and groups such as Hamas, according to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), the Biden administration has granted Iran over $50 billion in sanctions relief. A month before the Israel attacks, Biden approved an agreement that gifted Iran $6 billion in sanctions relief in a single spell. In exchange for the $6 billion, which had been frozen in South Korean banks and which Washington allowed to be transferred to Iran-friendly Qatar, Iran freed five Americans it had been holding hostage in its political prisons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, shortly after the Hamas attack, the Biden administration &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; lifted all oil and gas sanctions on socialist Venezuela, in response to dictator Nicol&aacute;s Maduro&rsquo;s short-lived promise to allow a free and fair presidential election. Iran and Venezuela are close allies; Iran refines a significant percentage of its own crude in Venezuela and has helped Venezuela refurbish its dilapidated oil facilities. The two countries recently signed an agreement with the Syrian dictatorship to jointly build a new refining facility.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/nepal-bans-tiktok-disrupting-social-harmony"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/nepal-bans-tiktok-disrupting-social-harmony</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nepal bans TikTok for 'disrupting social harmony'</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepal&rsquo;s government decided to ban the popular social media app TikTok on Monday, saying it was disrupting "social harmony" in the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement was made following a Cabinet meeting. Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud said the app would be banned immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The government has decided to ban TikTok as it was necessary to regulate the use of the social media platform that was disrupting social harmony, goodwill and flow of indecent materials," Saud said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that to make social media platforms accountable, the government has asked the companies to register and open a liaison office in Nepal, pay taxes and abide by the country's laws and regulations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn't clear what triggered the ban or if TikTok had refused to comply with Nepal's requests. The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok, owned by China&rsquo;s ByteDance, has faced scrutiny in a number of countries because of concerns that Beijing could use the app to harvest user data or advance its interests. Countries including the United States, Britain and New Zealand have banned the app on government phones despite TikTok repeatedly denying that it has ever shared data with the Chinese government and would not do so if asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepal has banned all pornographic sites in 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/oregon-voters-want-to-walk-back-legalization-of-hard-drugs?utm_campaign=64487#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/oregon-voters-want-to-walk-back-legalization-of-hard-drugs?utm_campaign=64487#google_vignette</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oregon voters want to walk-back legalization of hard drugs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, voters in Oregon passed Measure 110, which decriminalized the possession of certain drugs in small quantities for personal use and shuffled revenue from cannabis taxes to resources aimed at helping addicts. Since it went into effect the following year, crime and substance use has not gone down as intended, and as a result, residents are calling for a reintroduction of criminal penalties for users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll conducted by DHM Research earlier this year revealed that more than 60 percent of Oregonians want to see the decriminalization aspect of Measure 110 repealed, though support for the use of cannabis taxes to fund treatment programs has maintained popularity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the poll, 51 percent of those surveyed said they believed Measure 110 has been bad for Oregon. Of those, 33 percent deemed it "very bad." Over 60 percent said drug addiction, homelessness, and crime had become worse in the time since it was adopted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural voters who identified as Republicans were more likely than their Democratic urban neighbors to believe that the policy has had a negative impact on the state, though a sizable proportion of every demographic said as much.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll, conducted via online survey among 500 Oregon voters between April 24 and 30, also found that drug addiction and mental health were viewed as more likely root causes of homelessness than access to affordable housing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Wall Street Journal reports, law enforcement officers across the state have found that contrary to what was expected, doing away with the threat of jail time has not resulted in more addicts seeking help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2021, while 6,000 tickets have been issued for drug possession, only 92 people have gotten in touch with the helpline to complete an assessment that would connect them with the necessary assistance. Those who fail to call are supposed to receive a $100 fine, however that is hardly ever enforced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overdoses have also continued to rise, jumping 23 percent between May 2021-2022 and May 2022-2023 to 1,500 statewide.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Man arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson, police say</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson last month, South Yorkshire Police said in a statement on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson died after sustaining a cut to the neck while playing for the Nottingham Panthers against the Sheffield Steelers in England on October 28.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sheffield coroner&rsquo;s report found that the 29-year-old &ldquo;sustained an incised wound to the neck caused by the skate of another player&rdquo; and later died in hospital as a result of the injury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our investigation launched immediately following this tragedy and we have been carrying out extensive enquiries ever since to piece together the events which led to the loss of Adam in these unprecedented circumstances,&rdquo; detective chief superintendent Becs Horsfall said in a police statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have been speaking to highly specialised experts in their field to assist in our enquiries and continue to work closely with the health and safety department at Sheffield City Council, which is supporting our ongoing investigation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police statement added that the man arrested remains in custody.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Johnson&rsquo;s death, which the Panthers described in a statement on October 29 as a &ldquo;freak accident,&rdquo; there has been increased focus on player safety in ice hockey, particularly on whether protective neck guards should be more widely worn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s death has sent shockwaves through many communities, from our local residents here in Sheffield to ice hockey fans across the world,&rdquo; Horsfall said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in Hibbing, Minnesota, Johnson started his professional career in the American Hockey League before progressing to the National Hockey League (NHL).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He featured in 13 games over two years for the Pittsburgh Penguins and also played in Sweden and Germany before joining the Panthers for the 2023-24 season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an online obituary, Johnson&rsquo;s family remembered him as a &ldquo;thoughtful, patient and genuinely authentic&rdquo; person who &ldquo;took pleasure in the small, everyday things.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the ice hockey community across the world have paid tribute to the forward, including in the city of Nottingham, where fans have laid flowers outside the Motorpoint Arena.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said on Tuesday that officers are supporting Johnson&rsquo;s family while the investigation into his death remains ongoing.</span></p>]]></description>
