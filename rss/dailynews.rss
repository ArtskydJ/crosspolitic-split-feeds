<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-ethics-committee-head-moves-to-expel-george-santos-after-release-of-damning-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-ethics-committee-head-moves-to-expel-george-santos-after-release-of-damning-report</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>House Ethics Committee head to move to expel George Santos after release of damning report</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The chairman of the House Ethics Committee will move to expel Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., from Congress after the release of a damning report into the embattled Long Island Republican.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Chairman Guest feels that the evidence uncovered in the Committee&rsquo;s investigation is more than sufficient to warrant punishment, and that the most appropriate punishment is expulsion," Republican Mississippi Rep. Michael Guest's personal office told Fox News Digital on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"So, separate from the Committee process and his role as Chairman, he plans to file an expulsion resolution during tomorrow&rsquo;s 9:00 am pro forma session."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The ethics committee released a damning report that accused Santos of having "used campaign funds for personal purposes" and "engaged in fraudulent conduct," among other allegations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Guest filing the resolution on Friday tees up an expected vote on whether to boot Santos from the House sometime after lawmakers return from the Thanksgiving break on Nov. 28.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A 56-page deep dive into the allegations against Santos by the panel's Investigative subcommittee detailed campaign funds being spent at spas and luxury stores, among other questionable places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The bipartisan subcommittee unanimously agreed that Santos "knowingly caused his campaign committee to file false or incomplete reports with the Federal Election Commission; used campaign funds for personal purposes; engaged in fraudulent conduct in connection with RedStone Strategies LLC; and engaged in knowing and willful violations of the Ethics in Government Act as it relates to his Financial Disclosure (FD) Statements filed with the House."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That includes $50,000 in campaign donations that were wired to Santos' personal account on Oct. 21, 2022, and allegedly used to, among other things, "pay down personal credit card bills and other debt; make a $4,127.80 purchase at Hermes; and for smaller purchases at OnlyFans; Sephora; and for meals and for parking."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Santos also spent more than $2,200 at resorts in Atlantic City, New Jersey, from July 23, 2022, to July 24, 2022, according to the report, despite a staffer telling the subcommittee that "he was not aware of any events in Atlantic City and did not attend any campaign events in Atlantic City."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Santos posted a lengthy response to the report on X, in which he announced he would not seek re-election in 2024 and accused the House Ethics Committee of bias.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"If there was a single ounce of ETHICS in the &lsquo;Ethics committee&rsquo;, they would have not released this biased report. The Committee went to extraordinary lengths to smear myself and my legal team about me not being forthcoming (My legal bills suggest otherwise)," Santos wrote. "It is a disgusting politicized smear that shows the depths of how low our federal government has sunk. Everyone who participated in this grave miscarriage of Justice should all be ashamed of themselves."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">GOP lawmakers from New York previously moved to expel Santos earlier this month, but the effort failed along bipartisan lines. Most Democrats who said they voted to punt the measure explained they were waiting for the findings of the ethics committee report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/16/chinas-xi-receives-standing-ovation-american-business-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/16/chinas-xi-receives-standing-ovation-american-business-leaders/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>China&rsquo;s Xi Receives Standing Ovation From American Business Leaders</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Chinese President Xi Jinping received a standing ovation from American business leaders during an exclusive dinner in San Francisco on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Xi met with President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in San Francisco Wednesday and had talks on a broad range of issues, including military communications, fentanyl trafficking and Taiwan. During a private dinner in the city&rsquo;s downtown Hyatt Regency hours later, Xi gave a speech about the need for China-U.S. cooperation and received praise from hundreds of high-level American business executives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;China is pursuing high-quality development, and the United States is revitalizing its economy,&rdquo; Xi said during his speech. &ldquo;There is plenty of room for our cooperation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Among the leaders at the reception and dinner were Apple CEO Tim Cook, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk and a number of executives from FedEx, Qualcomm, KKR, Blackstone and Boeing, according to The Wall Street Journal. Tickets to attend the dinner started at $2,000 per person, up to $40,000 for a chance to dine with Xi at his table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important Americans and Chinese are meeting again face to face,&rdquo; said managing director for China of McLarty Associates John L. Holden, who attended the dinner, according to The New York Times. &ldquo;This is not a magic bullet, but it is something that can provide possibilities that wouldn&rsquo;t exist otherwise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;All of you here this evening remain keenly interested to do business in China, and to find ways to advance our bilateral economic relationship,&rdquo; Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told the audience at the dinner, CNBC reported. &ldquo;I know that, because half of you have come to see me to tell me that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During his speech, Xi claimed that China is &ldquo;ready to be partners and friends&rdquo; rather than adversaries with the U.S, according to the Times. He also evoked China&rsquo;s history with the U.S., recalling American and Chinese cooperation to defeat the Japanese during World War II.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom gifted Xi a Golden State Warriors Basketball jersey during the dinner, according to a Chinese Foreign Affairs spokesperson in attendance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In his meeting with Biden hours prior, Xi agreed to reestablish military-to-military communication lines with the U.S., which had been cut off in February. Xi also agreed to take steps to &ldquo;dramatically curtail&rdquo; the creation of fentanyl precursors created in China, which often end up in Mexico to be made into completed products and are subsequently trafficked into the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden praised his Wednesday meeting with Xi and then called him a &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; minutes later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Well, look, he is,&rdquo; Biden said during a press conference Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoeFN1wgTdo"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Biden again calls Xi &lsquo;dictator&rsquo; after Chinese prez warns against &lsquo;turning back&rsquo; on Beijing&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoeFN1wgTdo&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Biden again calls Xi &lsquo;dictator&rsquo; after Chinese prez warns against &lsquo;turning back&rsquo; on Beijing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Play Clip</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The White House and China&rsquo;s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-block-bridges-boston-san-francisco-rush-hour"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-block-bridges-boston-san-francisco-rush-hour</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Pro-Palestinian protesters block bridges in Boston, San Francisco during rush hour</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic on bridges in Boston and San Francisco during rush hour Thursday morning to call for a cease-fire in Gaza as Israel continues to target Hamas leadership more than a month after the militant group&rsquo;s deadly incursion into Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On the Boston University bridge, the group IfNotNow, which says it represents members of Boston&rsquo;s Jewish community, chanted "Cease-fire now!" and demanded that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., support an immediate cease-fire and use her influence to stop the Israeli government&rsquo;s military action in Gaza.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The protest slowed traffic to a trickle on the bridge, which connects Boston and Cambridge, as the group held signs that said, "Let Gaza Live," and unfurled a banner across the roadway that read, "Jews say: Ceasefire now."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We care about Palestinian lives, we only want to hurt Hamas," one protester on the bridge told NBC Boston, while another said, "There can&rsquo;t be peace for Jews unless there is peace for Palestinians."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile, Pro-Palestinian protesters also shut down the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, where President Biden was courting world leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Arab Resource and Organizing Center planned the demonstration, in which protesters were heard shouting, "Free Palestine" and "We want justice." Others chained themselves to the bridge or lay in the road covered with sheets smeared with fake blood, FOX2 KTVU reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Authorities had closed one lane on the bridge as a preventative measure during the summit, the station reported, citing the California Highway Patrol.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas after the militant group launched its Oct. 7 surprise attack, in which at least 1,200 people died in Israel and around 240 were taken captive by militants back to Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">More than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The protest came as Israeli forces dropped leaflets warning Palestinians to flee parts of southern Gaza, residents said Thursday, signaling a possible expansion of their offensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/15/nolte-miserable-chicagoans-drop-mayor-brandon-johnsons-approval-rating-to-28/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/15/nolte-miserable-chicagoans-drop-mayor-brandon-johnsons-approval-rating-to-28/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Miserable Chicagoans Drop Mayor Brandon Johnson&rsquo;s Approval Rating to 28%</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Wednesday&rsquo;s glorious edition of Democrats Getting What They Voted For, newly elected Democrat Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has an approval rating of just 28 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Echelon Insights polled 800 registered voters in Chicago between October 18 and 22.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">So how is it possible that Johnson, who won a majority just seven short months ago, is now sitting with a dismal 28 percent approval rating, which is only one point higher than Lori Lightfoot (the sitting mayor he defeated) had in February 2023, which was only one month before she lost her reelection campaign?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">I think the answer to this disconnect is obvious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Chicago, dead people can vote, but dead people cannot be polled over the telephone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">When asked about Chicago&rsquo;s worst issues, 69 percent of those polled said crime. That&rsquo;s only a two-point decrease since February. Then came high taxes (31 percent) and homelessness (20 percent). Everything else was under 15 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">When asked how Mayor Johnson is doing on those top three issues, only 21 percent approved of the job he&rsquo;s doing on crime, while 66 percent disapproved. On economic development, only 32 percent approved, while 43 percent disapproved. On housing and homelessness, only 18 percent approved, while 63 percent disapproved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On the specific issue of &ldquo;management of immigrants transported to the city,&rdquo; only 23 percent approved, while 64 percent disapproved. This question relates directly to His Fraudulency, Joe Biden, throwing the southern border wide open to millions of unvetted, third-world illegal aliens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On that same question, living Chicago voters were asked, &ldquo;How do you feel about Mayor Brandon Johnson&rsquo;s proposed plan to house migrants in &lsquo;base camps&rsquo; made up of large, heated tents in various parts of Chicago?&rdquo; Only 28 percent approved, while 63 percent disapproved. Those who said they &ldquo;strongly oppose&rdquo; on this question made up nearly half, 46 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">When asked if they supported or opposed Chicago&rsquo;s status as a sanctuary city, a majority of 52 percent opposed, while 42 percent supported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In February 2023, the month before Chicago voted Lightfoot out, 28 percent said the city was headed in the right direction. That number has now dropped to just 20 percent, while 65 percent say things are headed in the wrong direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now that cash bail has been eliminated statewide, it hurts Chicago more than any other city. Only 35 percent of Chicagoans support that policy, but the Democrat governor who instituted that suicide pact won around 80 percent of the vote in Cook County, which is where Chicago sits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This poll tells us that Chicagoans are getting exactly what they voted for and are quite upset over it, which tells you just how damaged Democrats are.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://ij.org/press-release/new-jersey-parents-file-federal-class-action-lawsuit-challenging-states-secret-retention-of-newborn-blood-for-23-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://ij.org/press-release/new-jersey-parents-file-federal-class-action-lawsuit-challenging-states-secret-retention-of-newborn-blood-for-23-years/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey Parents File Federal Class Action Lawsuit Challenging State&rsquo;s Secret Retention of Newborn Blood for 23 Years&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of New Jersey parents teamed up with the Institute for Justice (IJ) to file a federal lawsuit challenging New Jersey&rsquo;s practice of keeping blood samples taken from newborn babies for 23 years, all without parents&rsquo; knowledge or consent. Not only does New Jersey hold onto the blood, it can use the blood samples in any manner it chooses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When babies are born in New Jersey, state law requires that blood be taken from the newborns and tested for diseases such as cystic fibrosis, hormonal deficiencies, and other immunity issues. All states perform similar tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, after the testing is over, New Jersey&rsquo;s Department of Health keeps the leftover blood for 23 years. The state does not ask parents for their consent to keep their babies&rsquo; blood, failing to even inform parents that it will hold on to the residual blood. The only way parents could learn about such retention is by proactively looking it up on one of the third-party websites listed on the bottom of the card they&rsquo;re given after the blood draw. And, once the state has the blood, it can use it however it wishes, including selling it to third parties, giving it to police without a warrant, or even selling it to the Pentagon to create a registry&mdash;as previously happened in Texas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Parents have a right to informed consent if the state wants to keep their children&rsquo;s blood for decades and use it for purposes other than screening for diseases,&rdquo; said IJ Senior Attorney Rob Frommer. &ldquo;New Jersey&rsquo;s policy of storing baby blood and DNA and using that genetic information however it wants is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of all New Jersey parents and their newborns.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs challenging this law are two Boonton parents, Erica and Jeremiah Jedynak, and Hannah Lovaglio, a Cranbury mother of two.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right that the state can enter an incredibly intimate moment, the tender days of childbirth, and take something from our children which is then held on to for 23 years,&rdquo; said Hannah. &ldquo;The lack of consent and transparency causes me to question the intent and makes me worried for my children&rsquo;s future selves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As a mother, I deserve the right to decide whether or not the government takes blood from my son and holds onto it for decades past its claimed use.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although all 50 states and the District of Columbia require blood screening for newborns, whether a state will destroy leftover newborn blood, return it, or keep it with a form of parental consent varies on a state-by-state basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What makes New Jersey&rsquo;s program so uniquely disturbing is the complete lack of safeguards for future abuse and the lack of consent, which leave the program ripe for abuse,&rdquo; said IJ Attorney Christie Hebert. &ldquo;Parents should not have to worry if the state is going to use the blood it said it was taking from their baby to test for diseases for other, unrelated purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey is not alone in facing legal issues for the lack of consent when obtaining blood and over what the state does with the blood. Texas, Minnesota, and Michigan have all faced lawsuits over their retention of blood samples without informed consent from the parents. The 2009 lawsuit in Texas resulted in the state destroying 5.3 million blood samples, and now, all blood samples obtained after 2012 must be destroyed after two years. A 2014 settlement in the Minnesota lawsuit resulted in 1.1 million blood samples being destroyed. In 2022, Michigan agreed to destroy 3 million blood spots, but that lawsuit continues to move forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredibly misleading for the state to tell parents they are simply drawing blood from their babies to test for diseases when it could be sold to third parties or used by other government agencies to build invasive databases or registries,&rdquo; said IJ Attorney Brian Morris. &ldquo;As Texas and other states have shown, these concerns aren&rsquo;t hypothetical.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden-Xi meeting to seal deals on fentanyl, military communications, White House says</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday's meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will address hard issues such as fentanyl supplies coming in from Asia and a lack of military communication, the White House said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News spoke with NSC Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell this week &mdash; Campbell was just recently nominated to become deputy secretary of state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I can tell you that President Biden intends to make very clear to President Xi to get ready. He's going to be dealing with President Biden for the next five years," Campbell told Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"These are tough diplomatic encounters," he continued. "President Biden has a lot of experience. They've known each other a long time. This is an important meeting. It'll be intense."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden and Xi shook hands in San Francisco Wednesday. One key talking point for the two world leaders is the ongoing fentanyl crisis in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The president tasked us several months ago to try to come up with some sort of progress on one of the most terrible things that is a blight on America, the fentanyl crisis," Campbell told Fox News Digital. "So we've worked over the course of several months with Chinese interlocutors demanding progress on cutting off support from precursors that are produced by Chinese companies and then shipped largely to Latin America. And then they make their way up into the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We're going to have to see how it's implemented," Campbell continued. "But so far, we believe the Chinese are going to take consequential steps that will essentially help us get a handle on really one of the most terrible drug epidemics the United States has ever faced. There's a back and forth on this. If they, in fact, make these arrests and shut down these companies, then we will be lifting a few sanctions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major concern to be addressed between Biden and Xi is the trend of increasingly common incidents between the Chinese and U.S. military. Government officials have reported that communications between China and U.S. military commands has become difficult, with Chinese military leaders refusing to meaningfully converse with their U.S. counterparts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We seek to establish responsible mechanisms that can deal with communications in a crisis to prevent escalation and inadvertence. And I believe that the Chinese will come around to see that some of this is also in their best interest as well," Campbell added.</span></p>

<p><strong>Teacher&rsquo;s Union That Encouraged Teacher Strikes Now Faces Its Own Employee Rebellion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Education Association (NEA) has a labor strike on its hands as its 48 employees protest low wages, Axios reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NEA, which represents 3 million educators, has encouraged several massive teacher strikes in past. Now, its own employees have voted unanimously to strike, claiming that wages have not risen to meet surging inflation in recent years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of NEA-affiliated Portland teachers went on strike in October over low pay and large class sizes, among other issues. The strike is ongoing. Teachers in Massachusetts and Columbus enjoyed NEA support while they went on strike last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The NEA is going to have step up and honor the values of the organization,&rdquo; the bargaining chair for the union representing the NEA&rsquo;s staff, LaToya Johnson, said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson said she hoped that the organization would give their employees the same benefits they fought for the teachers they represent to have.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;NEA has engaged in negotiations in good faith,&rdquo; an NEA spokesperson told Axios. &ldquo;[A]nd continues to apply a solutions-based approach to resolve the outstanding issues in a manner that addresses articulated priorities of AFSE while also balancing the strategic priorities of NEA and its members.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NEA, along with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to decide on when and how in-person education would be allows after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to emails obtained by Americans for Public Trust.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As &lsquo;The Marvels&rsquo; Bombs, Disney Doubles Down on Pushing LGBTQ Streaming Shows</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Walt Disney Company is rolling out more LGBTQ content as its latest superhero movie The Marvels crashed and burned at the box office on its opening weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Disney+ drama series Culprits focuses on a gay domestic relationship between two men played by Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and Kevin Vidal. The show focuses on Joe (Stewart-Jarrett), whose past criminal life threatens to re-emerge and disrupt the quiet suburban existence he has built with his male fianc&eacute; Jules (Vidal)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series &mdash; which is streaming on Disney+ in the U.K. and Hulu in the U.S. &mdash;&nbsp; also stars drag queen comedian Eddie Izzard, who now apparently goes by the name &ldquo;Suzy Eddie Izzard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Hulu is set to debut the new documentary We Live Here in the Midwest &mdash; a look at gay, transgender, and &ldquo;non-binary&rdquo; families that live in small towns and cities throughout America&rsquo;s heartland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the families profiled in the documentary are those with transgender parents. &ldquo;What my dad was feeling and why she felt like she did, was more than just her. There are more people out there who are like this,&rdquo; said one child whose father transitioned to become a &ldquo;woman.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another scene, a &ldquo;non-binary&rdquo; student discussed how she is treated in class.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The students believe that &lsquo;non-binary&rsquo; do not exist,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here right now so we do exist.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Live Here in the Midwest is set to debut on December 6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney has embraced LGBTQ messaging in its entertainment aimed at children and families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Breitbart News reported, Disney along with Netflix put out more LGBTQ content than any other studio in Hollywood in 2022, according to a GLAAD report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GLAAD said Disney released 59 films in 2022, and 24 of them were so-called &ldquo;LGBT inclusive films.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past two years, Disney has fought Florida over its anti-grooming Parental Rights in Education law, created multiple transgender characters for its children&rsquo;s shows, put gay characters at the center of its big-budget movies, and even launched an LGBTQ-themed apparel line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Disney eliminated 7,000 jobs worldwide as its profitability cratered. CEO Bob Iger is planning on slashing an additional $2 billion in spending in the months ahead.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Iran Expects $10 Billion Sanctions Waiver Gift from Biden</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iranian pro-regime propaganda site Tasnim News reported on Tuesday that the administration of President Joe Biden is likely to &ldquo;agree with Iran&rsquo;s getting access to $10 billion&rdquo; currently frozen under sanctions, adding to tens of billions in relief the White House has already processed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Biden administration may approve a sanctions waiver on Tuesday that will allow Iran to access at least $10 billion in previously frozen funds held in Iraq,&rdquo; the outlet declared. &ldquo;According to reports, Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Mohammad Reza Farzin held talks with his Omani counterpart last month on the acceleration of Iran&rsquo;s access to its financial resources.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasnim News made the claim based on a report published on Monday by the Washington Free Beacon that described the $10 billion in question as already under a sanctions waiver, but one set to expire on Tuesday. The initial sanctions relief was reportedly issued in July, months before the unprecedented massacre of 1,200 civilians in Israel by the Iran proxy terrorist group Hamas on October 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That mass killing &ndash; in which Hamas slaughtered children as young as infants, extensively tortured victims and desecrated corpses on camera, and took about 250 hostages &ndash; has increased pressure on the Biden administration to end sanctions relief programs that unfreeze money for Iran, allowing the government to use the unfrozen funds on legitimate needs and freeing up other funding to share with terrorist organizations such as Hamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the original report, the money represents payments made by the government of Iraq to Iran in exchange for electricity services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Trump administration first allowed Iraq to import electricity and gas from Iran, but only on the condition that the payments were kept in an escrow account in Baghdad,&rdquo; the Free Beacon explained. &ldquo;The Biden administration continued to issue that waiver, and then broadened it in July so that Iraq could move more than $10 billion outside the country, enabling Tehran to draw on the funds for its budget and humanitarian needs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iranian site Tasnim is sanctioned by the U.S. government for its close ties to the Iranian Islamist dictatorship. It was founded by members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization and a formal arm of the Iranian military, so it serves as an informal mouthpiece for the Iranian regime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The October 7 Hamas attack, which the terrorists branded the &ldquo;al-Aqsa flood,&rdquo; has renewed calls for the Biden administration to stop its policy of sanctions relief for Iran. Iran is the world&rsquo;s foremost state sponsor of terrorism and pours hundreds of millions of dollars a year into jihadist organizations threatening Israel. According to the U.S. State Department, Hamas itself receives about $100 million a year from the Iranian government. The Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah, based in Lebanon and vocally threatening attacks on Israel regularly, receives about $700 million a year from Iran.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the overwhelming evidence of coordination between Iran and groups such as Hamas, according to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), the Biden administration has granted Iran over $50 billion in sanctions relief. A month before the Israel attacks, Biden approved an agreement that gifted Iran $6 billion in sanctions relief in a single spell. In exchange for the $6 billion, which had been frozen in South Korean banks and which Washington allowed to be transferred to Iran-friendly Qatar, Iran freed five Americans it had been holding hostage in its political prisons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, shortly after the Hamas attack, the Biden administration &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; lifted all oil and gas sanctions on socialist Venezuela, in response to dictator Nicol&aacute;s Maduro&rsquo;s short-lived promise to allow a free and fair presidential election. Iran and Venezuela are close allies; Iran refines a significant percentage of its own crude in Venezuela and has helped Venezuela refurbish its dilapidated oil facilities. The two countries recently signed an agreement with the Syrian dictatorship to jointly build a new refining facility.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/nepal-bans-tiktok-disrupting-social-harmony"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/nepal-bans-tiktok-disrupting-social-harmony</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nepal bans TikTok for 'disrupting social harmony'</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepal&rsquo;s government decided to ban the popular social media app TikTok on Monday, saying it was disrupting "social harmony" in the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement was made following a Cabinet meeting. Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud said the app would be banned immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The government has decided to ban TikTok as it was necessary to regulate the use of the social media platform that was disrupting social harmony, goodwill and flow of indecent materials," Saud said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that to make social media platforms accountable, the government has asked the companies to register and open a liaison office in Nepal, pay taxes and abide by the country's laws and regulations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn't clear what triggered the ban or if TikTok had refused to comply with Nepal's requests. The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok, owned by China&rsquo;s ByteDance, has faced scrutiny in a number of countries because of concerns that Beijing could use the app to harvest user data or advance its interests. Countries including the United States, Britain and New Zealand have banned the app on government phones despite TikTok repeatedly denying that it has ever shared data with the Chinese government and would not do so if asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepal has banned all pornographic sites in 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/oregon-voters-want-to-walk-back-legalization-of-hard-drugs?utm_campaign=64487#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/oregon-voters-want-to-walk-back-legalization-of-hard-drugs?utm_campaign=64487#google_vignette</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oregon voters want to walk-back legalization of hard drugs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, voters in Oregon passed Measure 110, which decriminalized the possession of certain drugs in small quantities for personal use and shuffled revenue from cannabis taxes to resources aimed at helping addicts. Since it went into effect the following year, crime and substance use has not gone down as intended, and as a result, residents are calling for a reintroduction of criminal penalties for users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll conducted by DHM Research earlier this year revealed that more than 60 percent of Oregonians want to see the decriminalization aspect of Measure 110 repealed, though support for the use of cannabis taxes to fund treatment programs has maintained popularity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the poll, 51 percent of those surveyed said they believed Measure 110 has been bad for Oregon. Of those, 33 percent deemed it "very bad." Over 60 percent said drug addiction, homelessness, and crime had become worse in the time since it was adopted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural voters who identified as Republicans were more likely than their Democratic urban neighbors to believe that the policy has had a negative impact on the state, though a sizable proportion of every demographic said as much.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll, conducted via online survey among 500 Oregon voters between April 24 and 30, also found that drug addiction and mental health were viewed as more likely root causes of homelessness than access to affordable housing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Wall Street Journal reports, law enforcement officers across the state have found that contrary to what was expected, doing away with the threat of jail time has not resulted in more addicts seeking help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2021, while 6,000 tickets have been issued for drug possession, only 92 people have gotten in touch with the helpline to complete an assessment that would connect them with the necessary assistance. Those who fail to call are supposed to receive a $100 fine, however that is hardly ever enforced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overdoses have also continued to rise, jumping 23 percent between May 2021-2022 and May 2022-2023 to 1,500 statewide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Man arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson, police say</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson last month, South Yorkshire Police said in a statement on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson died after sustaining a cut to the neck while playing for the Nottingham Panthers against the Sheffield Steelers in England on October 28.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sheffield coroner&rsquo;s report found that the 29-year-old &ldquo;sustained an incised wound to the neck caused by the skate of another player&rdquo; and later died in hospital as a result of the injury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our investigation launched immediately following this tragedy and we have been carrying out extensive enquiries ever since to piece together the events which led to the loss of Adam in these unprecedented circumstances,&rdquo; detective chief superintendent Becs Horsfall said in a police statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have been speaking to highly specialised experts in their field to assist in our enquiries and continue to work closely with the health and safety department at Sheffield City Council, which is supporting our ongoing investigation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police statement added that the man arrested remains in custody.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Johnson&rsquo;s death, which the Panthers described in a statement on October 29 as a &ldquo;freak accident,&rdquo; there has been increased focus on player safety in ice hockey, particularly on whether protective neck guards should be more widely worn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s death has sent shockwaves through many communities, from our local residents here in Sheffield to ice hockey fans across the world,&rdquo; Horsfall said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in Hibbing, Minnesota, Johnson started his professional career in the American Hockey League before progressing to the National Hockey League (NHL).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He featured in 13 games over two years for the Pittsburgh Penguins and also played in Sweden and Germany before joining the Panthers for the 2023-24 season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an online obituary, Johnson&rsquo;s family remembered him as a &ldquo;thoughtful, patient and genuinely authentic&rdquo; person who &ldquo;took pleasure in the small, everyday things.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the ice hockey community across the world have paid tribute to the forward, including in the city of Nottingham, where fans have laid flowers outside the Motorpoint Arena.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said on Tuesday that officers are supporting Johnson&rsquo;s family while the investigation into his death remains ongoing.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Media in Panic Mode Over Questions About Whether They Knew in Advance About Hamas Attack on Israel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 7, four photojournalists who provide reporting and photos for the likes of the Associated Press (AP), CNN, the New York Times, Reuters, and other outlets were allegedly at the Israeli border with Hamas terrorists who committed acts of atrocities against innocent Israeli civilians that shocked the world. Since an Israel-supporting news watchdog website reported the claim, everyone wants to know if these Gaza-based reporters knew in advance about the attack and, more importantly, if they could have saved lives by alerting the world about it. The question arises: Did the AP, CNN, the New York Times, and Reuters know about the Hamas terror attack in advance?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegations have sent major media into panic mode and generated even more mistrust in the corporate press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website HonestReporting, which chronicles coverage of Israel by an increasingly one-sided press to contrast the "Pallywood" and crisis actor coverage by Hamas and its agents, asks: "Is it conceivable to assume that 'journalists' just happened to appear early in the morning at the border without prior coordination with the terrorists? Or were they part of the plan?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamas terrorists paraglided and drove into the civilian populations that day and committed acts of horrific brutality. They wanted their murders and acts of terror chronicled for the world, which is why they wore GoPro cameras and apparently arranged for these traditional media photographers to go in with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HonestReporting reported that "four names appear on AP&rsquo;s photo credits from the Israel-Gaza border area on October 7: Hassan Eslaiah, Yousef Masoud, Ali Mahmud, and Hatem Ali." The news watchdog took a close look at Elsaiah, a "freelancer who also works for CNN, crossed into Israel, took photos of a burning Israeli tank, and then captured infiltrators entering Kibbutz Kfar Azza."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsaiah "did not wear a press vest or a helmet," the website reported. He posted a video of himself on Twitter/X saying that &ldquo;everyone who were inside this tank were kidnapped, everyone who were inside the tank were kidnapped a short while ago by al-Qassam Brigades [Hamas&rsquo; armed wing], as we have seen with our own eyes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website later featured an older photo of Elsaiah with the Hamas leader who planned the attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In war reporting, journalists are often given a heads-up and allowed to chronicle American troops heading into battle, for example. But this wasn't an act of war -- it was terror. It was murder for murder's sake. There hadn't been an Israeli offensive to which the Gaza terror organization was responding. Indeed, if Hamas had been wearing uniforms and acting as an "army" they would be accused of war crimes. As it is, they're accused of crimes against humanity.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UK infant Indi Gregory dies amid legal battle with British government over treatment options</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A terminally ill baby in the United Kingdom, who was the focus of a legal battle involving her parents, British health officials and the Italian government over treatment options, died Monday morning in hospice care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Concern, a group supporting the family, said 8-month-old Indi Gregory died after her life support was withdrawn on Sunday, according to The Associated Press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infant had suffered brain damage because of a rare condition known as mitochondrial disease.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The child's doctors said her life support should be removed to allow her to die at a hospital or in hospice, but her parents, Dean Gregory and Claire Staniforth, continued to fight for her to remain on life support, hoping that experimental treatments may extend her life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Italian government had solicited permission for her to be treated at Bambino Gesu Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Rome. Italian officials even granted citizenship to the baby amid the legal battle over her health care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors claimed that Indi was not aware of her surroundings and was suffering as they argued she should be allowed to die peacefully. Legal challenges supported by Christian Concern were rejected by British judges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indi's case is the latest in a series of legal battles in the United Kingdom between parents and doctors over treatment for children with terminal illnesses. British judges have repeatedly taken the side of doctors in cases about the best interests of the child, despite parental objections to a proposed treatment option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court of Appeal Justice Peter Jackson said on Friday that doctors treating Gregory and other critically ill children were put in an "extremely challenging" position by the legal battle. He also criticized "manipulative litigation tactics" that attempt to frustrate orders made by judges after careful consideration.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Over 70% of Americans Unwilling to Be Drafted If WW3 Breaks Out, Poll</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new poll has found that 72 percent of Americans would be unwilling to volunteer to serve their country if WW3 breaks out, compared to just 21 percent who said they would.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the US becomes deeply embedded in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war, the Echelon Insights findings suggest most Americans hold a more &lsquo;America First&rsquo; view of foreign policy than the political establishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1987, the US military has shrunk by 39 percent, and the Army and Air Force missed their recruitment targets in 2023 by 10,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Navy missed its target by 6,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of troops could pose a big problem for America&rsquo;s war readiness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While infantry soldiers are relatively easy to train in a crisis, pilots and naval specialists require years of instruction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The National Pulse noted, the traditionally conservative-leaning young people the military has often relied on for manpower may also have been deterred by its intolerant attitude towards unvaccinated Americans in recent years and senior officers&rsquo; promotion of far-left interests such as drag and &ldquo;white rage.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, with the prospect of WW3 is becoming more likely, Americans may not have to worry about being drafted as nuclear weapons would destroy most countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, President Donald Trump warned that Mexico could be at risk of nuclear destruction in the Event of WW3 breaking out from the war in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said the potential ramifications of another nuclear war could involve the total destruction of Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The biggest threat is nuclear weapons,&rdquo; Trump said.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/12/former-national-champion-texas-head-coach-jimbo-fischer-fired-poor-performance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/12/former-national-champion-texas-head-coach-jimbo-fischer-fired-poor-performance/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Former National Champion Head Coach Jimbo Fischer Fired For Poor Performance</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas A&amp;M has fired head football coach Jimbo Fischer, bringing his six-year tenure with the Aggies to a close while netting himself $76 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firing comes on the heels of a 51-10 victory of Mississippi State, moving Texas A&amp;M to 6-4 on the season, according to CBS Sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher took the Texas A&amp;M head coaching position in 2018, coming off a successful tenure at Florida State, where he won a national championship in 2014, per the outlet. While the Aggies did manage to go 9-4 in 2018, Texas A&amp;M has struggled over the past two seasons, barely cracking eight wins in 2021 and going 5-7 in 2022, per the outlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Fischer became head coach of the Aggies, he signed a 10-year, $75-million contract, which was later extended through 2031. The contract also came with a massive buyout clause worth $76 million, which he is now owed by Texas A&amp;M, per the outlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;After very careful analysis of all the components related to Texas A&amp;M football, I recommended to President Welsh and then Chancellor Sharp that a change in the leadership of the program was necessary in order for Aggie football to reach our full potential and they accepted my decision. We appreciate Coach Fisher&rsquo;s time here at Texas A&amp;M and we wish him the best in his future endeavors,&rdquo; Texas A&amp;M athletics director Ross Bjork said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aggies will finish off their regular season with Abilene Christian University and top-25 LSU.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bloomberg: U.S. Debt Interest Bill Soars Past $1 Trillion a Year</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of high levels of debt and higher interest rates has pushed the annualized interest cost of government debt past $1 trillion, an analysis from Bloomberg showed Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This amounts to a doubling of interest costs over the past 19 months, according to Bloomberg. It is the equivalent of 15.9 percent of the Federal budget for fiscal year 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The worsening metrics may reignite debate about the US fiscal path amid heavy borrowing from Washington. That dynamic has already helped drive up bond yields, threatened the return of the so-called bond vigilantes and led Fitch Ratings to downgrade US government debt in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There will be further increases to Treasury coupon auctions and T-bills outstanding going forward,&rdquo; Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Ira Jersey and Will Hoffman wrote in a research note. &ldquo;Besides deficits of over $2 trillion in the foreseeable future, climbing maturities following the increase of issuance from March 2020 will also need to be refinanced.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cumulative deficit for the 2024&ndash;2033 period will total $20.2 trillion, or 6.1 percent of GDP. Deficits are expected to be at least 5.5 percent of GDP every year for the coming decade. Since 1973, the federal government budget deficit has averaged 3.6 percent of GDP.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Time&rsquo;: CNN&rsquo;s Van Jones Says Biden Needs To Consider Retiring</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN&rsquo;s Van Jones said Tuesday that President Joe Biden needs to consider retiring following a poll from The New York Times/Siena College.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sunday poll found president Donald Trump leading Biden by a substantial margin in five out of six key swing states. Biden holds a slight edge within the margin of error over Trump in Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones argued Biden is in a tough position. </span><strong>Video Plays</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several pundits have questioned whether Biden should drop out of the race, with CNN&rsquo;s David Axelrod saying the president needs to decide whether staying in the race is &ldquo;in his best interest or the country&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of Defending Democracy Together Bill Kristol posted on X that Biden needs to make an act of &ldquo;personal sacrifice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time. President Biden has served our country well. I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll do so for the next year. But it&rsquo;s time for an act of personal sacrifice and public spirit. It&rsquo;s time to pass the torch to the next generation. It&rsquo;s time for Biden to announce he won&rsquo;t run in 2024,&rdquo; Kristol wrote.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future Darwin Award Winner Tried to Target Jewish Children in America's Midwest</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman in Indiana plowed her car into a building she thought was a Jewish school. The police describe her as a terrorist and she was arrested at the scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only was her intention to hurt or kill Jewish school children in their school in Indianapolis but she was completely mistaken about her target. The 34-year-old terrorist woman, allegedly backed her vehicle into a building associated with Black Hebrew Israelites on Friday. She admitted to the police that she specifically targeted the building because she was offended by a Hebrew Israelite symbol in front. This psycho thought she was entitled to try to harm children because she was offended by a symbol in front of the building, apparently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were several adults and children in the building at the time. However, they were not who the woman thought they were. She said, &ldquo;Yes. I did it on purpose.&rdquo; She kept describing the building as the &ldquo;Israel school&rdquo; and she spoke about &ldquo;her people back in Palestine.&rdquo; According to the Anti-Defamation League, the Israelite School of Universal and Practical Knowledge is a sect of the Black Hebrew Israelites. It is an extremist group that is anti-Israel. The Southern Poverty Law Center (I know) has designated them as a hate group. So, ironically, the unhinged and offended the woman plowed into the building used by a group who hate Israel as she does.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is Darwin Award material. An investigation is underway. There may be additional charges brought against her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis said Safe Indiana, a Jewish community security program, is working with cops to probe the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Safety and security for our community is of the utmost importance, and we are more secure and prepared than ever before,&rdquo; the federation said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Although a Jewish facility was not targeted, solely due to ironic misidentification, this is yet another reminder to maintain security protocols, remain vigilant of suspicious activity and to (report promptly) to the appropriate authorities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These random acts of terror seem to be increasing. FBI Director Christopher Wray recently warned of lone wolf attacks. Wray said Hamas inspired terrorists pose a threat not seen since the days of ISIS. She confessed that she was motivated to do the attack after watching news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. She is originally from Amman, Jordan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wray said that while Hamas is assessed to have no capabilities inside the US, other actors &ndash; possible radicalized individuals or small groups &ndash; could take inspiration from the terror group in a way similar to ISIS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to the Senate&rsquo;s Homeland Security Committee, he said: &ldquo;We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration, the likes of which we haven&rsquo;t seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said: &ldquo;Here in the United States, our most immediate concern is that violent extremists &ndash; individuals or small groups &ndash; will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was charged with a preliminary charge of criminal recklessness. Her first court appearance is scheduled for today, November 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255928/vatican-hospital-offers-to-treat-critically-ill-baby-denied-life-support-in-britain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255928/vatican-hospital-offers-to-treat-critically-ill-baby-denied-life-support-in-britain</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vatican hospital offers to treat critically ill baby denied life support in Britain</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vatican&rsquo;s pediatric hospital has offered to treat 8-month-old baby Indi Gregory after a British court ruled that she be removed from life support against her parents&rsquo; wishes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregory, who was born in February, suffers from a rare degenerative mitochondrial disease and has been receiving life-sustaining treatment on a ventilator at the Queen&rsquo;s Medical Centre in Nottingham, England.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After England&rsquo;s high court ruled that it was in the child&rsquo;s &ldquo;best interests&rdquo; to be taken off life support, Gregory&rsquo;s parents appealed to take her to Rome for treatment, an appeal that was denied by a British judge over the weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Italian government decided in an emergency meeting on Monday to grant the critically ill child Italian citizenship and to cover the cost of her medical treatment at the Vatican&rsquo;s Bambino Ges&ugrave; (jay-zoo) hospital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;They say there isn&rsquo;t much hope for little Indi, but until the very end, I&rsquo;ll do what I can to defend her life,&rdquo; Italian President Giorgia Meloni wrote on social media on Nov. 6. &ldquo;And to defend the right of her mamma and papa to do all that they can for her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bambino Ges&ugrave; hospital has previously offered medical treatment to other critically ill children, including Alfie Evans in 2018 and Charlie Gard in 2017, both of whom were ultimately denied the chance to travel to Italy by U.K. courts and died days after being removed from life support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Concern has published a letter from the president of the Bambino Ges&ugrave; hospital outlining &ldquo;a detailed treatment plan&rdquo; for the child, which includes &ldquo;life-sustaining treatment and palliative care to ensure Indi&rsquo;s survival and comfort while the treatments take effect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Williams, chief executive of Christian Concern and the Christian Legal Centre supporting the Gregorys&rsquo; case, has noted that this is believed to be the first time that a parent&rsquo;s appeal against an order to withdraw life-sustaining treatment has been rejected by the Court of Appeal without a hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The law is there to protect life and the most vulnerable in our society. What is happening in this case sets a very worrying precedent with regard to that principle,&rdquo; Williams said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is very concerning that a child can be held against the parents&rsquo; wishes when they have alternative treatment available.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the newly granted Italian citizenship, the child&rsquo;s parents, Dean Gregory and Claire Staniforth, can appeal to the Italian consulate in Britain to request that their daughter be airlifted to Italy for treatment, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone Pillon (pee-lone), an Italian lawyer assisting the Gregory family, wrote on Nov. 7: &ldquo;We are working to find an agreement between the two countries to satisfy the family&rsquo;s request and treat Indi in Rome.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the Italian government&rsquo;s decision, Dean Gregory, Indi&rsquo;s father, said: &ldquo;My heart fills up with joy that the Italians have given Claire and I hope and faith back in humanity. The Italians have shown us care and loving support and I wish the U.K. authorities were the same.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Marching Band turns into Marching Hands?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Southern band member punches heckler in the stands, continues playing -&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&rsquo;t miss a beat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Texas Southern University tuba player swiftly knocked out an obnoxious heckler during a football game Saturday before carrying on playing his instrument.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video taken from the stands during Saturday&rsquo;s game between Texas Southern and Jackson State shows the college band&rsquo;s tuba player bouncing along to the music while a fan starts yelling at him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Jackson State fan can be seen in the footage aggressively yelling at the tuba player, who is attempting to continue playing with the band.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeming to have had enough of the outburst, the Texas Southern tuba player says something to the man before swiftly punching him four times in the face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Texas Southern band member then returns to his instrument as if the altercation never happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one recording of the incident, the band member can be heard telling the aggressive fan, &ldquo;F&ndash;k off, b&mdash;h.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unclear whether the heckler, who stumbled back several feet in the stands, sustained any injuries from the scuffle. It&rsquo;s also unclear whether police responded to the incident or if any action was taken against the band member.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Southern University ended up losing to Jackson State, 21-19.</span></p>

<p><strong>FIELD HOCKEY CAPTAIN SLAMS MASSACHUSETTS LAW ALLOWING BOYS ON GIRLS TEAMS AFTER BRUTAL INJURY TO HER TEAMMATE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men competing against women in sports spawned another tragic story on Thursday when a female field hockey player suffered significant injuries to her face after taking a shot from a male opponent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The female high schooler played on Dighton-Rehoboth High School&rsquo;s team, and now the co-captain / teammate of her squad is speaking up and calling for policy change to prohibit men from competing against women to avoid further incidents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelsey Bain, who plays on Dighton-Rehoboth and is the co-captain of the field hockey team, posted a letter on X, directed at the MIAA to change the association&rsquo;s policy that allows men to compete against women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is a letter I sent to the MIAA in response to the recent Swampscott vs. Dighton-Rehoboth field hockey incident,&rdquo; Kelsey Bain posted on X, including the three-page notice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women&rsquo;s rights activist and OutKick host Riley Gaines shared Bain&rsquo;s statement on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man played for Swampscott High School, who played Dighton-Rehoboth in a playoff field hockey contest on Thursday. Under the MIAA&rsquo;s ruling &mdash; the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association &mdash; men can compete against women if a sport does not offer their gender&rsquo;s league.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man&rsquo;s shot knocked several of the girl&rsquo;s teeth out and caused serious facial injuries. Video of the hit shows the girl writhing in pain and screaming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent these incidents from continuing, Kelsey Bain is stepping into the discourse, understanding that the association will not budge on the issue unless they are challenged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dighton-Rehoboth Superintendent Bill Runey put out a statement, identifying that the opponent was indeed a man and relaying the horror of the team personnel after one of their own suffered a brutal injury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Runey said,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Last night, a female field hockey player for the Dighton-Rehoboth Regional High School girls&rsquo; field hockey team sustained significant facial and dental injuries when she was struck in the face by a shot in the third quarter versus Swampscott in an MIAA state playoff contest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The shot was taken by a male member of the Swampscott girls field hockey team. This injury required hospitalization. The player, her family, teammates, and coaches remain in my prayers.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>
