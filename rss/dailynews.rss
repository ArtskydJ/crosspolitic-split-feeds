<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/here-is-when-trump-has-to-surrender-in-georgia-case-5466434?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/here-is-when-trump-has-to-surrender-in-georgia-case-5466434?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trump Ordered to Surrender by August 25 in Georgia Case, Will Have Mugshot Taken</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis gave President Donald Trump and the 18 other defendants who were charged Monday until noon on Aug. 25 to surrender.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ms. Willis announced the surrender date in a press conference on Monday evening after a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury handed down charges against the President. Meanwhile, the district attorney said that a trial would likely take place within the next six months, which would occur in the midst of GOP primary elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Trump and the other Defendants charged in this Indictment refused to accept that Trump lost, and they knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump. That conspiracy contained a common plan and purpose to commit two or more acts of racketeering activity in Fulton County, Georgia, elsewhere in the State of Georgia, and in other states," the indictment says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under the indictment, President Trump and the other defendants are each charged with one count of violating Georgia&rsquo;s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and allegedly engaged in &ldquo;criminal enterprise in Fulton County, Georgia&mdash;and elsewhere&mdash;to accomplish the illegal goal&rdquo; of keeping the President in office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The 18 other individuals listed in the indictment include Rudy Guiliani, John Eastman, Mark Meadows, Kenneth Chesebro, Jeffrey Clark, Jenna Ellis, Ray Stallings Smith III, Robert Cheeley, Michael Roman, David Shafer, Shawn Micah Tresher Still, Stephen Cliffgard Lee, Harrison William Prescott Floyd, Trvian C. Kutti, Sidney Powell, Cathy Latham, Scott Hall, and Misty Hampton.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ms. Willis, in the conference, claimed that the charges against President Trump and the others were not politically motivated. &ldquo;I make decisions in this office based on the facts in the law,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The law is completely nonpartisan. That&rsquo;s how decisions are made in every case to date.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, a statement from the Trump campaign said otherwise, accusing the district attorney of having a partisan animus against him. That statement, meanwhile, accused Ms. Willis of engaging in election interference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It's the fourth time the President has been indicted this year. He's the first President in American history to be indicted on criminal charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He faces a New York state trial in March 2024 involving a hush money payment, and a federal trial beginning in May in Florida for allegedly mishandling federal classified documents. In both cases, Trump pleaded not guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A third indictment, in Washington federal court, accuses him of illegally seeking to overturn his 2020 election defeat. President Trump denies wrongdoing in this case as well, and a trial date has yet to be set.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">So what&rsquo;s next?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After defendants in Georgia are indicted by a grand jury, they are arraigned, which is the formal reading in court of the charges. Defendants are also asked to enter a plea. President Trump's attorney could ask the court to waive the arraignment, and he could enter a plea of not guilty without appearing in court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bail also will be determined. He likely will be released, probably in exchange for a promise to return to face the charges at trial. The President will have his mugshot taken upon being taken into custody, Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat told local media this month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He may try to move it to another part of the state, arguing the jury pool in Fulton County, which President Joe Biden won with about 73 percent of the vote, would be biased against him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The process of selecting a jury could be lengthy, given the passionate views many people have of the President and the amount of time jurors would have to dedicate to the trial. In the ongoing trial in Atlanta of rapper Young Thug, or Jeffery Lamar Williams, jury selection ran for months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Checking back in on Hawaii now&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/maui-residents-claim-people-being-looted-robbed-at-gunpoint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/maui-residents-claim-people-being-looted-robbed-at-gunpoint/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>&lsquo;Utter chaos&rsquo;: Maui residents say they are being looted, &lsquo;robbed at gunpoint&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Some Maui residents say they have been looted and robbed at gunpoint while catastrophic wildfires rage on the island &mdash; leaving them begging for a greater response from authorities as thieves make off with vital supplies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As rescue crews work to deliver necessities such as water, food, and first aid to those in need, locals say some residents have grown so desperate waiting for help that they&rsquo;ve resorted to stealing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">West Maui residents blame the robberies in Lahaina on the fact that they feel abandoned without supplies or answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Jeremy Aganos, who owns the restaurant Coconut Caboose &mdash; one of the few buildings that survived the fires on Front Street in Lahaina &mdash; told KITV it was &ldquo;utter chaos&rdquo; for people trying to find food, water and shelter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An Oregon resident told the outlet that their relative flew into Maui to donate water, food, household items and clothing &mdash; only to be robbed at gunpoint soon after his arrival.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The startling uptick in crime has left residents slamming local leadership for its inaction in the wake of the catastrophic fires, which have become the deadliest in the US in more than a century as nearly 100 people have been reported dead so far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some police presence. There&rsquo;s some small military presence. But at night, people are being robbed at gunpoint,&rdquo; Matt Robb, co-owner of a bar in Lahaina called the Dirty Monkey, told Insider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A mobile refrigerated morgue was rushed to Lahaina on Monday to keep bodies cool as the death toll on Maui hit 96 &mdash; and is only expected to rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Two fires have not yet been completely contained, including the one that reduced Lahaina&rsquo;s neighborhoods to heaps of ash and debris, according to an update from Maui County.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Only 3% of Lahaina &mdash; previously a town of 13,000 &mdash; had been searched.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Maui Police Chief John Pelletier said the fire had been so significant that each recovered body will have to be identified through DNA testing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hawaii officials are urging tourists to avoid traveling to Maui as many hotels are prepared to house evacuees and first responders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/hawaii-governor-says-state-is-looking-to-acquire-land-that-was-destroyed-in-fires?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/hawaii-governor-says-state-is-looking-to-acquire-land-that-was-destroyed-in-fires?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hawaii governor says state is looking to 'acquire land' that was destroyed in fires</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Monday, Hawaiian governor Josh Green announced that his administration was considering acquiring properties in the seaside resort town of Lahaina that had been destroyed by the recent wildfires.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He vowed to prevent foreign buyers from swooping in to exploit the tragedy, suggesting the state was better suited to take control of the land.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I'm already thinking of ways for the state to acquire that land so that we can put it into workforce housing, to put it back into families, or make it open spaces in perpetuity as a memorial to the people who were lost," Green said while standing amongst the rubble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a separate press conference, Green reiterated his committment to ensure the land was protected for residents, and revealed that he had spoken with the Hawaiian attorney general regarding "options to do a moratorium on any sales of properties that have been damaged or destroyed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the Honolulu Civil Beat, over 2,000 structures were destroyed in the fire, three quarters of which were residential.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">From Hawaii to Chicago we go&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2023/08/14/chicago-group-asks-gang-members-not-shoot-people-between-9-00-a-m-9-00-p-m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2023/08/14/chicago-group-asks-gang-members-not-shoot-people-between-9-00-a-m-9-00-p-m/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Chicago Group Asks Gang Members Not to Shoot People Between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Native Sons, a group from Chicago&rsquo;s Rogers Park neighborhood, is asking that gang members pledge to cease fire from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily so no one lives in fear of being shot while going about their day-to-day activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The push for the cease-fire is being called &ldquo;The People&rsquo;s Ordinance,&rdquo; CWBChicago reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Native Sons&rsquo; co-founder, Tatiana Atkins, said:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under this ordinance, we ask that people stop associating with and glorifying &lsquo;shooters,&rsquo; stop glorifying &lsquo;switches,&rsquo; and stop wearing those ski masks everywhere which perpetuates you as some &lsquo;opp.&rsquo; When those who live a certain lifestyle try to hang with &lsquo;regular&rsquo; class citizens, they put everyone at risk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At the end of the day, five-year-olds are being killed by gun violence, 14-year-olds are being killed by gun violence, 78-year-olds are being killed by gun violence, pregnant women are being killed by gun violence, young boys with bright futures are being killed by gun violence, fathers are being killed by gun violence, and this shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Atkins hopes that gang members will adopt the cease-fire and that parents will react by making sure they have their children home and inside as 9:00 p.m. approaches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Breitbart News reported at least 23 people were shot over the weekend in Chicago, three of them fatally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Over 370 people have been killed in Chicago thus far in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now in entertainment news&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Sound of Freedom director teases sequel focusing on Haiti</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During a recent interview with Variety, the writer and director of widely acclaimed independent film Sound of Freedom revealed that a sequel might be in the works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Alejandro Monteverde told the magazine that he has been in discussions about writing a sequel to the smash hit film, which would be focused on child sex trafficking in Haiti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"There's definitely a lot of interest to exploring [the subject] a little deeper, because this is just the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot of interest to kind of explore Haiti, what's happening in Haiti. There's [sequel] talks focusing on Haiti," Monteverde said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Sound of Freedom became the highest-grossing independent film since 2019 following its initial release in July, earning more than $173 million. The film tells the story of a former government agent, Tim Ballard, who started an organization to fight child sex trafficking in Colombia. It stars Jim Caviezel, who plays Ballard as he embarks on a mission to rescue children who have arguably been subjected to the worst of crimes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The film has been dismissed by mainstream media and other left-wing critics as a "conspiracy," however; the Sound of Freedom is based on a true story about Ballard's organization, Operation Underground Railroad, and a real mission where his team saved 55 children and 123 people in total.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Monteverde dispelled misconceptions about the film to Variety and criticized mainstream media for avoiding the film, suspecting that they have done so on purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The origin [of the film] has been avoided, purposely or accidentally, in the media,&rdquo; Monteverde said. &ldquo;The origin will answer a lot of these misconceptions on the film.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The film writer explained that he got the idea for the movie after watching a news segment about child sex trafficking, saying that what he learned "shook my soul because I didn't really believe it [existed]."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I just, in my head, could not put those two pieces together &mdash; an adult and a child," he told Variety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Feeling the need to take action against this atrocity, Monteverde began to write a fictional screenplay called "The Mogul." When the film's producer, Eduardo, had met Tim Ballard, the two decided to change the direction of the film and base it on the true story of Ballard's time working as a former special agent for the Department of Homeland Security, in which he has deployed as an undercover operative for the US Child Sex Tourism Jump Team, Variety reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Monteverde told the reporter that the film had been finished years before QAnon conspiracy theorists sprung into the spotlight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"All I wanted was to present a question about the problem: human trafficking, child trafficking, child sexual exploitation. How bad the problem is. We shot in 2018. In 2019, it was a completely finished film [before QAnon became a phenomenon]," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The director said the negative press surrounding the film was "heartbreaking."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On why the sequel would be focused on Haiti, Monteverde said, "Haiti was a big part of Tim's work. I was very tempted to do Haiti on this film. But I wanted to do an origin story, and it was too much material. I needed to end where I ended."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/native-americans-calls-for-commanders-name-change-to-redskins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/native-americans-calls-for-commanders-name-change-to-redskins/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Native American group demands Commanders reinstate &lsquo;Redskins&rsquo; name</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The name of the football team playing in Washington D.C. is once again under question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A group called the Native American Guardian&rsquo;s Association (NAGA) is demanding the Washington Commanders change their name back to the Redskins, organizing support for the name reversal with a petition that has gained more than 90,000 signatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We invite all Americans to stand up for the dignity of EVERY AMERICAN under assault in today&rsquo;s increasingly nonsensical culture wars,&rdquo; the petition says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This &lsquo;LINE IN THE SAND&rsquo; moment reinforces undeniable history of the NATIVE AMERICAN assisting the FOUNDING OF AMERICA, with NATIVE AMERICAN principles used by the FOUNDING FATHERS in the US Constitution &ndash; and, EVERY AMERICAN&rsquo;s right to the 1st and 14th Amendment and not to be targets of cancel culture or ESG.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This is not a simple left or right issue for Americans; it reaches across the political spectrum dating back to our Founding Fathers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The letter was addressed to the Commanders&rsquo; leadership group, including new owners Josh Harris and Magic Johnson as well as head coach Ron Rivera.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;As the NFL franchise representing the nation&rsquo;s capital, you have a distinct opportunity to recognize the history and value of the American Indian,&rdquo; the letter continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">NAGA, which is led by a board of Native Americans, is a &ldquo;non-profit organization advocating for increased education about Native Americans, especially in public educational institutions, and greater recognition of Native American Heritage through the high profile venues of sports and other public platforms,&rdquo; according to its website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Disgraced former team owner Dan Snyder changed the organization&rsquo;s name in 2020 after years of pressure, beginning the 2020 and 2021 seasons with the name &ldquo;Washington Football Team&rdquo; before opting for the Commanders moniker prior to the 2022 season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to ESPN, the team could be looking to change its name again following its sale to the ownership group led by Harris, largely in an effort to distance themselves from Synder&rsquo;s disastrous tenure.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start today&rsquo;s newsbrief by heading to Hawaii.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-did-hawaii-wildfires-start-what-know-about-maui-big-island-blazes-2023-08-11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-did-hawaii-wildfires-start-what-know-about-maui-big-island-blazes-2023-08-11/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wildfires on Hawaii's Maui have killed at least 96 people, forced tens of thousands of residents and tourists to evacuate the island and devastated the historic resort city of luh-hai-nuh. It's the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. The Big Island of Hawaii is also battling wildfires, which have caused no fatalities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firefighting crews were still battling flare-ups. The largest fire in Lahaina is 85% contained and has burned 2,170 acres (880 hectares), Maui County said. Another fire in upcountry/Kula is 60% contained and has charred 678 acres (270 hectares). Smaller fires elsewhere are now 100% contained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fires, which started the night of Aug. 8, wreaked widespread destruction in Lahaina. The city of about 13,000 people on northwestern Maui was once a whaling center and the Hawaiian Kingdom's capital, and now draws 2 million tourists a year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cadaver dogs searched Lahaina's charred ruins for victims, and officials said it was likely the number of dead would rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates it will cost $5.5 billion to rebuild the town.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Maui blaze is the deadliest U.S. wildfire since 1918, when northern Minnesota's Cloquet Fire, which raged for more than four days, claimed 453 lives, according to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). The deadliest wildfire in U.S history, Wisconsin's Peshtigo fire in 1871, killed 1,152.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii's fires also constitute the most lethal disaster to hit the islands since a tsunami that killed 61 people in 1960, a year after Hawaii became a U.S. state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Maui residents have questioned whether more could have been done to warn them. Witnesses said they had little warning, describing their terror as the blaze destroyed Lahaina in what seemed like minutes. Some people dove into the Pacific Ocean to escape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sirens stationed around the island - intended to warn of impending natural disasters - never sounded, and widespread power and cellular outages hampered other forms of alerting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii Governor Josh Green vowed on Sunday to investigate the response and emergency notification systems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The causes of the fires have not yet been determined. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for the Hawaiian Islands for high winds and dry weather - conditions ripe for wildfires.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 85% of U.S. wildfires are caused by humans, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Natural causes include lightning and volcanic activity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Hawaii, less than 1% of fires are due to natural causes, according to Elizabeth Pickett, co-executive director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization. The Hawaiian Islands have six active volcanoes, including one on Maui.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spread of flammable non-native grasses in areas of former farmland and forest has created large amounts of small, easily ignited materials that increase the risk and severity of fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record-setting heat this summer has contributed to unusually severe wildfires in Europe and western Canada. Scientists say climate change, driven by fossil fuel use, has led to more frequent and more powerful extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was Biden&rsquo;s response to all this?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/biden-slammed-for-no-comment-response-to-maui-wildfire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/biden-slammed-for-no-comment-response-to-maui-wildfire/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden slammed for silence on Maui wildfire catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden had yet to offer a verbal statement Monday evening in response to the mounting death toll in the catastrophic Maui wildfire &mdash; the deadliest US blaze in more than a century &mdash; after spending the weekend sunning himself on the beach near his Delaware vacation home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 80-year-old commander-in-chief avoided reporters upon his return to Washington Monday morning, walking directly across the White House lawn to the Oval Office without approaching the press to give a statement on the tragedy, as US leaders often do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House later put out a statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, taking note of the carnage in Maui and detailing government resources on offer to beleaguered residents.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As residents of Hawai&rsquo;i mourn the loss of life and devastation taking place across their beautiful home, we mourn with them. Like I&rsquo;ve said, not only our prayers are with those impacted &ndash; but every asset we have will be available to them,&rdquo; read the statement attributed to Biden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day earlier, the president offered a stony-hearted &ldquo;No comment&rdquo; when asked about the death toll, which has climbed to at least 96. During a bike ride Sunday morning, Biden gave a similar unfeeling answer when asked about the tragedy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at it,&rdquo; he said when asked if he planned to visit the Aloha State.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden is currently scheduled to visit Wisconsin Tuesday and travel to Camp David Thursday to meet with the leaders of South Korea and Japan the following day. He is then due to travel to Lake Tahoe, Nev. and remain there until Aug. 24.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg reporter Justin Sink posted a photo of Biden lounging with a group of people on Rehoboth Beach Sunday afternoon, triggering outrage on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I campaigned for you,&rdquo; raged former Hawaii legislator Kaniela Ing early Monday. &ldquo;Now, when I lose dozens of my friends, family, and neighbors. This?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear from the president on this,&rdquo; Jean-Pierre promised. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything to announce at this time, but certainly, he&rsquo;s the president and you&rsquo;re going to hear from him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2023/08/13/exclusive-40k-migrants-apprehended-along-southwest-border-in-first-10-days-of-august/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/border/2023/08/13/exclusive-40k-migrants-apprehended-along-southwest-border-in-first-10-days-of-august/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>40K Migrants Apprehended Along Southwest Border in First 10 Days of August</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 40,000 migrants along the southwest border during the first ten days of August. The Tucson and Rio Grande Valley Sectors reported more than 10,000 each.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unofficial reports obtained from law enforcement by Breitbart Texas reveal that during the first ten days of August, Border Patrol agents apprehended 39,324 migrants who illegally crossed the border between ports of entry. This is an average of 5,708 apprehensions per day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tucson and Rio Grande Valley Sectors reported 10,867 and 10,465 migrant apprehensions, respectively. The five Texas-based border sectors accounted for 23,119 of the 39,324 migrant apprehensions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a sharp drop in June, migrant apprehensions reportedly spiked again in July with the arrest of more than 130,000 migrants, the Washington Post reported. If the current apprehension rate in August continues, U.S. Customs and Border Protection could report the apprehension of nearly 177,000 migrants in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uganda president defiant after World Bank funding suspended over LGBT law</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uganda&rsquo;s President Yoweri Museveni on Thursday denounced the World Bank&rsquo;s decision to suspend new funding in response to a harsh anti-LGBTQ law and vowed to find alternative sources of credit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Bank said on Tuesday that the law, which imposes the death penalty for certain same-sex acts, contradicted its values and that it would pause new funding until it could test measures to prevent discrimination in projects it finances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Bank has an existing portfolio of $5.2 billion in Uganda, although these projects will not be affected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anti-LGBTQ law, enacted in May, has drawn widespread denunciation from local and international rights organisations and Western governments, though it is popular domestically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Museveni said in a statement that Uganda was trying to reduce its borrowing in any case and would not give in to pressure from foreign institutions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is, therefore, unfortunate that the World Bank and other actors dare to want to coerce us into abandoning our faith, culture, principles and sovereignty, using money. They really underestimate all Africans,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Museveni said that if Uganda needed to borrow, it could do so from other sources, and that oil production expected to start by 2025 would provide additional revenues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added he hoped the World Bank would reconsider its decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the United States imposed visa restrictions on some Ugandan officials in response to the law. President Joe Biden also ordered a review of U.S. aid to Uganda.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FBI shoots and kills Utah man wanted for threats against Biden, New York prosecutor</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI shot and killed a Utah man on Wednesday while trying to arrest him for threatening to murder President Joe Biden and the New York district attorney who is prosecuting President Donald Trump in connection with hush money payments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many other politicians were also allegedly threatened in social media posts by the man, Provo resident Craig Deleeuw Robertson, who was accused in court documents of vowing to retaliate against the FBI during an investigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court documents say the FBI described Robertson as a white man &ldquo;approximately 70-75 years old&rdquo; who was surveilled &ldquo;wearing a dark suit (later observed as having an AR-15 style rifle lapel pin attached), a white shirt, a red tie, and a multi-colored (possibly camouflage) hat bearing the word &ldquo;TRUMP&rdquo; on the front.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robertson was also found to be the owner of a sniper rifle and numerous other firearms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robertson was fatally shot by at least one FBI agent at 6:15 a.m. in Provo, about 12 hours before Biden was due to visit the state in Salt Lake City. No agents were injured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The incident began when special agents attempted to serve arrest and search warrants at a residence,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the FBI said in a statement. &ldquo;The subject is deceased.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooting is under review by the FBI&rsquo;s Inspection Division.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A senior administration official told NBC News that Biden was briefed on the FBI raid this morning, ahead of scheduled events in New Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for Biden, said in a statement, &ldquo;The Secret Service is aware of the FBI investigation involving an individual in Utah who has exhibited threats towards a protectee.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;While we always remain in close coordination with our law enforcement partners, this is an FBI-led effort and we would refer any related questions to the FBI,&rdquo; the Secret Service said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robertson allegedly had made a threat naming Biden on Monday, and also threatened in a social media post in March to shoot Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. during a visit to New York.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A felony complaint against Robertson filed in U.S. District Court in Utah charged him with making threats against the president, making interstate threats, and influencing, impeding, and retaliating against federal law enforcement officers by threat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bragg charged Trump earlier this year with falsifying business records related to a 2016 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about her alleged sexual tryst with Trump a decade earlier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump denies having sex with Daniels, and has pleaded not guilty in the case, which is scheduled to go to trial next year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/images-show-men-armed-rifles-body-armor-coming-southern-border"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/images-show-men-armed-rifles-body-armor-coming-southern-border</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Images show men armed with rifles, body armor coming across southern border</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News has obtained images that show suspected cartel gunmen coming across the U.S. southern border in Texas toting body armor and rifles &ndash; the latest instance of armed men believed to be cartel members at the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement sources tell Fox that the three men were spotted on Saturday evening by cameras in the Fronton area and were seen carrying rifles and wearing body armor as they move through the brush.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol agents, including the agency&rsquo;s BORTAC tactical unit, were deployed to the area but found nothing. It is the same area where law enforcement arrested five suspected members of the Northeast Cartel in June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest incident came just days after Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) drone operators in Eagle Pass spotted an armed smuggler in Eagle Pass carrying a long gun and guiding a group of illegal immigrants across the Rio Grande.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instance the man made it back to Mexico, authorities said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the overwhelming majority of migrants coming across the border do not have criminal records, the large numbers of people coming across has raised concerns &ndash; particularly from Republicans &ndash; about who may be among the hundreds of thousands of people who are able to evade Border Patrol agents. The head of Border Patrol announced last week that agents nabbed four sex offenders &ndash; some with convictions of crimes against children &ndash; at the border coming into the U.S. within a single day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The border has seen record-high migrant encounters since 2021, but numbers began to trend down after the end of Title 42 on May 11. There were 144,000 migrant encounters in June, down from over 200,000 in May. However, recently there are signs numbers have gone up in July, with the Washington Post reporting that initial numbers are up by 30%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has touted moves it is taking to reduce the reliance on smugglers, who control large parts of the Mexican side of the border and who migrants often need to deal with in order to be able to access the U.S. The administration has expanded a number of lawful pathways for migrants to enter the U.S. &ndash; and has touted an anti-smuggling campaign last year which led to thousands of arrests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon has authorized 400 troops to remain at the border until the end of August beyond their 90-day mission, as 1,100 return to their home base. Meanwhile, Fox News Digital reported last week that ICE is increasing the number of its special agents at the border and that DHS is calling for more agency volunteers to help with processing at the border in the event of a surge in numbers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://americanmilitarynews.com/2023/08/chinese-using-new-smuggling-route-to-enter-us-illegally-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://americanmilitarynews.com/2023/08/chinese-using-new-smuggling-route-to-enter-us-illegally-report/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chinese using new smuggling route to enter US illegally</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An internal federal intelligence report indicates that U.S. authorities are concerned with a new Chinese migrant route that migrants are using to illegally cross into the United States through Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an internal federal intelligence report obtained by The Daily Caller, Chinese migrants are taking boats from the Bahamas to illegally enter the United States through Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Caller reported that the intelligence report lists gaps in intelligence, including where Chinese migrants are located in the Bahamas, who is coordinating the illegal immigration effort between the Bahamas and the state of Florida, and why Chinese migrants are engaging in &ldquo;self-smuggle&rdquo; operations from the Bahamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report indicates five incidents of Chinese migrants attempting to smuggle themselves into the United States from the Bahamas. A recent smuggling attempt reportedly occurred on July 16, involving six Chinese migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Chinese purchased a Bahamian registered vessel in GBI and tested the capabilities before leaving and being interdicted in Palm Beach,&rdquo; the report stated. &ldquo;All 6 Chinese migrants were repatriated to the Bahamas.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. officials and experts have expressed concerns regarding the identity of the migrants and the possible dangers they could pose to the national security of the United States..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Customs and Border Protection data indicates that Florida&rsquo;s Border Patrol agents have experienced a major increase in illegal Chinese migrant arrests According to the data, Border Patrol agents arrested 27 illegal Chinese migrants from October of 2022 to June of this year, representing a significant increase from 5 total Chinese migrant arrests in the fiscal year of 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Daily Caller, the intelligence report does not indicate how many of the Chinese migrants utilized the smuggling route between the Bahamas and Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Customs and Border Protection data also reveals that Border Patrol agents caught over 14,000 illegal Chinese migrants at the southern border from October of 2022 to June of this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Right now in China there&rsquo;s extreme pessimism, especially among people in their 20s about the future of their country, so it&rsquo;s understandable that they&rsquo;re leaving and they&rsquo;re trying to get into the United States,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homebuying Confidence at an All-Time Low</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 80% of Americans think it is a "bad" time to buy a home, a new Fannie Mae National Housing Survey finds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey, released Monday, found 82% believe it is a "bad time" to buy a house in July compared to 78% in June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monthly survey, launched in 2010, tracks attitudes on home ownership and renting, according to the organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is conducted by telephone with around 1,000 American adults who make financial decisions in households during the first three weeks of the month and is usually released around the 7th of the following month and has a margin of error of around plus or minus 0.4 or fewer percentage points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though those surveyed expressed optimism in their personal financial outlook, rising home prices, and interest rates have kept them sour on entering the housing market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While consumers are reporting confidence in the components related to their personal financial situations, it's unlikely we'll see housing sentiment catch up to other broader economic confidence measures until there is meaningful improvement to home purchase affordability," Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president, and chief economist said in a press release announcing the findings Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In July, a significant majority of consumers indicated that their jobs are stable and that their incomes are the same or better than they were 12 months ago. However, homebuying sentiment once again matched its all-time low, with only 18% telling us that it's a good time to buy a home."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also found 36% of current homeowners are less likely to sell in the current market, unchanged from the results in June's survey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Unsurprisingly, consumers continue to attribute the challenging conditions to high home prices and unfavorable mortgage rates," Duncan said. "Further, the share of consumers expecting home prices to continue to rise has also been on a steady climb since March, which may only add to perceptions of unaffordability. Additionally, we have not seen much movement in the &lsquo;good time to sell' component over the last few months, an indication that the current low levels of existing homes for sale will likely continue to persist in the near term, as also reflected in our latest forecast."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found 41% believe that home prices will continue to rise, compared to 36% in June, with decreases in both those who say prices will stay the same, 37% to 34%, and prices will drop from 26% to 24% compared to the June results.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>DeSantis launches major shakeup, replaces presidential campaign manager amid low polling</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a major shakeup weeks in the making, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign announced Tuesday it had replaced its campaign manager amid low polling in the 2024 GOP primary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis' gubernatorial chief of staff James Uthmeier replaced campaign manager Generra Peck, DeSantis' team confirmed to The Hill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peck will now work as the campaign's chief strategist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People have written Governor DeSantis&rsquo;s obituary many times," Uthmeier told The Messenger. "He&rsquo;s breaking records on fundraising and has a supporting super PAC with $100 million in the bank and an incredible ground game. Get ready."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, David Polyansky, former chief of staff for Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, will also join the campaign after serving as an adviser at the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"David Polyansky will also be a critical addition to the team given his presidential campaign experience in Iowa and work at Never Back Down," DeSantis' communications director Andrew Romeo said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican strategist and former Trump adviser Roger Stone predicted that 2024 presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will completely run out of money by the first of October.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest donor to the Florida governor said earlier this week that he was going to hold off funding until DeSantis could appeal more to moderates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is ahead of DeSantis in Republican primary polls with 53.2% to the Florida Republican's 15.1%, according to an average of polls analyzed by FiveThirtyEight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staffing changes come after the DeSantis campaign laid off more than one-third of its employees last month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://bongino.com/electric-vehicle-company-heavily-promoted-by-biden-admin-goes-bankrupt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://bongino.com/electric-vehicle-company-heavily-promoted-by-biden-admin-goes-bankrupt</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Electric Vehicle Company Heavily Promoted by Biden Admin Goes Bankrupt</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra, an electric bus manufacturing company promoted by the Biden administration, had everything it needed to succeed - and failed anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Washington Free Beacon&rsquo;s Chuck Ross reported:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra cited "various market and macroeconomic headwinds" in a Chapter 11 filing on Monday, which came after the California-based firm cut hundreds of jobs earlier this year and restructured hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding debt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra stood to rake in millions from Biden's infrastructure and green energy initiatives, the former of which included at least $5 billion in spending on electric buses alone. Biden's flagship climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, also includes spending to help cities convert from diesel buses to electric buses, a major incentive for companies like Proterra.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JoAnn Covington, Proterra's chief legal officer, acknowledged last year that tax credits and federal grants under Biden's bills were a major incentive for the company. Grants to purchase electric buses and to create electric vehicle charging infrastructure would ​"open up opportunities to accelerate adoption of battery-electric and zero-emissions vehicles to all the other commercial segments on the cusp of being electrified," Covington said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm held non-public shares of proterra, which she sold in mid 2021 to an undisclosed buyer, pocketing over a $1 million profit in the process. She pledged to disclose the buyer, but never did. Proterra's stock only crashed from there, and Granholm&rsquo;s 240,000 shares would be worth roughly $60,000 total as of writing, had she still held them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year in February, Proterra&rsquo;s CEO Gareth Joyce was appointed by Biden to his Export Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year prior, Biden hosted a virtual White House event that spotlighted Proterra&rsquo;s business, which included the president of the company giving a virtual tour of the company&rsquo;s manufacturing facility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/biden-admin-has-given-2-35-billion-to-taliban-controlled-afghanistan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://freebeacon.com/national-security/biden-admin-has-given-2-35-billion-to-taliban-controlled-afghanistan/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden Admin Has Given $2.35 Billion to Taliban-Controlled Afghanistan</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has provided more than $2.35 billion in taxpayer dollars to Afghanistan since the Taliban retook control of the government in 2021 following a deadly U.S. evacuation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States remains Afghanistan&rsquo;s top patron, even as lawmakers and federal oversight officials warn that these funds could be propping up the Taliban&rsquo;s terrorist government. Updated spending figures were disclosed Tuesday in a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a federal watchdog that documents waste, fraud, and abuse related to U.S. expenditures in the war-torn country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around $1.7 billion "remained available for possible disbursement" at the time of SIGAR&rsquo;s report, meaning that this money is ready to flow into non-profit groups and other entities working on reconstruction projects in Afghanistan. With the Taliban exerting control over nearly every sector of the country&rsquo;s infrastructure&mdash;including the NGO community&mdash;it is more than likely that a sizable portion of these funds will end up in the terror group&rsquo;s coffers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest figures are certain to increase congressional pressure on the Biden administration to stop sending taxpayer funds into Afghanistan until officials can ensure the Taliban is not stealing the money. John Sopko, head of SIGAR, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in April that he "cannot assure this committee or the American taxpayer we are not currently funding the Taliban." Sopko also accused the Biden administration of blocking his investigatory efforts and refusing to hand over documents that could show if the Taliban is being propped up by American cash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the two years since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan following the Biden administration's withdrawal of American forces in 2021, it has become increasingly clear that the terrorist group views international assistance as a "revenue stream," according to SIGAR&rsquo;s latest report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Institute of Peace recently warned the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the primary vehicle for U.S. spending in Afghanistan, that the Taliban is "pushing for ever-increasing degrees of credit and control over the delivery of aid." United Nations officials also disclosed to the watchdog that "the Taliban have effectively infiltrated and influenced most UN-managed assistance programming."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reality is raising questions about the nearly $2 billion in funds the Biden administration has made available for disbursement in the country. As U.S. aid money flows to the country, "Taliban interference with NGO work escalated, leading to a steady decline in humanitarian access in 2023, with a 32 percent increase in incidents between January and May 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022," according to the report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taliban government also has not moderated its jihadi principles since seizing the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As SIGAR and congressional oversight committees raise concerns about the Biden administration&rsquo;s push to pump money into Afghanistan, the government agencies in control of these expenditures are not cooperating with investigations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sopko revealed in April that the "the Department of State, USAID, the U.N., and other agencies are refusing to give us basic information that we or any other oversight body would need to ensure safe stewardship of tax dollars."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sopko revealed in April that the "the Department of State, USAID, the U.N., and other agencies are refusing to give us basic information that we or any other oversight body would need to ensure safe stewardship of tax dollars."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"More troubling," he added, "State and USAID have instructed their employees not to talk to SIGAR, and in one recent instance, State told one of its contractors not to participate in a SIGAR audit." The White House also would not cooperate with SIGAR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress has had similar experiences, with USAID declining to tell investigators what safeguards were put in place to ensure taxpayer cash is not stolen by the Taliban.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/07/nathan-cruz-cousin-of-uvalde-school-shooter-arrested-for-threatening-school/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/08/07/nathan-cruz-cousin-of-uvalde-school-shooter-arrested-for-threatening-school/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cousin, 17, of Uvalde school shooter arrested for allegedly threatening &lsquo;to do the same thing&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cousin to Uvalde school shooter Salvador Ramos was arrested after he was accused of threatening to shoot up a school and shoot his sister in the head, according to authorities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nathan Cruz, 17, allegedly told his sister he planned &ldquo;to do the same thing&rdquo; as his sicko cousin, who shot and killed 19 students and two staffers inside Robb Elementary School last year, according to an arrest warrant obtained by the San Antonio Express-News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Antonio officers responded to a mental health call after the teen suspect&rsquo;s mother grew worried Monday morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The suspect&rsquo;s mother was especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time, and for the fact that they live near an elementary school,&rdquo; the affidavit reportedly stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz also allegedly mentioned how &ldquo;school is starting soon,&rdquo; according to KSAT, which also obtained the warrant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz reportedly denied making any threats when speaking with detectives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz&rsquo;s mother said she overheard her son attempting to buy an AR-15 illegally over the phone, according to the warrant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family lives across the street from the Gardendale Early Learning Program, the newspaper reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the school shooting threat, he also threatened to shoot his sister in the head, the mother alleged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man&rsquo;s sister believed his threat was credible &ldquo;due to the recent history of their family and the suspect&rsquo;s knowledge of his cousin&rsquo;s actions,&rdquo; according to the San Antonio Express-News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz was booked on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to the public and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat to a family member, according to online records from the Bexar County jail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when you think Disney may have figured things out&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/08/07/disney-teams-up-with-transgender-tiktok-influencer-to-promote-girls-apparel-i-literally-look-like-minnie-mouse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/08/07/disney-teams-up-with-transgender-tiktok-influencer-to-promote-girls-apparel-i-literally-look-like-minnie-mouse/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disney Teams Up with Transgender TikTok Influencer to Promote Girls Apparel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Walt Disney Co. has teamed up with a transgender TikTok influencer to promote apparel for girls &mdash; specifically, Minnie Mouse-themed clothes that include a red dress, yellow pumps, and a red hair bow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender influencer Seann Altman &mdash; a biological male who identifies as &ldquo;gender fluid&rdquo; &mdash; created a promotional TikTok video for Disney Style,&nbsp; the company&rsquo;s social media brand promoting Disney-themed clothing, makeup, and accessories.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, which was first reported by the Twitter account @LeftismForU, he provides a dress-up tutorial to look like Minnie Mouse. The video was subsequently posted to Disney Style&rsquo;s official TikTok account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1688344659003629569"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1688344659003629569</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you just heard, Altman models a red dress, which he accessorizes with a white petticoat, yellow high-heel shoes, and a belt. He then adds artificial buns to his hair to simulate Minnie&rsquo;s ears and tops it off with Minnie&rsquo;s signature red bow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video is the latest example of Disney promoting transgenderism and gender non-conformity. As Breitbart News reported, Disneyland recently employed a mustachioed transvestite to welcome young girls into the park&rsquo;s Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past couple of years, Disney has fought Florida over its anti-grooming Parental Rights in Education law, created multiple transgender characters for its children&rsquo;s shows, put gay characters at the center of its big-budget movies, and even launched an LGBTQ-themed apparel line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Disney+ streaming service hosted This Is Me: Pride Celebration Spectacular, a musical special on YouTube starring drag queen Nina West, with performances of popular Disney songs re-imagined with LGBTQ themes.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3,000+ U.S. Sailors, Marines Reach Red Sea as Biden&rsquo;s Middle East Build-Up Continues</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwards of 3,000 U.S. sailors and Marines sailed into the Red Sea on Monday after transiting the Suez Canal in a pre-announced deployment, the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Fifth Fleet said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reinforcements were carried aboard the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing &ldquo;greater flexibility and maritime capability&rdquo; to the Fifth Fleet, the statement seen by AFP added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their arrival followed a U.S. announcement last month it would deploy a destroyer, F-35 and F-16 warplanes, along with the Amphibious Readiness Group/Marine Expeditionary Unit, to the Middle East to deter Iran from seizing ships in the Gulf.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military says Iran has either seized or attempted to take control of nearly 20 internationally flagged ships in the region over the past two years and the Biden White House wants to see more forces in the region to stand ready to engage Iran if required, as Breitbart News reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USS Bataan is an amphibious assault ship which can carry fixed-wing and rotary aircraft as well as landing craft. The USS Carter Hall, a dock landing ship, transports Marines, their gear, and lands them ashore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mike Pence accidentally ADMITS he had legal ability to turn 2020 election over to House of Representatives</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Trump&rsquo;s arraignment on "conspiracy" charges last week, the 2024 GOP frontrunner&rsquo;s former vice president, Mike Pence, said that the 2020 election results would have been turned over to the House of Representatives if he rejected the Electoral College votes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1688640553808801792"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1688640553808801792</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Trump was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to defraud the government, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. He pleaded not guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the indictment from Special Counsel Jack Smith, he alleges that Trump enlisted six co-conspirators to "assist him in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indictment alleges that Trump was "determined to remain in power" after the 2020 election, and for the two months following the election "the Defendant spread lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he actually won."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"After it became public on the afternoon of January 6 that the Vice President would not fraudulently alter the election results, a large and angry crowd&mdash;including many individuals whom the Defendant had deceived into believing the Vice President could and might change the election results&mdash;violently attacked the Capitol and halted the proceeding. As violence ensued, the Defendant and co-conspirators exploited the disruption by redoubling efforts to levy false claims of election fraud and convince Members of Congress to further delay the certification based on those claims," the indictment stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence is currently running against his former administration partner for the GOP nomination, with Pence usually polling in the single digits While Trump leads anywhere from 40 to 60 points.</span></p>

<p><strong>Sikh Man Who Turned the Tables on Shoplifter Facing Criminal Charges</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As RedState reported, a Sikh convenience store owner turned the tables on a shoplifter as he attempted to get away with thousands of dollars of stolen merchandise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The viral scene unfolded in California, showing a man shoveling entire shelves worth of tobacco and other products into a trash can while taunting the owner with proclamations that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing you can do.&rdquo; The shoplifter quickly learned that wasn&rsquo;t true, though, as he was tackled to the ground and beaten with a rod.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1686713571994959872"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1686713571994959872</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play 1:15-1:56</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, while many California cities have no desire to actually enforce the laws against people who steal from business owners and put them in financial peril, they are interested in enforcing battery laws involving the protection of said businesses. According to a new report, the Sikh man is now facing criminal charges as local police investigate the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are making the argument that the force used on the shoplifter in the video was excessive, and as a purely legal matter, that may be true. The shoplifter was begging for mercy while the store owner continued to swing back and strike him. The question is at what point the store owner is expected to disengage, and he likely passed that point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I think that argument misses the broader point of what normally law-abiding citizens are dealing with and what the ultimate consequences are of refusing to enforce the law against criminal vagrants. These business owners (and also just people walking down the street) are being ignored by local police and prosecutors as they are harassed, assaulted, and stolen from. It was just a matter of time before someone reached their breaking point and lashed out.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Illegal immigrants in colleges soar to nearly 2% of population, study finds</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 408,000 students without legal documentation to be in the country enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities, yet another system impacted by the surge in illegal immigration, according to a new study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new report by the American Immigration Council and the Presidents&rsquo; Alliance on Higher Education, found that undocumented migrants now account for nearly 2 percent of the higher education population.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority, the authors noted, arrived in the U.S. in their formative years, either as children or teenagers and most often through president Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program that blocked deportation of certain foreign youth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These students, often referred to as "Dreamers," have grown up in &ldquo;American neighborhoods and attended American schools,&rdquo; and now they are attending U.S. colleges, often on the American taxpayers' dime. Recent data shows that taxpayers pay $182 billion each year to provide services and benefits to illegals and their dependents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current total of illegal alien college students actually represents a slight decrease from 2019, when 427,000 undocumented students were enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report noted that &ldquo;undocumented students in higher education are concentrated in a small number of states.&rdquo; In fact, 75 percent of undocumented students reside in&nbsp; 12 states. The vast majority of this 75 percent hail from just four states: California, Texas, Florida and New York.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study also gives significant detail on which colleges and universities are the biggest draw for illegal aliens: more than 77 percent are enrolled in &ldquo;public two- and four-year colleges and universities, with a significant proportion of these students attending community colleges,&rdquo; it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/08/06/sick-joke-megan-rapinoe-ends-her-career-with-missed-penalty-kick-that-costs-u-s-the-world-cup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/08/06/sick-joke-megan-rapinoe-ends-her-career-with-missed-penalty-kick-that-costs-u-s-the-world-cup/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team USA lost last night, and I&rsquo;m THRILLED!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Megan Rapinoe Ends Her Career with Missed Penalty Kick that Costs U.S. the World Cup</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The international career of Megan Rapinoe ended in a dramatic penalty shoot-out against Sweden on Sunday with her failed kick at goal helping to send the U.S.A. team crashing out of the soccer World Cup underway in New Zealand and Australia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe and Sophia Smith missed penalties that could have given the U.S. the win, and Kelley O&rsquo;Hara missed the Americans&rsquo; final shot to give Sweden the opening it needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe, who I&rsquo;ve covered in the past, spoke to the media afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1688167422371536896"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1688167422371536896</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result ended the international career of Rapinoe, the Golden Boot winner of the 2019 tournament who is retiring after the World Cup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the earliest exit in tournament history for the United States, four-time winners of the World Cup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States claimed the last two Women&rsquo;s World Cups and four of the eight editions held before this year&rsquo;s event Down Under.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had never gone out before the semi-final stage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time they have been sent packing in the last 16 having won just one game and that an unconvincing 3-0 defeat of Vietnam.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brought off the bench against Sweden, her final act for her country was to put her penalty over the bar and send her country&rsquo;s hopes with it into oblivion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of soccer fans on twitter moved to voice their exasperation with her final effort.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe pushes that equal pay talk, and then this happens&hellip; gotta love it.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooter Sentenced To Death By Jury</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A jury on Wednesday sentenced the man who gunned down 11 people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh to death, nearly five years after the attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooter, whom I will not name, was found guilty in June of all 63 counts he was facing, including 11 counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of hate crimes resulting in death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jury&rsquo;s unanimous decision was announced by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Colville, who presided over the trial, which took place in downtown Pittsburgh. The judge will officially sentence the shooter to death later this week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victims were from three Jewish congregations who gathered at the Tree of Life synagogue on October 27, 2018. Two other worshipers and five police officers were also wounded by the gunman, who unloaded a Colt AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and three Glock .357 handguns during his attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victims of the shooting were: Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil and David Rosenthal, Bernice and Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, and Irving Younger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooting is considered by authorities to be the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys representing the shooter asked for a life sentence if he pleaded guilty, but prosecutors, with the support of most of the victims&rsquo; families, refused and took the case to trial to pursue the death penalty. The shooter&rsquo;s lawyers also argued that he was impaired by mental illness and a delusional belief system took over his thinking, dictating that he had to kill Jews to stop a genocide of white people, the Associated Press reported.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;He turned this place of worship into an exhibit in his criminal trial,&rdquo; U.S. Attorney Eric Olshan said while arguing for jurors to recommend the death penalty, according to the Pittsburgh Gazette.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A criminal complaint showed that the man told authorities he intentionally targeted the synagogue because he hoped to kill Jewish people. The shooter&rsquo;s defense attorneys acknowledged that he had done the shooting but asked jurors to &ldquo;scrutinize his intent.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now go across the pond for this one!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/08/02/uk-tories-enforce-diversity-quotas-for-new-members-of-parliament/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/08/02/uk-tories-enforce-diversity-quotas-for-new-members-of-parliament/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UK Tories Enforce Diversity Quotas for New Members of Parliament.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Kingdom&rsquo;s &lsquo;Conservative&rsquo; Party has implemented new diversity quotas and guidelines for selecting candidates &ndash; would-be Members of Parliament (MPs). The targets include age as well as ethnicity and gender.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity quotas are in place even before candidates are considered as the party&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sifting Committee,&rdquo; which is responsible for sorting through applicants after applying for the position, must have specific characteristics:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;The Sifting Committee must comprise a minimum of one woman and one young person under the age of 30. The additional Association members of the Committee should reflect the different interests of the constituency, i.e. should have a balance of gender, age and ethnicity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the initial sift, the Selection Committee must &ldquo;recognise their responsibility&rdquo; to ensure that candidates are chosen in a way that &ldquo;displays diversity and variety and which has a due regard to the local profile of the constituency&rdquo; and guarantees a balance of genders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selection rules also state that the process must be &ldquo;inclusive and free from discrimination&rdquo; and &ldquo;fully acknowledge and embrace diversity,&rdquo; except when considering female candidates, in which case &ldquo;some degree of positive discrimination is permitted.&rdquo; The rules add that anything considered &ldquo;indirect discrimination&rdquo; is prohibited; meaning, any requirement that could have a &ldquo;disproportionate impact&rdquo; on one group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;President Donald Trump highlighted the Conservative&rsquo;s shift to the &ldquo;far left&rdquo; in an interview with Nigel Farage earlier this year. More recently, the party expelled a mayor for &lsquo;repenting&lsquo; after attending a Pride event.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Orlando Magic donated $50,000 to Ron DeSantis Super Pac</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orlando Magic NBA team has donated $50,000 to a Super Pac supporting the presidential bid of Florida&rsquo;s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Federal Election Commission records, the Never Back Down Super Pac received the donation made by the basketball team on 26 June. Further results showed the team making donations to other political causes in past years, with $500 going to Conservative Results in 2016, $2,000 to Maverick Pac USA in 2014 and another $500 to Linda Chapin for Congress in 2000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an initial statement to Popular Information, a Magic spokesperson said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t comment publicly on political contributions.&rdquo; However, in a later follow-up statement, a spokesperson clarified the donation, saying that the check was &ldquo;dated/delivered on May 19&rdquo;, five days before DeSantis declared his presidential bid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This gift was given before Governor DeSantis entered the presidential race. [It] was given as a Florida business in support of a Florida governor for the continued prosperity of central Florida,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Never Back Down&rsquo;s website, the Super Pac describes itself as a &ldquo;grassroots movement to elect Governor Ron DeSantis for president in 2024&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The donation has drawn criticism online, particularly given the Magic&rsquo;s claims of supporting &ldquo;diversity, equity and inclusion all year long&rdquo; and DeSantis&rsquo;s culture wars in which he announced plans to block DEI programs in state colleges among other legislation targeting minority and marginalized groups including LGBTQ+ communities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orlando Magic team is under Amway North America, a multi-level marketing firm co-established by Richard DeVos, the late father-in-law of Trump&rsquo;s education secretary Betsy DeVos.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the DeVos family has made multiple donations to conservative organizations. In 2006, the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation made a $540,000 donation to Focus on the Family, a Colorado-based organization that opposes same-sex marriage and abortions, HuffPost reports. In 2008, Richard DeVos donated $100,000 to Florida4Marriage, a group that campaigned to add a state constitutional ban on same-sex marriages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a sacred issue of respecting marriage,&rdquo; Richard DeVos said in a 2009 interview in reference to his donation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following reports of the donation, the National Basketball Players Association, a union representing NBA players, issued a statement on Wednesday, calling the donation &ldquo;alarming&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A political contribution from the Orlando Magic is alarming given recent comments and policies of its beneficiary. NBA governors, players and personnel have the right to express their personal political views, including through donations and statements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;However, if contributions are made on behalf of an entire team, using money earned through the labor of its employees, it is incumbent upon the team governors to consider the diverse values and perspectives of staff and players.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Magic&rsquo;s donation does not represent player support for the recipient,&rdquo; the union said.</span></p>

<p><strong>Shakeups Continue at ESPN As NBA Analyst Mark Jackson Is Fired After 10 Years With The Network</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Jackson is a New York native who played his college basketball at St. John&rsquo;s before being chosen by the Knicks in the first round of the 1987 draft. He spent two separate stints with the franchise, and his time in the shadows of The City That Never Sleeps had him ready for the big stage when he wanted to transition to television.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He would go on to a coaching career by taking the helm in Golden State, just before the eventual arrival of Steve Kerr and a slew of NBA titles. Still, he rebounded nicely, and would later famously team with Mike Breen and Van Gundy to form one of the best broadcasting trios in all of sports. That is &ndash; until this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Mark Jackson released a long statement, saying goodbye:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This morning, unexpectedly, I was informed that my services were no longer needed at ESPN. Although shocked and dismayed with the suddenness of it all, I would like to thank ESPN and all the staff of the NBA ESPN crew for allowing me to be a part of the organization for the past 15+ years. I would also like to thank the NBA fans watching at home and in the arenas throughout the league for all of your support. To the NBA, a heartfelt thank you for allowing a kid to continue to accomplish his dreams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It has been an honor to sit beside two LEGENDS in the business, who are like brothers to me, Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy, and learn so much from them,&rdquo; the former Knicks standout continued. &ldquo;Lisa Salters is a GOAT and like a sister to me and I&rsquo;m so proud of the work she continues to do. To the best producer in the world, and my friend, Tim Corrigan, I give the utmost gratitude and thanks for always inspiring and supporting me. To all of the staff and crew, that may have never been seen on camera&hellip; please know that you were always seen by me and so greatly appreciated.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson then concluded his sign-off from The Worldwide Leader in Sports gracefully, giving praise to God on his way out the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Finally, I wish greater measures of success to the new ESPN team. May they continue to elevate this game that has given me a home and a life. I leave ESPN with nothing but gratitude, all the while knowing that my highest praise goes to God! Through it all, He has always sustained me and His grace allows me to know that there are greater blessings ahead. I look forward to what He has in store next.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson&rsquo;s layoff is the latest in a series of cost-cutting moves by the network, which has experienced a sharp drop in popularity and profitability in recent years.</span></p>]]></description>
