<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Over 12,000 US Troops Head toward Middle East on 10 Warships</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As tensions equate to World War Three levels in the Middle East, over 12,000 US Navy and Marine Corps personnel aboard ten warships are heading towards the Middle East, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III announced a series of actions to bolster the US military presence in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group has been redirected to the Central Command area of responsibility in addition to the Navy&rsquo;s most advanced nuclear aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, which is currently positioned in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group now joins the USS Gerald R. Ford group, bringing the number of American warships in the region to 10.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 4,500 sailors on board the US aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, accompanied by five other ships carrying over 1,600 US troops.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier is 5,000 service members, with further ships carrying another 1,000 troops.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin placed 2,000 forces on standby to &ldquo;be ready to deploy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forces will now be ready to be deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean within 24 hours, Fox News reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order came just days after a special operations Marine Corps unit participating in exercises departed early &ldquo;as a result of emerging events.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, Austin placed an unspecified number of US troops under &ldquo;prepare to deploy&rdquo; orders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin said in a statement:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have placed an additional number of forces on prepare to deploy orders as part of prudent contingency planning, to increase their readiness and ability to quickly respond as required.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, up to six Chinese Warships have been spotted in waters near the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a statement:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We need to enter under the best possible conditions, and this is what we are doing now, as the next stage of war approaches.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimizing the danger.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We will narrow the risks to our forces over the next stages. This is why we have once again urged residents of Gaza to keep moving south,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Daily Fetched reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many media outlets have taken Hagari&rsquo;s words as meaning they are preparing for an imminent ground assault.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/israel-mideast-assets/2023/10/22/id/1139191/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/israel-mideast-assets/2023/10/22/id/1139191/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>US Rushes Advanced THAAD Missile Defense to Mideast</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fears that the Israel-Hamas war could mushroom into a wider Middle East conflict rose on Sunday with Washington warning of a significant risk to U.S. interests in the region as ally Israel pounded Gaza and clashes on its border with Lebanon intensified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza's Health Ministry said 266 Palestinians, including 117 children, had been killed by Israeli air strikes in the past 24 hours in the enclave, to which Israel laid "total siege" after a deadly mass infiltration into Israel by Hamas gunmen on Oct. 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In neighboring Syria, where Hamas' main regional backer Iran has a military presence, Israeli missiles hit Damascus and Aleppo international airports early on Sunday, putting both out of service and killing two workers, Syrian state media said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, the Iran-backed Hezbollah group has clashed with Israeli forces in support of Hamas in the deadliest escalation of frontier violence since an Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With violence around its heavily guarded borders increasing, Israel on Sunday added 14 communities close to Lebanon and Syria to its evacuation contingency plan in the north of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh called on the international community to create "a united front" to stop Israel's attacks against Gaza and allow in desperately needed aid which has only begun to trickle in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We place at the top of our priorities stopping the Israeli aggression (...) and bringing in medical and relief aid to prevent a major humanitarian catastrophe," Shtayyeh said during a meeting with 25 ambassadors, representatives and consuls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Saturday that Washington would send more military assets to the Middle East in support of Israel and strengthen the U.S. defense posture in the region after "recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces" - a reference to Hezbollah, Palestinian and other militants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin told ABC's "This Week" program on Sunday: "We're concerned about potential escalation. In fact, what we're seeing ... is the prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation ... our advice is: don&rsquo;t," he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin said a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and extra Patriot air defense missile system battalions will be sent to the region and more troops put on standby.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iranian security officials told Reuters Iran's strategy was for Middle East proxies like Hezbollah to pursue limited strikes on Israeli and U.S. targets but to avoid a major escalation that would draw in Tehran, a high-wire act for the Islamic Republic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel unleashed an aerial blitz on Gaza to its southwest after Hamas militants breached the border on Oct. 7 and killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and took 212 hostages back to Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza's Health Ministry said on Sunday that Israel's air and missile strikes in retaliation had killed at least 4,741 and wounded 15,898, with over a million of the densely populated enclave's 2.3 million people displaced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel has amassed tanks and troops near the fenced border around Gaza for a planned ground invasion aiming to annihilate Hamas, after several inconclusive wars dating to its seizure of power there in 2007, after Israel ended a 38-year occupation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Egyptian guards on the border with Gaza suffered minor injuries on Sunday after being accidentally hit by fragments of a shell from an Israeli tank, the Egyptian army said. Israel's defense force expressed "sorrow regarding the incident," which it said was being investigated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamas's armed wing said it had fired more rockets at Tel Aviv on Sunday. There was no immediate word of damage or casualties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Israel keeping up daily bombings, Palestinians said they received renewed Israeli military warnings to move from Gaza's north to the south to avoid the deadliest theater of the war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said military leaflets dropped on the territory, just 45 km (28 miles) long, contained the added warning that they could be identified as sympathizers with a "terrorist organization" if they stayed put.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza's Health Ministry said most of the dead from air strikes over the past 24 hours were in Gaza's south. Israel says it is only targeting militants and that they often use residential buildings as cover.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first humanitarian aid convoy allowed into Gaza since war erupted arrived in southern Gaza from Egypt on Saturday after days of negotiations. The U.N. said the 20-truck convoy brought life-saving medical supplies and some food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second convoy of around 19 trucks loaded with medical and food supplies entered the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on Sunday and was being inspected before proceeding into Gaza, sources said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An explosion and ambulance sirens were heard on Sunday afternoon, shortly after the second convoy had entered the crossing, witnesses said. The cause and exact location were not immediately clear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.N. humanitarian office said the volume of aid entering so far was just 4% of the daily average before the hostilities and a fraction of what was needed with food, water, medicines and fuel stocks running out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deprived of electricity and water, Gazans in the southern town of Khan Younis said they were struggling to feed their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are suffering extremely, waiting since dawn to get bread. If this continues for two more days it will be catastrophic,&rdquo; said Saleh Skafi, a father of four from north Gaza now sheltering in Khan Younis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, on this note - let&rsquo;s take a look at the overall situation across the globe&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/20/biden-government-war-fears-israel-hamas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.axios.com/2023/10/20/biden-government-war-fears-israel-hamas</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Behind the Curtain: Rattled U.S. government fears wars could spread</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never before have we talked to so many top government officials who, in private, are so worried about so many overseas conflicts at once.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We don't like to sound dire. But to sound a siren of clinical, clear-eyed realism: U.S. officials say this confluence of crises poses epic concern and historic danger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the scenes: Officials tell us that inside the White House, this was the heaviest, most chilling week since President Biden took office just over 1,000 days ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Defense Secretary Bob Gates &mdash; who ran the Pentagon under presidents of both parties, George W. Bush and Barack Obama &mdash; tells us America is facing the most crises since World War II ended 78 years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explains the White House's system overload like this: "There's this gigantic funnel that sits over the table in the Situation Room. And all the problems in the world end up coming through that funnel to the same eight or 10 people. There's a limit to the bandwidth those eight or 10 people can have."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Israel's response to the Hamas terrorist attack, and growing fear of a spreading war that reaches to Iran and beyond. Officials point to the protests, threats and deadly, anti-American warnings of Arab nations after they thought &mdash; incorrectly &mdash; Israel struck a hospital in Gaza, killing hundreds. This is a preview of what they fully expect will be a worldwide response to the expected Israeli invasion of Gaza.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is deploying two aircraft carriers to the region. A U.S. Navy destroyer on Thursday shot down missiles from Yemen that appeared headed toward Israel. U.S. troops were fired on this week by drones in Syria and Iraq.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vladimir Putin meeting in China this week with Xi Jinping to further strengthen their anti-America alliance. In a new Foreign Affairs article that top officials are sharing, Gates argues that both leaders believe America and other big democracies "are past their prime and have entered an irreversible decline." Putin and Xi sniff weakness and are activating on many fronts&hellip;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Reuters headline says it all: "Russia says it is coordinating Middle East policy with China."</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A malicious Iran. It's unclear how involved Iran was in orchestrating or assisting the Hamas terrorist attack &mdash; but officials seem certain there are ties. More worrisome: U.S. officials fear Hezbollah &mdash; a much bigger terrorist group than Hamas, funded by Iran &mdash; will strike the moment Israel gets stuck in Gaza.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden said Thursday night in his Oval Office address: "Iran is supporting Russia in Ukraine, and it's supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there's the unhinged leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, and his frequent testing of long-range, nuclear-capable missiles. As Gates points out, the combined nuclear arsenal of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea "could within a few years be nearly double the size of" America's.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A new weapon is being deployed in all these conflicts: a massive spread of doctored or wholly fake videos to manipulate what people see and think in real time. The architects of these new technologies, in background conversations after demonstrating new capabilities soon to be released, say even the sharpest eyes looking for fake videos will have an impossible time detecting what's real. (We'll have a column coming soon to Go Deeper on this topic).</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fake video, on top of bots (fake people) and fake written content, is being used aggressively by all anti-American actors, intelligence officials say. Some experts estimate that more than 90% of content on the internet will soon be fake or manipulated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What scares officials is how all five threats could fuse into one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Department on Thursday issued a rare "Worldwide Caution," warning U.S. travelers abroad of "increased tensions in various locations around the world" that raise "the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These simultaneous threats are hitting at the very moment the American political system seems &mdash; and sometimes is &mdash; literally broken.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not just that Republicans don't have a House speaker and can't seem to elect one, or that we might shut down the government in the middle of this mess, or that we're hurtling toward another toxic presidential election in which big chunks of both parties want different candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former top intelligence officials tell us domestic unrest is one of their biggest fears &mdash; whether it's triggered by court rulings against President Trump or protests over war in the Middle East. Biden allies frame these flare-ups as a reminder that global chaos requires calm and experience. "With age comes wisdom," Ron Klain, Biden's first chief of staff, told us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there has been a total collapse of people's trust in the opposing party, the media, what they see or share on social platforms, and even the top-secret intelligence the government relies on to measure these threats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, as much as the five individual threats above, is what worries officials. They know things could get worse &mdash; fast &mdash; and require tough actions &mdash; fast. And no one knows whether Congress or the public could unite in an emergency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/10/22/londons-met-police-declare-calling-for-jihad-is-lawful-as-word-has-number-of-meanings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/10/22/londons-met-police-declare-calling-for-jihad-is-lawful-as-word-has-number-of-meanings/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>London Police Declare Calling for Jihad Is Lawful as Word has &lsquo;Number of Meanings&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police have come under criticism for their seemingly lax approach towards pro-Palestine demonstrations and for giving excuses for those calling for &ldquo;jihad&rdquo; against Israel on the streets of the British capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 100,000 anti-Israel protesters took to the streets of London on Saturday. Ahead of the demonstration, the Met police warned activists that they may face arrest if they were seen to be supporting proscribed terror groups like Hamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while several people were arrested and some investigations continue, the police force drew considerable backlash for appearing to excuse calls for jihad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to footage of a speaker calling for jihad while standing in front of a placard calling on the &ldquo;Muslim armies&rdquo; of the world to attack Israel, the Met said on X: &ldquo;The word jihad has a number of meanings but we know the public will most commonly associate it with terrorism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have specialist counter-terrorism officers here in the operations room who have particular knowledge in this area. They have assessed this video, filmed at the protest in central London today, and have not identified any offences arising from the specific clip.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, recognising the way language like this will be interpreted by the public and the divisive impact it will have, officers have identified the man involved and will be speaking to him shortly to discourage any repeat of similar chanting.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet users on social media noted that the Metropolitan Police&rsquo;s own hate crime guide states: &ldquo;The offence of incitement to hatred occurs when someone acts in a way that is threatening and intended to stir up hatred&hellip; Hate content may include: messages calling for violence against a specific person or group.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1715732342604505530"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1715732342604505530</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Arabic word literally translates to &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; and has been used in other, more peaceful contexts, observers noted that the context of the call for jihad on Saturday in London was a literal war cry against Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalist Andy Ngo, who covered the London rally on Saturday, said: &ldquo;I was there and the speaker was specifically talking about getting military leaders and countries to mobilize armies of Muslims to go to Palestinian territories to assist the (those who do jihad) against Israel in a holy battle for Islam.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post has received widespread derision, with author Douglas Murray writing: &ldquo;Yes, oh Imam of the Met Police. Those guys definitely looked like they were calling for an intense inner spiritual struggle. Got it in one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political commentator Darren Grimes added: &ldquo;Shouting &lsquo;Jihad! Jihad! Jihad!&rsquo; won&rsquo;t get you arrested in Britain, but telling a copper that they look like your lesbian nan as a teenager will see six officers pound your door down.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Pro-Palestinian Protesters Stage &lsquo;Insurrection&rsquo; in U.S. Capitol Office Building</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-Palestinian protesters, who want a ceasefire that would benefit the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza, stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday and staged a protest inside the Cannon Rotunda that one observer likened to an &ldquo;insurrection.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cannon Rotunda is part of the Cannon House Office Building. It is separate from the iconic Capitol building but is considered part of the Capitol complex. It is the oldest congressional office building on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who falsely accused Israel of bombing a Gaza hospital Tuesday, addressed the protesters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox 5 in Washington, DC, reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large group of pro-Palestinian protesters are demonstrating inside the Cannon Rotunda on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cannon House Office Building holds the House Committee offices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Capitol Police say demonstrations are not allowed inside Congressional Buildings and are working to clear the crowd. Police have already detained some individuals as chants of &ldquo;ceasefire&rdquo; are echoing around the building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left-wing protesters have staged demonstrations inside the Capitol before, but none have been treated the way participants in the January 6, 2021 protesters have been treated, many of whom were detained and given harsh sentences for non-violent offenses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. has seen anti-Israel protests in major cities and on college campuses since a Hamas terror attack Oct. 7 killed 1,400 Israelis and wounded roughly 4,400 more. About 200 people &mdash; including some Americans &mdash; were taken to Gaza as hostages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI Director Christopher Wray called the Capitol riot &ldquo;domestic terrorism.&rdquo; In this case, the pro-Palestinian protest is supporting terrorism against Israelis and Americans; a ceasefire would allow Hamas to escape without consequences for its atrocities.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harvard and Columbia students lose law firm job offer for anti-Israel stance</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major law firm has rescinded its offer of employment to three students at Harvard and Columbia law schools who endorsed statements that blamed Israel for a series of terrorist attacks by Hamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law firm Davis Polk notified employees in an internal email that the firm had withdrawn job offers to three students from Harvard and Columbia who had signed statements that blamed the Israeli government for the attacks by Hamas. The Columbia statement went further and said the attacks were justified acts of resistance. The attacks and the subsequent military response by Israel have claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;These statements are simply contrary to our firm&rsquo;s values and we thus concluded that rescinding these offers was appropriate in upholding our responsibility to provide a safe and inclusive work environment for all Davis Polk employees,&rdquo; the firm said in the email to employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm's action is the latest example of students losing employment offers because of their support for the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryna Workman, a law student at New York University and the president of the student bar association, lost an employment offer from the law firm Winston &amp; Strawn after supporting a statement that said: &ldquo;Israel bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to withdrawn job offers, other prominent figures have urged that the students be named publicly and face professional consequences. A number of the 31 student groups who signed the Harvard statement have since withdrawn their support for the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billionaire Bill Ackman, a Harvard alum, asked that the names of the students who signed the statement be publicly released "so as to ensure that none of us inadvertently hire any of their members."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman echoed Ackman, saying, "I would like to know so I know never to hire these people."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Vance's new bill would protect mothers who exit the workforce to care for their babies from undue health care costs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Sens. J.D. Vance (Ohio) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) introduced legislation Tuesday that would ensure that mothers "who choose to prioritize their child's early development and recover rather than return to work" after giving birth won't be retroactively stripped of their health care premiums for having done so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 requires covered companies with over 50 employees to give their workers 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave in a 12-month period for the birth of a child as well as in cases of adoption. Furthermore, it requires the "continuation of their group health benefits under the same conditions as if they had not taken leave."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill, entitled "Fairness for Stay-At-Home Parents Act," would amend the FMLA to "prohibit an employer from recovering any health care premium paid by the employer for an employee if the employee fails to return to work due to the birth of a child, and for other purposes."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to preventing clawbacks, the legislation would have employers continue their health premium contributions for the duration of the 12-week leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our laws should not penalize new parents who choose to stay home to care for their newborn babies," Vance said in a statement. "We should celebrate and promote young families, not punish them. This legislation would relieve a serious financial burden for working families all over America and steer Washington in a more pro-family direction."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America appears to be in dire need of a "pro-family direction."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Census Bureau revealed in November 2022 that less than 24% of children under the age of 15 living in normal families had a stay-at-home mother. Only 1% had a stay-at-home father.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pew Research Center indicated that as of 2021, 26% of mothers stayed home with their children and 7% of fathers stayed home with their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Mayo Clinic, over half of women return to work after their maternity leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are fewer people staying home to raise their children, but fewer Americans are having children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated in a June report that the provisional number of births in the U.S. for 2022 was just over 3.6 million, a decline from the previous year. The fertility rate was 56.1 per 1,000 women ages 15-44. This figure is roughly half of what the rate was in the 1960s and more or less on par with the rate in 2020, which was the lowest rate on record.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times noted in 2018 that one of the key drivers behind Americans having fewer or no children is financial insecurity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll conducted by USA Today last year confirmed that was still the case. About 46% of respondents suggested their personal financial situation influenced their planned or current childlessness; 40% indicated work-life balance was at least partly to blame.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Examiner noted that financial struggles hit parents straight out the gate. The national average cost of child delivery in a hospital exceeds $18,000, or $3,000 out of pocket for those with insurance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12-week reprieve that some parents might find as a result of Vance's bill could go a long way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Fairness for Stay-At-Home Parents Act supports mothers' and parents' invaluable role in raising the next generation," said Rubio, the original co-sponsor of Vance's bill. "This legislation stops employers from imposing harsh financial penalties if a parent decides not to return to work after unpaid leave, and it empowers families to make choices that prioritize the well-being of their children."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubio, like Vance, appears keen on bolstering the family. Following the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling, Rubio released a pro-family framework, stressing the "need to adopt pro-life policies that support families, rather than destroy them."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the proposals in the Florida senator's framework were an expansion to the child tax credit; an allowance for new parents to pull forward up to three months of their Social Security benefits to finance paid parental leave; tax relief for adoptive parents; expanded support for pro-life crisis pregnancy centers; and the establishment of a grant program funding integrated mentoring services for poor mothers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the Manhattan Institute's Brian Riedl prophesied to the Washington Post that Republicans would likely take a stronger lead on bolstering the family beyond just sparing the unborn from mass extermination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I could see if Republicans decide that abortion politics are working against them, there could be a push for child-care benefits, more maternal health care, and better adoption services to make it easy and more affordable for more mothers to carry the babies to term," said Riedl. "It would put their money where their mouth is when challenged on making it easier for mothers to afford their children and get their health care."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONOR MCGREGOR WON&rsquo;T FACE CHARGES AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT DURING NBA FINALS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conor McGregor won&rsquo;t face charges stemming from allegations he sexually assaulted a woman during the NBA Finals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGregor was accused by a woman of sexually assaulting her in the bathroom of Kaseya Center during a Heat/Nuggets NBA Finals game, and the UFC star always maintained he didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors have now decided there is &ldquo;insufficient evidence&rdquo; to pursue the situation further, according to TMZ. Authorities also cited &ldquo;contradicting and/or no corroborating witnesses&rdquo; as another reason for why no charges will be brought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In light of the above facts and circumstances, the State would not be able to satisfy its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,&rdquo; prosecutors wrote in a closeout memo, according to the same TMZ report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman initially claimed security separated her from her friends to get her in a bathroom with McGregor, but video of the situation told a very different story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was filmed entering the bathroom with McGregor on her own freewill, and nobody was forcing her to go anywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TMZ also reported she was seen at a club with McGregor AFTER they left the bathroom together where she alleged she was assaulted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An attendant outside the bathroom told authorities they &ldquo;did not hear any signs of distress or sounds that would corroborate that whatever was occurring was not consensual.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGregor&rsquo;s attorney told TMZ, &ldquo;After a thorough investigation, including a review of videos and interviews with eyewitnesses, the authorities have concluded that there is no case to pursue against my client, Conor McGregor. On behalf of my client, his family and his fans we are pleased this is now over.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation is now behind McGregor, and that means he can focus on getting back in the octagon.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Israel Mobilizes 100,000 Troops for Gaza Incursion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be the worst intelligence failure since the 1973 Yom Kippur War, a conflict that almost destroyed Israel after a surprise attack from Syria and Egypt. Israel was on the brink as Syrian forces reclaimed the Golan Heights, and it was by sheer luck that this invading force didn&rsquo;t move further to capture the key bridges along the Jordan River. Israel&rsquo;s heartland would&rsquo;ve been wide open. The game could&rsquo;ve been over, so Israel continues to respond forcefully against incursion by terrorists and its Arab neighbors since it&rsquo;s a nation with no strategic depth. How Jerusalem was caught sleeping amid this latest assault by Hamas on October 7 must be investigated since Shin Bet and Mossad are some of the most capable agencies in the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This attack occurred on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, and like that last war, the assault began during a Jewish holiday. Hamas launched thousands of rockets as cover for a land, sea, and air assault that could only have been made possible with outside help, considering its sophisticated nature. Iran has admitted they helped plan the assault.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll has risen to 700, with reports of kidnappings, rapes, and murder of Israeli citizens caught in the fighting. Hamas operatives paraglided into Southern Israel, with other terrorists attacking over two dozen areas along the Gaza border. Some Americans were also kidnapped and murdered by these terrorists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The footprint from Hamas was around 1,000 terrorists who stormed the infiltrated Israeli territory. Border Police and other forces are still fighting to restore order to the security situation in the area, but tanks and troops are being mobilized for a ground assault. Around 100,000 Israeli troops are ready to go into Gaza, with more reservists expected to be called up as Israel expects this to erupt into a multi-front war. Hezbollah has already launched rocket and mortar attacks in the northern Israel (via Associated Press):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 24 hours after Hamas launched its unprecedented incursion out of Gaza, Israeli forces were still battling with militants holed up in several locations Monday morning. At least 700 people have reportedly been killed in Israel &mdash; a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades &mdash; and more than 400 have been killed in Gaza.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel said it brought in special forces to try to wrest control of four sites from Hamas fighters, including two points that militants entered earlier in their attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed to have taken captive more than 130 people from inside Israel and brought them into Gaza, saying they would be traded for the release of thousands of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The announcement, though unconfirmed, was the first sign of the scope of abductions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The captives are known to include soldiers and civilians, including women, children and older adults &mdash; mostly Israelis but also some people of other nationalities. The Israeli military said only that the number of captives is &ldquo;significant.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many as 1,000 Hamas fighters were involved in Saturday morning&rsquo;s assault, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, speaking on ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Week.&rdquo; The high figure underscored the extent of planning by the militant group ruling Gaza, which has said it launched the attack in response to mounting Palestinian suffering under Israel&rsquo;s occupation and blockade of Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In northern Israel, a brief exchange of strikes with Lebanon&rsquo;s Hezbollah militant group fanned fears that the fighting could expand into a wider regional war. Hezbollah fired rockets and shells Sunday at Israeli positions in a disputed area along the border, and Israel fired back using armed drones. The Israeli military said the situation was calm after the exchange.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israelis were still reeling from the breadth, ferocity and surprise of the Hamas assault. The group&rsquo;s fighters broke through Israel&rsquo;s security fence surrounding the Gaza Strip early Saturday. Using motorcycles and pickup trucks, even paragliders and speedboats on the coast, they moved into nearby Israeli communities &mdash; as many as 22 locations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://themessenger.com/news/hamas-threatens-to-start-executing-hostages-if-gaza-strikes-continue"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://themessenger.com/news/hamas-threatens-to-start-executing-hostages-if-gaza-strikes-continue</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hamas Threatens to Start Executing Hostages If Gaza Strikes Continue</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamas on Monday threatened to execute Israeli hostages being held in Gaza if Israel continues to conduct airstrikes without warning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Any targeting of innocent civilians without warning will be met regretfully by executing one of the captives in our custody, and we will be forced to broadcast this execution,&rdquo; Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas&rsquo; Qassam Brigades, said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamas has claimed to be holding more than 100 Israelis prisoner in the Gaza Strip, according to the Qatar-based network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warning from Hamas came as Israeli Defense Forces intensified a bombardment of Gaza as dusk fell on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Images shown live on CNN showed heavy rocket fire lighting up the sky above Gaza, a Palestinian enclave about the size of Omaha, Nebraska, that's home to some two million people and considered one of the most densely populated places in the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are reports that American citizens are among those being held captive in Gaza. The State Dept. said it was working to confirm those reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/christian-baker-faces-new-lawsuit-over-gender-transition-cake-after-supreme-court"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/christian-baker-faces-new-lawsuit-over-gender-transition-cake-after-supreme-court</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christian baker faces new lawsuit over gender-transition cake after Supreme Court</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Colorado Supreme Court agreed to hear the case against Christian cake baker Jack Phillips, which he says is the "light at the end of the tunnel" after more than 11 years in court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado, declined to create a custom cake for a same-sex wedding in a move that sparked a 2012 lawsuit that ultimately landed him at the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2018, the nine justices ruled that the state of Colorado was hostile to Phillip&rsquo;s religious beliefs and that the government can&rsquo;t force anyone to create custom works of art that communicate a message.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in 2018, Phillips faced a second lawsuit, this time from a transgender lawyer who requested a cake celebrating a gender transition. When Phillips declined, he was back in court on grounds that he discriminated against the lawyer. The Colorado Supreme Court just agreed to hear his case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I hope it is the light at the end of the tunnel. I&rsquo;m pretty excited about it," Phillips told Fox News Digital in an interview. "The state court turned us down in our first case, but I think they realize now that I serve everybody."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This case is not who I serve, but it&rsquo;s always the what I&rsquo;m going to create not the who that&rsquo;s asking for it. And I hope they get that right this time," said Phillips.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake Warner, attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) defending Phillips, said that the lawsuit from the beginning was "clearly a set-up" with the intent of "targeting" Phillips and his beliefs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Autumn Scardina, who identifies as transgender, asked Phillips to make a cake celebrating a gender transition &ndash; pink on the inside, blue on the outside. When Phillips declined, Scardina asked for a cake depicting Satan smoking a marijuana joint &ndash; which Phillips also declined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the trial phase, "Scardina promised Phillips that, were this suit dismissed, Scardina would call Phillips the next day to request another cake and start another lawsuit," legal documents state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being in court for more than a decade, "numerous threatening emails" and death threats, Phillips says the case has helped to "strengthen" his faith.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We just celebrated our 30th anniversary of being in business Labor Day weekend. And so for 30 years we&rsquo;ve served everybody who&rsquo;s come into our shop," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"But this whole legal battle has helped strengthen my faith in Jesus Christ and strengthen our family, brought us all closer together. It&rsquo;s brought together a lot of people who have helped support us in so many ways."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips mentioned that a gay man testified on his behalf in court "because he understood that I serve everybody, gladly served him, but he knows that I couldn&rsquo;t create every cake that people would ask me for."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s been an encouraging time to see people stand beside us like that," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to this latest challenge, Phillips said Scardina is "not the enemy" and that he has "nothing to forgive."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This person isn&rsquo;t fighting against me, this case is against the state and my right to express my religious freedom and do so without fear of punishment in the marketplace," said Phillips.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oral arguments for the case have yet to be set but likely will be scheduled for the springtime next year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF will argue that because of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling in Phillip&rsquo;s previous case and the latest ruling in 303 Creative vs. Elenis involving a website designer, which determined that the government can&rsquo;t compel an artist to speak a message with which they disagree, that the law is on Phillips&rsquo; side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What's critical now after 303 is the fact that this cake actually does communicate a message. The trial court found that this cake symbolizes the transition from male to female and went into great detail about the symbolism of the cake. The court found that blue represents male and pink represents female and that this cake communicates a message given the context of how cake artists are often asked to create custom cakes," Warner said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In light of 303 Creative, the Colorado Supreme Court should reverse the decision below and affirm Jack's right to speak consistently with his beliefs. He shouldn't be punished for declining to create a custom cake promoting a message that goes against his beliefs," Warner added.</span></p>

<p><strong>US Gives More Than $4.1 Billion in Grants for LGBT and Transgender Initiatives Worldwide</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the past three fiscal years, $4.1 billion in federal money from taxpayers has been flowing to LGBT initiatives in the United States and around the world, an Epoch Times investigation has revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Oct. 1, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2023, the U.S. government issued more than 1,100 grants to fund LGBT-promoting projects around the world, according to the Epoch Times review of a federal spending website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scope of projects varies widely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans to create a "safe space for LGBTQ youth and adults to seek support and resources" earned a $1.8 million grant from the U.S. government in 2022 for the LGBT Life Center in Norfolk, Virginia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal for encouraging "diversity, equity, and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities by promoting economic empowerment of and opportunity for LGBTQI+ people in Serbia" also was a winning plan. To fund it, the U.S. government awarded a Serbian activist group a grant of $500,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Armenian activist group, the Pink Human Rights Defender, received $1 million from the United States "to empower the LGBTI community" in Armenia, a tiny country next to Turkey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal spending website can be filtered to show entries that include specific keywords. A list of payouts filtered by using the keyword "LGBT" included 1,181 grants, 31 loans, and nine direct payments during the past three fiscal years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, during the past fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government issued 454,821 grants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government grants provide free money for specific purposes. Federal loans can be repaid over long periods of time at low interest rates. Direct payments from the government give money to groups&mdash;they may be unrestricted, or for a specific use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of grants connected to the keyword "LGBT," individual payouts of at least $1 million totaled more than $3.7 billion combined. Many additional smaller grants also were awarded for LGBT initiatives but were not reviewed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the list was filtered for grants including the word "transgender," 574 were listed. In that category, grants that paid out at least $1 million totaled nearly $478 million. Seven direct payments and nine loans with the keyword "transgender" also were issued by the U.S. government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet money flows to these projects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) gave $1.2 million to "LGBTQIA+ pride centers" in the San Diego Community College District.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another DOE grant of almost $1.6 million was awarded for North Dakota's &ldquo;indigenous, LGBTQIA+, rural and underserved school-based mental health needs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A DOE grant gave $1.4 million to Boston College to study "mechanisms of health promotion in diverse youth through gay-straight alliances."&nbsp; In plain speak, the grant funded the promotion of gay-straight alliance clubs in Massachusetts middle and high schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The federal government thumbs their nose at the American people and continues to push this ideology into our schools,"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They're doing it all over the world."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that - is your news for today&hellip; this has been your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief. Just so y&rsquo;all are aware - this will be the only newsbrief for the next week or so, as I will be out of town for our Fight Laugh Feast Conference at the Ark Encounter - as well as visiting my brother in North Carolina after that&hellip; if you liked the show &hellip;..</span></p>]]></description>
