   <title><![CDATA[China’s Olympic Pride (& Propaganda) / 1st Trip to China (22 Yrs Ago This Week) [China Compass]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the China Compass Podcast on the Fight Laugh Feast Network! I&rsquo;m your host &amp; China travel guide, missionary Ben.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can follow me on X (<a href="http://www.x.com/chinaadventures">@chinaadventures</a>), where I post daily details and reminders to pray for China (<a href="http://www.prayforchina.us">PrayforChina.us</a>)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can also email me with any questions or comments @ bfwesten at gmail dot com, which is my pen name. If you want to learn more about our missions projects or get any one of my books, visit <a href="http://www.praygivego.us">PrayGiveGo.us</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, I'm trying to get back into my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; podcast schedule, as I comment on current events from a Chinese perspective, highlight one particular Chinese province to pray for, and then finish by telling a bunch of stories from my experiences in that particular province.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we start by discussing China's Olympic pride and propaganda, dating back to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and turning to the current medal competition with the United States. Here are the NPR articles that I referenced...</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5068021/olympic-medal-count-paris-gold-silver-bronze-total">https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5068021/olympic-medal-count-paris-gold-silver-bronze-total</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/02/nx-s1-5061584/china-paris-olympic-gold-medal-count">https://www.npr.org/2024/08/02/nx-s1-5061584/china-paris-olympic-gold-medal-count</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next we look in depth at the Chinese province of Jiangxi, which is paired up with Georgia in our Pray for China prayer scheme (<a href="https://prayforchina.us/index.php/georgia/">https://prayforchina.us/index.php/georgia/</a>). Hot, humid, hilly, located in SE China and and only slightly larger than Georgia, Jiangxi was the early hideout (aka, Jiangxi Soviet) of the the Communist guerillas (led by Mao) in the 1920s and 30s, as well as home to the important Lushan Hill Station, which was built by missionaries in the late 19th Century, but served as a de facto southern capital for the Communist Part for many years during Mao's reign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, during story time I talk about turning 19 on the streets of Jiangxi's capital, Nanchang. I share about our encounters with police (and a sheep!) in Yiyang and Lianhua, getting taken for a (yummy) ride in Ji&rsquo;an, oversleeping on a wooden bed, walking circles around Ganzhou, and wading through the Dingnan floods all while "running from the light".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mention on the podcast, get your copy of Borden of Yale (free on Kindle!), who visited northern Jiangxi in the fall of 1904 at the age of just 16, and tells a few stories himself: <a href="http://www.bordenofyale.com">BordenofYale.com</a></span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[China Missionary Killed in Plane Crash & 14 y/o Missionary Arrested in China [China Compass]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m your host &amp; China travel guide, missionary Ben. You can follow me on X <a href="http://x.com/chinaadventures">@chinaadventures</a>, and you can email me with any questions or comments @ bfwesten at gmail dot com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. B.F. Westen is my pen name, btw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn more about our prayer and missionary projects and get any of the books I&rsquo;ve helped to publish, check out the website <a href="http://praygivego.us">www.PrayGiveGo.us</a> for easy access to all of these things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On last week&rsquo;s podcast I shared my extended interview with Evangelina, and her beautiful song reminding us to pray for the persecuted. This week&rsquo;s podcast features a &frac12; hour interview with her brother &ldquo;Jaime&rdquo;, who talks in depth about his arrest and deportation from China in 2011, when he was just 14.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaime is also one of the 10 being sentenced in Nashville. He, along with his sister and another young man, were sentenced on July 30th. Similarly to the other defendants (except for their dad, &ldquo;Uncle Bundo&rdquo;, who was given 6 months in jail), they were let off with a combination of home detention and probation. Here is the update that was posted online this week&hellip;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update: The four defendants today have been given time served (which covers the 21 months of pretrial probation), followed by 90 days of home detention, followed by 3 years of probation.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before my interview with Jaime, I spent some time remembering a brother, a friend, a missionary, who passed away in a plane crash in Canada (Merritt, BC) a few days ago (Sunday evening, July 27th), leaving behind a wife and five kids (from their late teens to mid 20s). For security reasons, I will just share his first name, Geoff. Listen to the podcast for my thoughts on his life and legacy.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>
