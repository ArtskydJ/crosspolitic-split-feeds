   <title><![CDATA[More on the Nashville 10, American Summer Camp in Fujian, and a 4 Hour Email at a Chinese "Wangba" [China Compass]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the China Compass Podcast! I start by sharing some observations from last week's Nashville Sentencing, which took place just after I recorded the interviews with Denny and Uncle Bundo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important thing I mention is Denny's bold declaration to the judge, which you can read here: <a href="https://chinacall.substack.com/p/missionary-arrested-in-nashville">https://chinacall.substack.com/p/missionary-arrested-in-nashville</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">please bookmark Denny's extensive online used bookstore, which is one of the primary ways he supports his family and ministry: <a href="https://www.remnantbooks.org/">https://www.remnantbooks.org/</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my interview with Uncle Bundo, we forgot to encourage everyone to pray for Heather Idoni, one of the Nashville 10 (and a grandmother!) who is already in federal prison due to a similar conviction last year: </span><a href="https://freeheatheridoni.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://freeheatheridoni.com/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CCP is brought to you by Pray for China (<a href="https://prayforchina.us/">https://prayforchina.us/</a>) and today's province is Fujian on China's SE coast (paired up with South Carolina).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a short overview of Fujian, I discuss China's subtle propaganda at a Summer Camp FOR AMERICANS in China, hosted outside of Fujian's capital, Fuzhou: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/07/09/world/politics/xi-young-americans-scripted/">https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/07/09/world/politics/xi-young-americans-scripted/</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I also discuss China's CURRENT war with Taiwan, just miles away (in certain places) from Fujian: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://asiatimes.com/2024/06/chinas-war-with-taiwan-is-already-underway/">https://asiatimes.com/2024/06/chinas-war-with-taiwan-is-already-underway/</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During story time, I tell about meeting a fighting couple (domestic abuse) and an elderly Christian man during the long walk through the old city streets of Fuzhou in 2003. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, I finish by describing my attempt at pronouncing (and finding) "net bar" (wangba) in Fujian 20 years ago, and the time I spent four hours(!) writing an email to my now wife.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[6 Months in Prison for Bible Smuggler, Baby Rescuer [China Compass]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>On this special episode of China Compass. I chat with my good friend "Uncle Bundo" the night before his sentencing in federal court for singing and praying in front of a Nashville abortion clinic.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief introduction, we spend the first segment discussing his experiences during upwards of 30(!) trips to China, including taking Bibles to Chinese believers in the late 1980s (1:28). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, after discussing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Uncle Bundo's </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite Chinese region (16:45), we talk through more stories, including being surrounded by Muslims in the middle of the night and falling and busting his head open in a Tibetan town (also in the middle of the night) with his teenage daughter driving the getaway-car-turned-ambulance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(BTW, <a href="https://www.asiaharvest.org/asia-bible-fund">AsiaHarvest.org</a> is the best way to send Bibles to China today. Also, v</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">isit <a href="http://prayforchina.us">PrayforChina.us</a> to learn how to pray strategically for all of China.and follow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="http://x.com/chinaadventures">@chinaadventures</a> on X for daily China prayer updates)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We finish with Uncle Bundo sharing how you can be praying for him as he faces sentencing in Nashville&nbsp; (41:15), followed by one last story about driving a retired police van turned Bible-delivery-vehicle all over the mountains of western China with his teenage kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he wants to keep his identity a secret, in hopes to return to China again one day, he does want to encourage everyone to pray for Heather Idoni, one of the Nashville 10 (and a grandmother!) who is already in federal prison due to a similar conviction earlier this year:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://freeheatheridoni.com/">https://freeheatheridoni.com/</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Uncle Bundo was sentenced on July 3rd (the day AFTER this podcast was recorded) to 6 months in Federal Prison, followed by 6 months house arrest and three years of probation. The prison sentence won't start until at least October, possibly later depending on appeals.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[Denny Deported from China (Multiple Times), Sentenced in Nashville [China Compass]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today on the China Compass Podcast I interviewed my good friend and China co-laborer Denny (aka, William Ekvall Simpson) the day before his sentencing in federal court on July 3, 2024, for singing and praying in front of a Nashville abortion clinic back in 2021.</strong></p>
<p>We spend most of our time discussing our evangelistic adventures in China (7:18), including stories of being chased in the middle of the night with his teenage son and multiple arrests by the Commies (with his teenage daughters).</p>
<p>We also discuss Denny's favorite Chinese place (Summer River, Gansu) and missionary martyr (William Ekvall Simpson) who loaned Denny his name for a season so he could get back into China.</p>
<p>*Visit <a href="www.prayforchina.us">PrayforChina.us</a> (@chinaadventures on X) to learn how to pray more strategically for all of China.*</p>
<p>We finish by discussing how to pray for Denny and the ten who were being sentenced in Nashville. (47:21)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thankfully, Denny was NOT given prison time* by the judge, even though he gave wonderfully bold testimony to the truth in his public statement just before she passed sentence:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://chinacall.substack.com/p/missionary-arrested-in-nashville">https://chinacall.substack.com/p/missionary-arrested-in-nashville</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*He was given six months of House Arrest, followed by three years of probation. It is unclear when this will begin, depending on appeals.</span></p>
<p>Please bookmark Denny's extensive online used bookstore, which is one of the primary ways he supports his family and ministry:<span class="cz-color-0">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.remnantbooks.org/">https://www.remnantbooks.org/</a></span></p>
