<p><strong>Bohnet Music Academy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit Bohnetma.com/crosspolitic for more information on how to equip your family to serve God&rsquo;s musical commands. B-O-H-N-E-T MA.com/crosspolitic</span></p>

<p><strong>Trump supporters, counter-protesters clash outside of Fulton County jail ahead of his arrival</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, both supporters and opponents of 2024 GOP frontrunner Donald Trump gathered outside the Fulton County jail in expectation of his arrival to surrender to authorities in the 2020 election case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the afternoon, police had blocked off the road leading up to the jail, as a crowd gathered at the end of the road.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One person was seen standing with a "Donald J Trump did nothing wrong sign," while others flew American flags and wore red MAGA hats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One anti-Trump man wearing a black and white striped jail suit blasted a bullhorn alarm into the ear of a Trump supporter. Three more behind him were dressed as rats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday morning, Trump replaced his lead Georgia lawyer with Steve Sadow, who last represented Atlanta rapper Gunna in the YSL RICO case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump and 18 codefendants have been charged with violation of the Georgia RICO Act, solicitation of violation of oath by public officer, false statements and writings, impersonating a public officer, conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, forgery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit false statements and writings, criminal attempt to commit filing false documents, conspiracy to commit filing false documents, criminal attempt to commit influencing witnesses, influencing witnesses, conspiracy to commit election fraud, conspiracy to commit computer theft, conspiracy to commit computer trespass, conspiracy to commit computer invasion of privacy, conspiracy to defraud the state, and perjury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying with Trump&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2023/08/24/trump-tucker-interview-gets-amazing-number-of-views-n2162988"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2023/08/24/trump-tucker-interview-gets-amazing-number-of-views-n2162988</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Trump Claims Debate Victory, and He Has Some Incredible Numbers to Support the Claim</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican debate was Wednesday night, and some were somewhat disappointed that the debate didn't spend time on the economy, how horrible Joe Biden is, and the weaponization of the government against political opponents and the American people. It seems like the candidates spent more time trying to verbally take on Vivek Ramaswamy than Joe Biden. It was clear that they were concerned about Ramaswamy's numbers when the rest were mainly in single digits,. They were hoping to have that springboard moment off of him. But it seemed that only focused more attention on him, rather than on them. "Vivek" was trending this morning on polls running this morning like the Drudge poll had him polling as the winner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here was perhaps one of the funniest moments of the debate when Ramaswamy came back at Chris Christie</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1694525968021647466"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1694525968021647466</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I think the problem for the folks at the debate was the guy Fox referred to as the "elephant not in the room" --- President Donald Trump. In the Fox debate format, you don't get the chance to expound on your thoughts. You're given a very limited time to make an impression, sometimes in the. midst of being shouted down or attacked by another candidate. Meanwhile, as we reported, Trump was free to speak at length and benefitted from the long-form interview format.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here was a hilarious moment where he eviscerated the abilities of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and speculated that other folks might come forward in the primary because those two were so bad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1694527574955761965"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1694527574955761965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that I found commendable in the Trump interview was that even in the face of four indictments, what was Trump talking about? The concerns about China's movements in our hemisphere, trying to build bases in Cuba, and their influence over the Panama Canal. There was precious little foreign policy in the GOP debate apart from asking about continued funding for Ukraine, which most seemed to be okay with and Ramaswamy wanted to stop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a strategic understanding that we've seen from Trump in the past for example in trying to warn Germany and NATO about being beholden to Russia for their oil. It's something that Biden completely fails at because he doesn't seem at all concerned about America's security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did any of the candidates at the GOP debate have that springboard moment to shake up the polls and move past Trump? I don't think so. There might be some minor jockeying around, but they faced an almost impossible task to begin with, with Trump so far ahead. How do you gain on him if he isn't even there?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's team released a statement after the debate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"President Trump won this evening's Republican debate in dominating fashion," said the statement attributed to Trump campaign senior adviser Susie Wiles. "More people watched President Trump's interview with Tucker Carlson than the rest of the field on the debate stage combined. Tonight, voters saw a clear contrast between President Trump engaging in a thoughtful policy discussion about what his second term will look like versus 90-second canned sound bites and platitudes from the debate stage."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiles' statement continued: "What is clear after the dust settles: none of the other candidates looked ready to take on Crooked Joe Biden. Only one leader can Make America Great Again, and that's President Donald J. Trump."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this juncture, if winning is determined by attention and eyes on you, then Trump has some receipts for the claim. According to the view count, it's almost 200 million views -- 195+ million at this juncture, after not even a full day.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Maui Survivors on Instructions from Government During Fire: &ldquo;Only Those Who Disobeyed Survived&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents in West Maui faced a barricade that blocked the only paved exit out of town when they attempted to escape the raging wildfires, according to the Associated Press, forcing them to evade the authorities&rsquo; obstacles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents encountered a gridlock caused by several Hawaiian Electric trucks that were replacing telephone poles along the road to Highway 30, and received instructions from electricians to turn back into Lahaina, AP reported. Some died in their cars while others swerved around the barricade or used dirt roads to escape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It made no sense what they were doing,&rdquo; Cole Millington, a resident, said, according to NBC News. &ldquo;They could see the sky was black. They could see the city was on fire. They could see the wind was still whipping everything around. But they were already starting to plant new power poles.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many residents could not escape the traffic and abandoned their cars to jump in the Pacific, making the gridlock even worse, according to The Washington Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The gridlock would have left us there when the firestorm came,&rdquo; Kim Cuevas-Reyes, a resident who drove into the wrong lane to escape, said, according to AP. &ldquo;I would have had to tell my children to jump into the ocean as well and be boiled alive by the flames or we would have just died from smoke inhalation and roasted in the car.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wildfires have burned approximately 2,170 acres in Lahaina, according to CBS News. There have been at least 115 deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaiian Electric did not immediately respond to requests for a comment.</span></p>

<p><strong>US Approves New $500M Arms Sale to Taiwan as Aggression from China Intensifies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has approved a $500 million arms sale to Taiwan as it ramps up military assistance to the island despite fervent objections from China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Department said Wednesday it had signed off on the sale of infrared search tracking systems along with related equipment for advanced F-16 fighter jets. The sale includes the infrared systems as well as test support and equipment, computer software and spare parts, it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the deal is modest in comparison to previous weapons sales, the move is likely to draw fierce criticism from Beijing, which regards self-governing Taiwan as a renegade province and refuses to rule out the use of force to reunify it with the mainland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient&rsquo;s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,&rdquo; the State Department said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The proposed sale will improve the recipient&rsquo;s capability to meet current and future threats by contributing to the recipient&rsquo;s abilities to defend its airspace, provide regional security, and increase interoperability with the United States through its F-16 program," it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement came just hours after Taiwan&rsquo;s President Tsai Ing-wen renewed a pledge to strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s self-defense as she visited a war memorial from the last time Taiwan and China battled. Tsai, visited the outlying islands of Kinmen where the conflict was fought 65 years ago, commemorated those who died.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday's State Department announcement also follows an angry Chinese reaction to the transit through the United States of Taiwanese Vice President William Lai on his way to and from an official visit in Paraguay last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, China has stepped up its military activity in the waters and skies around Taiwan, sending fighter jets and navy vessels near the island or to encircle it.</span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[Identity Politics & Original Sin: An Interview with Dr. Joshua Mitchell [The Pugcast]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today the Pugs are joined by political philosopher, Dr. Joshua Mitchell of Georgetown University. Dr. Mitchell is the author of American Awakening: Identity Politics and Other Afflictions of Our Time. Unlike many thinkers who blame cultural marxism for the slide of the Left into identity politics, Dr. Mitchell believes the true source of the problem is a Christian heresy. The Left has turned doctrines like sin and atonement into a framework for a political program of purgation. Certain groups are scapegoated in the interest of cleaning the stain of social sins such as racism. The problem, of course, is this doesn't truly atone for anything. Our only hope for atonement is found in Christianity. Without a revival of genuine Christian faith the American experiment will end in failure.</p>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, August 23rd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Bohnet Music Academy</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Visit Bohnetma.com/crosspolitic for more information on how to equip your family to serve God&rsquo;s musical commands. B-O-H-N-E-T MA.com/crosspolitic</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden Redistributes Student Loan Debt...Again</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden has again worked with administration officials to redistribute student loan debt belonging to wealthy degree holders to Americans taxpayers, most of whom never went to college.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1693962658775474442"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1693962658775474442</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to Fox Business, the new plan will cost taxpayers $276 billion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The move comes after the administration announced an additional round of bailouts earlier this month and in defiance of a recent Supreme Court ruling on the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Speaking of Biden&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-takes-action-restricting-oil-gas-development-settlement-eco-groups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-takes-action-restricting-oil-gas-development-settlement-eco-groups</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden admin takes action restricting oil, gas development after settlement with eco groups</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Biden administration issued new restrictions on oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico, in an effort to protect a whale species after it settled last month with a coalition of environmental groups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which manages energy development in federal waters, published a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) on Monday evening highlighting expanded protections for the Rice&rsquo;s whale, a species listed under the Endangered Species Act. BOEM was slated to issue the NTL last week, but delayed it until Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"This decision by the Biden Administration does an end-around legal requirements and the public process, imposing unwarranted restrictions on U.S. energy production at a time of continued inflation with prices rising at the pump for consumers," said National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He added that the agreement the administration reached with environmental groups ignores the "best science," contravenes congressional intent under the Inflation Reduction Act and threatens America's energy independence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under the NTL issued Monday, BOEM created a vast new protection zone stretching across the Gulf of Mexico with a variety of new conditions for industry operators. Among its recommendations, BOEM said specially-trained visual observers should be aboard all vessels traversing the area, all ships regardless of size should travel no quicker than 10 knots, and vessels should only travel through the area in the daytime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Those recommendations will be introduced as stipulations to Lease Sale 261, an upcoming offshore oil and gas lease auction. And BOEM removed an estimated 11 million acres of potential oil-rich lease blocks from that lease sale under its actions Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a federal stipulated stay agreement filed late last month, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) agreed to a number of conditions requested by four eco groups led by the Sierra Club which, in response, agreed to temporarily pause litigation in the related case. The case dates back nearly three years when, in October 2020, the environmental coalition sued the NMFS for failing to properly assess the oil industry impacts on endangered and threatened marine wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">They pursued the lawsuit after the NMFS coordinated a multiagency consultation studying the effects all federally regulated oil and gas activities would have on species listed under the Endangered Species Act in the Gulf of Mexico over the next 50 years. The groups argued in the original complaint that the NMFS' biological opinion resulting from its consultation was not based on the best science.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to API, the NTL solely targets oil and gas traffic while refraining from restricting vessel traffic related to other industries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/08/21/covid-mask-mandates-return-to-hollywood-lionsgate-requires-employees-to-mask-up-submit-to-daily-testing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/08/21/covid-mask-mandates-return-to-hollywood-lionsgate-requires-employees-to-mask-up-submit-to-daily-testing/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>COVID Mandates Return to Hollywood: Lionsgate Requires Employees to Mask Up, Submit to Daily Testing</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">COVID mask mandates are returning to Hollywood, with Lionsgate being the first major studio to reinstate masking and daily testing for its Los Angeles office workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Lionsgate is requiring employees who physically work at its headquarters in Santa Monica to wear masks at all times when in the building, effective immediately, except when alone in an enclosed office or large open workspace. In addition, employees are required to submit to daily COVID testing and to report the results to the company, according to an internal memo obtained by Deadline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Employees must wear &ldquo;a medical grade face covering (surgical mask, KN95 or N95) when indoors except when alone in an office with the door closed, actively eating, actively drinking at their desk or workstation, or if they are the only individual present in a large open workspace,&rdquo; the memo reportedly states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has reported a recent uptick in transmissions but &ldquo;overall metrics remain at a low level of concern.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A growing number of colleges and medical institutions throughout the country are also reinstating mask mandates, with the mainstream news media running articles pushing for the return of face coverings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former Obama official and MSNBC medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel said earlier this month on MSNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az-Balart Reports&rdquo; that a rise in COVID cases meant it was time to bring back masks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The return of mask mandates comes as the Biden administration is ramping up another round of COVID hysteria ahead of 2024, pressuring all Americans to get the latest booster this fall. This had led to growing suspicion that Democrats will not only impose mask mandates but bring back mass lockdowns ahead of the next presidential election, in a repeat of 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As Breitbart News reported, the new push for Americans to line up for booster shots follows the revelation in January that health officials want to make coronavirus booster vaccinations an annual event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/the-blind-side-author-michael-lewis-calls-out-michael-oher-amid-lawsuit-against-tuohy-family-that-hes-suspicious-of-them-is-breathtaking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/the-blind-side-author-michael-lewis-calls-out-michael-oher-amid-lawsuit-against-tuohy-family-that-hes-suspicious-of-them-is-breathtaking/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>&lsquo;The Blind Side&rsquo; Author Michael Lewis Calls Out Michael Oher Amid Lawsuit Against Tuohy Family: &ldquo;That He&rsquo;s Suspicious Of Them Is Breathtaking&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The celebrated story of Michael Oher, former NFL athlete and the subject of the best-selling book &ldquo;The Blind Side&rdquo; by Michael Lewis, has taken an insane turn over the past week. Oher has filed a lawsuit against the Tuohy family, claiming they never officially adopted him and accusing them of financial misdeeds related to movie profits. Now, author Lewis has defended the Tuohys and pointed fingers at Hollywood&rsquo;s accounting system as the real culprit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In 2006, Lewis&rsquo;s book spotlighted Oher&rsquo;s heartwarming journey from a troubled youth to an accomplished football player, largely credited to the benevolence and support of Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy. The narrative was later adapted into an award-winning movie in 2009, starring Sandra Bullock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, the harmony of the feel-good story depicted on the big screen seems drastically different from the current situation we&rsquo;re seeing unfold now. Oher&rsquo;s lawsuit alleges that the Tuohys tricked him into signing over the legal authority to use his name in business deals after his 18th birthday, thereby cheating him out of future proceeds. He asserts they profited off the Oscar-winning movie while sidelining him financially.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Responding to these allegations, the Tuohy family labeled Oher&rsquo;s claims a &ldquo;shameful shakedown&rdquo; and voiced intentions to end the conservatorship, a legal concept where an individual is appointed to manage another&rsquo;s financial and/or personal affairs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Adding fuel to the fire, the Tuohy family&rsquo;s attorney, Martin Singer, claims that before initiating the lawsuit, Oher tried to extort the family for $15 million. Singer alleged Oher threatened the Tuohys with negative press unless the hefty amount was handed over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But Michael Lewis, in interviews with both The Washington Post and at a previously recorded Google event, blames Tinsel Town for the mess. Lewis slammed Hollywood studios (the film was produced and distributed by Warner Bros.) for their accounting practices which, according to him, often shortchange those whose real-life stories inspire box office hits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">I &ldquo;Everybody should be mad at the Hollywood studio system,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;Michael Oher should join the writers strike. It&rsquo;s outrageous how Hollywood accounting works, but the money is not in the Tuohys&rsquo; pockets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Lewis further divulged that both he and the Tuohy family made about $350,000 each from the movie after considering taxes and agent fees. Challenging Oher&rsquo;s narrative, Lewis asserted that the Tuohys intended to share movie royalties among family members, including Oher. However, Oher reportedly began declining these royalty checks. In a move showcasing the Tuohy&rsquo;s good faith, Lewis revealed they deposited Oher&rsquo;s share in a trust fund designed for Oher&rsquo;s son.</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, August 22nd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Bohnet Music Academy</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Visit Bohnetma.com/crosspolitic for more information on how to equip your family to serve God&rsquo;s musical commands. B-O-H-N-E-T MA.com/crosspolitic</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2023/08/21/photos-hurricane-hilary-flooding-ravages-southern-california/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2023/08/21/photos-hurricane-hilary-flooding-ravages-southern-california/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hurricane Hilary Flooding Ravages Southern California</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tropical Storm Hilary deluged arid parts of Mexico and then drenched Southern California from the coast to the desert resort city of Palm Springs and inland mountains, forcing rescuers to pull several people from swollen rivers. Even as the storm subsides across the coast, flooding and mudslides were expected across the parts of the southwestern U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The storm first made landfall in Mexico&rsquo;s arid Baja California Peninsula on Sunday in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles (250 kilometers) south of Ensenada. One person drowned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It then moved through mudslide-prone Tijuana, threatening the improvised homes that cling to hillsides just south of the U.S. border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, Hilary dropped more than half an average year&rsquo;s worth of rain on some areas, including Palm Springs, which saw nearly 3.18 inches (8 centimeters) of rain by Sunday evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The National Hurricane Center in Miami downgraded Hilary to a post-tropical storm in its early Monday advisory, and warned that &ldquo;continued life-threatening and locally catastrophic flooding&rdquo; was expected over portions of the southwestern U.S. on Monday. All coastal warnings were discontinued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Forecasters warned of dangerous flash floods across Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, and fire officials rescued 13 people from knee-deep water in a homeless encampment along the rising San Diego River. Meanwhile, rain and debris washed out some roadways and people left their cars stranded in standing water. Crews pumped floodwaters out of the emergency room at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sunday was the wettest day on record in San Diego, with 1.82 inches (4.6 centimeters), the National Weather Service said in a post on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The previous record was on Aug. 17, 1977, when 1.8 inches (4.5 centimeters) post-Hurricane Doreen dumped record rainfall on the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation&rsquo;s second largest school system, said all campuses would be closed on Monday, as did districts across the region. San Diego schools postponed the first day of classes from Monday to Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Palm Springs Police Department said in a statement Sunday that 911 lines were down and that in the event of an emergency to text 911 or reach out to the nearest police or fire station.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The storm was projected to weaken as it continued moving northward over California and into Nevada, but Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said &ldquo;very heavy&rdquo; rain and strong winds are still likely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1693454589591523411"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1693454589591523411</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Southern California got another surprise Sunday afternoon as an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 hit near Ojai, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was felt widely and was followed by smaller aftershocks. There were no immediate reports of major damage or injury, according to a dispatcher with the Ventura County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hilary is just the latest major climate disaster to wreak havoc across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Hawaii&rsquo;s island of Maui is still reeling from a blaze that killed over 100 people and ravaged the historic town of Lahaina, making it the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. Firefighters in Canada are battling that nation&rsquo;s worst fire season on record.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As Hilary bore down on Mexico, one person drowned Saturday in Mugele, on the eastern side of the Baja Peninsula, when a vehicle was swept away by an overflowing stream. Rescue workers saved four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mexican army troops fanned out across the area where some of the worst damage occurred Saturday. Soldiers used bulldozers and dump trucks to help clear tons of boulders and earth that clogged streets and roads. Power lines were toppled in many places, and emergency personnel worked to restore electricity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Sunday morning in California, the warnings from officials didn&rsquo;t keep everyone indoors. In coastal Carlsbad, just north of San Diego, 19-year-old Jack Johnson and his friends kept an eye on the huge waves, determined to surf them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really choppy out there, not really surfable yet, but I think we can find a good break somewhere later,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember a storm like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also Sunday, one of several budding storm systems in the Atlantic Ocean became Tropical Storm Emily, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was far from land, moving west in the open ocean. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Franklin formed in the eastern Caribbean. Tropical storm watches were issued for the southern coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In September 1939, a tropical storm that roared into California ripped apart train tracks, tore houses from their foundations and capsized many boats, killing nearly 100 people on land and at sea</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/wef-adviser-population-collapse-is-good-for-the-planet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/wef-adviser-population-collapse-is-good-for-the-planet/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>WEF Advisor: Population Collapse is &ldquo;Good for the Planet&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Once a &ldquo;right-wing conspiracy,&rdquo; de-population is now being acknowledged by news outlets like The Telegraph.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Prof Harper told the Telegraph:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a good thing that the high-income, high-consuming countries of the world are reducing the number of children that they&rsquo;re having. I&rsquo;m quite positive about that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The WEF professor said declining fertility would help to address the &ldquo;general overconsumption that we have at the moment,&rdquo; which she claims has a negative impact on the planet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The WEF advisor also points out that a population collapse as a result in declines in births will bring about reductions in CO2 emissions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to research, wealthy nations tend to have much larger carbon footprints than poorer countries because they can buy more goods, travel, and do other activities that generate emissions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">World Bank figures show that carbon emissions from high-income countries were 29 times larger than low-income countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In June, U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry declared that 10 billion humans on the planet is &ldquo;unsustainable.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The global population hit eight billion people in November 2022, three times the figure recorded in 1950.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to U.N. projections, the current figure is set to hit 9.7 billion humans on the planet by the middle of the century.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, John Kerry expressed fears about the current population growth, outlining his plans to the AFP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sustainable, personally,&rdquo; Kerry said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We need to figure out how we&rsquo;re going to deal with the issue of sustainability and the numbers of people we&rsquo;re trying to take care of on the planet,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-renew-push-americans-get-covid-19-boosters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-renew-push-americans-get-covid-19-boosters</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden admin to renew push for Americans to get COVID-19 boosters</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Biden's administration is preparing another program to encourage Americans to get booster shots for COVID-19 in the coming months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported an increase in COVID-19 infections across the U.S., though it remains far below levels seen during the pandemic. The Biden administration plans to urge Americans to get booster shots this fall, an administration official told FOX Business' Edward Lawrence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We will be encouraging all Americans to get those boosters in addition to flu shots and RSV shots," the official said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The news comes days after the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) revealed they are tracking another variant of the virus that causes COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The newly discovered variant, referred to as BA.2.86, has been designated as a "variant under monitoring" by the WHO "due to the large number of mutations it carries."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The variant is one of dozens being tracked by national health agencies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The new booster program would come nearly a year after Biden declared the COVID-19 pandemic "over" in September 2022, though he said, "We're still doing a lot of work on it."</span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: The Ninja Upsets Some Ladies (Slugs and Bugs) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Luke has just finished a Ghost Pepper Chicken Sandwich, and the McBabies are pretty noisy in the kitchen! (It's happy sounds, Neighbor Carl.&nbsp; Don't worry.)&nbsp; Some kids need company when they're doing chores, as a reminder to stay focused. But...not Silas.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about Luke's trouble-making ways on social media.&nbsp; He posted a John MacArthur quote: "I couldn't care less what a nonbeliever wants in a church service."&nbsp; Cue the offended Church Ladies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these women aren't busy enough at home, and so they have nothing to "nurse" except a grudge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I thought you were supposed to be LOVING...isn't that what CHRiST would do?!"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow, that sounds like something a Wolf would say.</p>
<p>"Um...Wolves are only religious people. The Bible never refers to unbelievers as wolves."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, that's ALSO something a Wolf would say.</p>
<p>Later: Luke wasn't done offending the Fairer Sex. He said somet things about education to a woman who didn't think he had the right college degree for that sort of truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact the Comedian (and send your hate mail to Luke) by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to our podcast on the Fight Laugh Feast Network!</p>

   <title><![CDATA[What Should We Expect Our Laws to Do? [God, Law, and Liberty]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><br />Every year thousands of pieces of proposed legislation are filed by state legislators across the country, and hundreds become enacted law. Ever thought about what we expect those laws to do based on what the Bible says law does and how God uses law? David offers valuable insight on why the &ldquo;good&rdquo; laws we get enacted seem to do so little good.</p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Friday, August 18th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/mayor-blindsided-after-entire-police-force-resigns-in-minnesota-town"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/mayor-blindsided-after-entire-police-force-resigns-in-minnesota-town</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Mayor &lsquo;Blindsided&rsquo; After Entire Police Force Resigns In Minnesota Town</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Every police officer, including the chief of police, has stepped down from the force in a Minnesota town after they say complaints of low pay and long hours were left unresolved.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Goodhue, a city about 65 miles southeast of Minneapolis with just over 1,000 residents, could be without police officers by August 23. It has struggled to attract new police recruits and give competitive pay to officers. The nonpartisan mayor said she was &ldquo;blindsided&rdquo; by the resignations and promised that the city would be protected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I want to reiterate that we will have police coverage in the city of Goodhue,&rdquo; Mayor Ellen Anderson Buck told Fox 9. &ldquo;That is not an issue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police Chief Josh Smith said the force had trouble getting anyone interested in police work. Smith, another full-time employee, and five part-time employees all announced their resignations last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This has been three weeks now, we have zero applicants, and I have zero prospects,&rdquo; Smith said in July. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve called every PD around for the youngest guys out there, getting into the game. There&rsquo;s nobody getting into the game.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m leaving you guys, because I told you I&rsquo;m in it,&rdquo; he said at a meeting on July 26. &ldquo;But the harsh reality is, I don&rsquo;t want to be the guy working 80 hours a week just running this PD, being on call 24 hours a day, which I already am, and leaving no time for my family.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the Goodhue City Council raised Smith&rsquo;s salary by $13,000 and the other officers by 5% this year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Right now &hellip; trying to hire at $22 an hour, you&rsquo;re never going to see another person again walk through those doors,&rdquo; Smith said, noting that cities could frequently give more benefits and higher pay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After all the officers leave, the town is set to contract with the Goodhue County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to provide law enforcement services. The police department in Morris, another Minnesota town, was disbanded last year after it could not retain staffers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police departments across the U.S. have struggled to attract recruits in urban and rural areas. The shortage of officers comes following a wave of anti-police sentiment after the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody in 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2023/08/16/pakistan-muslim-mob-of-10000-people-burns-down-hundreds-of-christian-homes-churches-over-blasphemy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2023/08/16/pakistan-muslim-mob-of-10000-people-burns-down-hundreds-of-christian-homes-churches-over-blasphemy/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Muslim Mob of 10,000 People Burns Down Hundreds of Christian Homes, Churches, over &lsquo;Blasphemy&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A mob reportedly made of up as many as 10,000 men began burning down, looting, and otherwise violently assaulting Christian communities in Jaranwala, Pakistan, on Wednesday in response to reports that a Christian man had allegedly desecrated a Quran.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Pakistani newspaper Dawn, citing local Christians in the northern Pakistani region of Punjab, documented the burning down or otherwise complete destruction of at least five churches. The British Asian Christian Association, an international aid group that serves persecuted Christians in Pakistan, reported that the mob destroyed over 500 homes and left &ldquo;tens of thousands&rdquo; of Christians homeless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Muslim mob violence in Pakistan, an officially Islamic state, is common. Islamist mobs often riot when rumors spread of a Christian allegedly desecrating a Quran, insulting the Islamic figure Muhammad, or otherwise offending the religion. Islamists have also rioted over international news, such as riots in support of the Charlie Hebdo massacre of 2015 or riots against France following the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, which the French government condemned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Christians are often the targets of such violence and local police rarely intervene effectively, particularly when the mob attacks are triggered by allegations of blasphemy. &ldquo;Blasphemy&rdquo; is a crime in the Pakistani penal code, punishable by death when directed at Muhammad personally. Pakistan has never in its history executed a person for blasphemy, but mobs have &ldquo;extra-judicially&rdquo; killed or severely injured untold numbers over the alleged crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Many of those killed for &ldquo;blasphemy&rdquo; are not charged with the crime and little evidence exists that the blasphemy occurred. Christians in Pakistan are disproportionately poor and some accused of &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; such as writing on a Quran are illiterate, making the accusations impossible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The incidents triggered on Wednesday reportedly began when Muslims in Jaranwala began accusing Saleem Masih, a Christian man believed to work as a cleaner, of desecrating a copy of the Quran, the Islamic holy book. According to the British Asian Christian Association, the violence began when Islamic officials used mosques to make community announcements demanding that mobs organize and begin destroying Christian communities in response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The affected regions, including Cinema Basti, Christian Town, and Esa Nagar, have witnessed the destruction of over 500 houses,&rdquo; the organization detailed. &ldquo;According to reports provided by on-ground volunteers, Pastors Muratib and Moon, a tumultuous mob of approximately 10,000 individuals has wreaked havoc within the Christian towns.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that pastors had confirmed the burning down and looting of at least five churches in the community throughout Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Images on social media showed smoke rising from the church buildings and people setting fire to furniture that had been dragged from them. A Christian cemetery was also vandalised, as well as the local government office,&rdquo; Dawn documented.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Videos from the greater fay-sala-bad area showed large crowds of men starting fires around churches, looting the homes of Christians, and chanting anti-Christian slogans. In one such video, one police officer appears in front of a crowd of what appears to be hundreds of people, calmly attempting to address the men and being ignored as they continue ransacking what appears to be a residential community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bishop Azad Marshall, the president bishop of the Church of Pakistan, posted a message on Twitter on Wednesday stating that churches were burning as he was writing and demanding police take action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The mob attacks appear to be ongoing at press time, though local police claim they are organizing a response. Pakistan&rsquo;s Geo TV cited the information minister for Punjab, Amir Mir, claiming &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of people had been arrested for their participation in the mob attacks and that police believed the eruption of violence was not spontaneous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;There was a plan to disturb the peace by inciting public sentiments. After the desecration of the Holy Quran, the angry protesters reacted strongly,&rdquo; Mir claimed, apparently accepting the alleged blasphemy as a fact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Geo TV added that Mir claimed police were working swiftly to investigate &ldquo;the tragic incident of the desecration of the holy book&rdquo; &ndash; the Quran, presumably, though Mir did not clarify if he was also investigating Bishop Marshall&rsquo;s report of desecrations of Bibles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mir also astoundingly claimed &ldquo;no one was injured nor was there any loss of life&rdquo; in the riots, contradicting the on-the-ground reports from the British Asian Christian Association, which alleged thousands of injuries.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>North Carolina legislature overrides Governor&rsquo;s vetoes on transgender and charter school bills</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The North Carolina House of Representatives and Senate voted along party lines to override several of Governor Roy Cooper&rsquo;s vetoes on Wednesday afternoon. All of the bills that had their vetoes overridden now become law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House and Senate members first voted to override House Bill 574, which is better known as the Fairness in Women&rsquo;s Sports Act. The bill would ban all transgender girls and women (biological boys or men) from competing in women&rsquo;s athletics at the middle school, high school, and college levels in North Carolina. After passing the House, the Senate then overrode the governor&rsquo;s veto as well along party lines..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also on the calendar Wednesday was House Bill 808, a bill that would ban gender-affirming care for children. This bill prohibits doctors in North Carolina from treating any child under 18 years old with drugs associated with gender transitioning. The House overrode the Governor&rsquo;s veto of that bill by a vote of 73-46. The NC Senate then voted to override the veto by a vote of 27-18.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Senate Bill 49, also known as the Parents Bill of Rights or also by the nickname &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Say Gay bill&rdquo; is a bill that would force educators from kindergarten through high school to notify parents if a child asked school personnel to use other pronouns or other names for them. Senate Bill 49&prime;s veto was also overridden in both chambers of the General Assembly Wednesday as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The House and Senate also voted to override House Bill 219, known as the Charter School Omnibus Bill, by a House vote of 74-45 and a Senate vote of 27-18.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Bill 219 allows charter schools in the state to expand without seeking permission as long as they&rsquo;re not considered low-performing. It would also allow them to give preferential treatment to applicants instead of using the lottery system as well as begin to allow enrollment and charge tuition for out-of-state and foreign exchange students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Bill 219 would also allow county governments to use funds collected from property taxes to pay for charter school buildings and other capital projects, under current law using public funds for this reason is not possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both chambers also voted along party lines to override Governor Cooper&rsquo;s veto of HB618 dealing with charter school review boards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">House Bill 488, a bill allowing for Code Council Reorganization and various code amendments was also overridden in both chambers on Wednesday along party lines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Upon adjournment, House Speaker Tim Moore (R - Cleveland County) told members that there would be no legislative votes for the rest of this week or next, and possibly the week beyond that, meaning that the General Assembly will not be taking up a state budget until at least September, well after the start of the new year for North Carolina&rsquo;s public schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/tuohy-family-from-the-blind-side-responds-to-accusations-from-nfl-vet-michael-oher-as-he-seeks-film-royalties/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/tuohy-family-from-the-blind-side-responds-to-accusations-from-nfl-vet-michael-oher-as-he-seeks-film-royalties/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Tuohy Family From &lsquo;The Blind Side&rsquo; Responds To Accusations From NFL Vet Michael Oher As He Seeks Film Royalties</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former NFL player Michael Oher, who was the focus of the 2009 blockbuster film The Blind Side, has filed a lawsuit in a Shelby County, Tennessee court against Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy, the people who took him into their home and raised him as a wayward teenager. Oher accuses them of misleading him intentionally regarding his &lsquo;adoption,&rsquo; which he claims was a conservatorship instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Needless to say, this revelation has completely altered the images of Oher and the Tuohy&rsquo;s portrayed in the popular film, suggesting that this Christian, kind family may have had other motives for taking Oher into their home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Oher, now 37 years old, had his attorney file a 14-page document to the court alleging that as a teenager, the Tuohy&rsquo;s convinced him to sign a document back in 2004 giving them full legal authority over any business decisions he could potentially be involved in, rather than what he believed was an adoption by the family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sean Tuohy said in an interview with The Daily Memphis that the accusations of ill-intent and that his family simply wanted to profit off of Oher were ridiculous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I sat Michael down and told him, &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re planning to go to Ole Miss &mdash; or even considering Ole Miss &mdash; we think you have to be part of the family. This would do that legally,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said at the time when Oher believed they were legally adopting him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We contacted lawyers who had told us that we couldn&rsquo;t adopt over the age of 18; the only thing we could do was to have a conservatorship. We were so concerned it was on the up-and-up that we made sure the biological mother came to court.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tuohy also stated that the family did not earn the sizable amount of money Oher&rsquo;s attorneys believe they did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Touhy, who is already wealthy himself from owning and selling a chain of fast food franchises for upwards of $200 million, claimed that those saying it was all about the money should think again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1691179803821359105"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1691179803821359105</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The lawsuit being brought by Oher, paints a vastly different picture&hellip; if you want more information on that lawsuit, go listen to my newsbrief from yesterday.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Thursday, August 17th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Bohnet Music Academy</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Visit Bohnetma.com/crosspolitic for more information on how to equip your family to serve God&rsquo;s musical commands. B-O-H-N-E-T MA.com/crosspolitic</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/aoc-owed-up-to-50k-student-loans-cancellation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/aoc-owed-up-to-50k-student-loans-cancellation</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>AOC owed up to $50,000 in student loans while leading calls for debt cancellation</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), one of Capitol Hill's leading voices on student loan forgiveness, owes the Department of Education up to $50,000 in student loans, according to the New Yorker's recent financial disclosure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The filing, which was reviewed by the Washington Examiner, documented that the congresswoman owed the department between $15,000 and $50,000 for her student loans as of 2022. That same year, Ocasio-Cortez led the call for the Biden administration to cancel thousands of dollars in loans for each student.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Now would be a great time to cancel student loan debt, take significant climate action, and pass voting rights," Ocasio-Cortez posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, in May 2022 in response to a Marist poll that showed President Joe Biden had a low approval rating among young adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ocasio-Cortez's student loan debt was already known, as the congresswoman's 2021 financial disclosure showed her holding up to $50,000 in liability.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden revealed his student loan forgiveness plan in August 2022 to forgive up to $20,000 worth of student loan debt for borrowers who make under $125,000 a year individually or $250,000 for married couples. Members of Congress earn an annual salary of $174,000. Although Ocasio-Cortez celebrated the plan, she called for more forgiveness for people who owed even more debt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"It was YOUR pushing, YOUR pressure, YOUR organizing that got them to this point," Ocasio-Cortez posted on Instagram. "I am very grateful for this watershed moment of a first step &mdash; it is so encouraging, thrilling, and has already changed SO many people's lives. But I am also thinking about how this still leaves a question mark for those in the highest amounts of debt, who need the most amount of help. So let's celebrate and keep going."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fellow "Squad" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) is among those who owe money, with Tlaib owing more than $100,000 to the Department of Education for her law degree. Tlaib pushed for the Biden administration to forgive at least $50,000 in student loan debt for individual borrowers last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">More Trump news now&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/08/15/morning-consult-poll-trump-boasts-41-point-lead-one-week-ahead-republican-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/08/15/morning-consult-poll-trump-boasts-41-point-lead-one-week-ahead-republican-debate/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trump Boasts 41-Point Lead One Week Ahead of Republican Debate</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former President Donald Trump is boasting a 41-point lead in the Republican primary roughly one week ahead of the first GOP debate, which will take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on August 23.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The survey found Trump maintaining majority support, with 57 percent of potential Republican primary viewers choosing him as their candidate, despite ongoing legal troubles which have not had a negative effect on him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has attempted to revamp his campaign over the last few months &mdash; from laying off dozens of staffers to replacing his campaign manager &mdash; remains in a distant second place, 41 points behind Trump with 16 percent support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Anti-woke businessman Vivek Ramaswamy comes in third place, just seven percent behind DeSantis with nine percent support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former Vice President Mike Pence came in fourth place with seven percent support, followed by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who all saw three percent support. All others listed saw one percent support or less.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That portion of the survey was taken August 11-13, among 3,064 potential Republican primary voters and has a +/- 2 percent margin of error.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Again, the survey shows choices for a second-choice candidate diversifying, as 36 percent of Trump supporters choose DeSantis as their second choice, followed by nearly one-quarter, 23 percent, who chose Ramaswamy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Another 11 percent said Pence, followed by five percent who said Haley and Scott, and 14 percent unsure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Similarly, 37 percent of DeSantis supporters chose Trump as their second-choice candidate, followed by 21 percent who said Ramaswamy, 14 percent who said Pence, 12 percent who said Haley, eight percent who chose Scott, and three percent who remain unsure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The survey coincides with the latest Kaplan Strategies poll, which shows Trump leading with 48 percent support, Ramaswamy moving to second place with 11 percent support, and DeSantis falling to third with ten percent.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden Promises Maui Fire Survivors $700 Per Household &mdash; Less Than What Is Spent on Ukraine</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden announced Monday that survivors of the Maui fires would receive &ldquo;a one-time $700 payment per household,&rdquo; after he faced criticism for telling a reporter he had &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; on the rising death toll.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">His account posted: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re laser-focused on getting aid to survivors, including Critical Needs Assistance: a one-time $700 payment per household offering relief during an unimaginably difficult time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The one-time payment of $700 per household is less than the estimated cost to each American household for the Ukraine War, according to a budget expert at the Heritage Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Richard Stern, director of The Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, calculated that the congressionally-approved aid to Ukraine of $113 billion amounts to roughly $900 per American household.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The formal aid packages alone amount to a staggering $113 billion &mdash; roughly $900 per American household and almost 12 times the spending cuts promised by House leadership in the annual spending bills,&rdquo; Stern said in an email to The Daily Signal, Heritage&rsquo;s news outlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Furthermore, he said the $113 billion would cost more than $300 in interest costs per household over the decade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Thursday, as the Maui fires continued burning, Biden asked Congress for an additional $20 billion more in aid for Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/us-homeless-population-balloons-as-biden-seeks-millions-to-house-illegal-migrants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/us-homeless-population-balloons-as-biden-seeks-millions-to-house-illegal-migrants/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>US Homeless Population Balloons as Biden Seeks Millions to House Illegal Migrants</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The homeless population in the US is rapidly increasing at a record pace as Joe Biden seeks hundreds of millions of American taxpayer money to house illegal migrants across the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to new data published by the Wall Street Journal, over 577,000 Americans are homeless today, representing an 11 percent increase compared to 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The increase &ldquo;would represent by far the biggest recorded increase since the government started tracking comparable numbers in 2007,&rdquo; the Journal notes/</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The next highest increase was a 2.7% jump in 2019, excluding an artificially high increase last year caused by pandemic counting interruptions,&rdquo; the outlet adds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Out of the nearly 600,000 homeless Americans, 150,000 are considered chronically homeless because they have lived on the streets for over a year, with many suffering from mental illness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite the homeless problem, Biden is asking Congress to approve hundreds of millions in American taxpayer dollars for a housing development project for illegal migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As The Daily Fetched reported last week, Biden is asking for more funds as part of a $40 billion emergency funding request to Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The request includes a whopping $2.7 billion for the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s various border efforts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">There are 57,300 migrants in the city, with an estimated 100,000 that will need services by June 2025.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Adams admitted that the massive increase in migrants could cost the city as much as $12 billion over the next three years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As Breitbart noted:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Much of the taxpayer money would end up in the hands of left-wing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have profited immensely from illegal immigration in recent years via federal contracts with DHS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Border crossers and illegal aliens who would get to take advantage of the housing project would likely stay for an extended period of time, as a sample size of DHS data recently found that fewer than 2-in-10 are being placed into deportation proceedings after release into the U.S. interior.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/all-lies-retired-nfl-player-michael-oher-says-biographical-film-the-blind-side-mostly-made-up-was-never-adopted-by-the-tuohys/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/all-lies-retired-nfl-player-michael-oher-says-biographical-film-the-blind-side-mostly-made-up-was-never-adopted-by-the-tuohys/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>All Lies: Retired NFL Player Michael Oher Says Biographical Film &lsquo;The Blind Side&rsquo; Mostly Made Up, Was Never &lsquo;Adopted&rsquo; By The Tuohys</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michael Oher, the retired NFL star depicted in the 2009 film The Blind Side, filed a petition Monday in Shelby County, Tennessee probate court challenging the portrayal of his &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; by the now-famous Tuohy family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the 14-page petition, the Tuohys never formally adopted Oher. Instead, they allegedly had him sign conservatorship documents shortly after he turned 18 in 2004, giving them the authority to make business decisions on his behalf. Oher claims he was unaware of the specifics, believing all along that he had been adopted by the family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Oher accuses the family of also profiting from the popular film about his story, which grossed over $300 million, while he received nothing. Oher stated that the Tuohy&rsquo;s wealth and notoriety &ldquo;would not have existed without him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Since the film came out in 2009, the Tuohys have continued to profit off of Oher using the, as Oher claims, false story to enrich themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Tuohy family did not immediately respond for comment when reached out to by ESPN. Oher&rsquo;s petition seeks an end to the conservatorship, prohibits the Tuohys from using his name and likeness, and demands an accounting of the profits they derived using his story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In previous statements, the Tuohys claimed they shared their movie earnings with Oher. However, the NFL star&rsquo;s trust in the family eroded over time, especially due to the film&rsquo;s portrayal of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The lie of Michael&rsquo;s adoption is one upon which Co-Conservators Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sean Tuohy have enriched themselves at the expense of their Ward, the undersigned Michael Oher,&rdquo; says Oher&rsquo;s official legal filing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Michael Oher discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023, when he learned that the Conservatorship to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact provided him no familial relationship with the Tuohys.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Since at least August of 2004, Conservators have allowed Michael, specifically, and the public, generally, to believe that Conservators adopted Michael and have used that untruth to gain financial advantages for themselves and the foundations which they own or which they exercise control,&rdquo; the petition continues. &ldquo;All monies made in said manner should in all conscience and equity be disgorged and paid over to the said ward, Michael Oher.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Legally, adoption would have made Oher a Tuohy family member with financial autonomy. However, under the conservatorship, the Tuohys had financial control. The petition claims the Tuohys negotiated the movie deal after the 2006 book &ldquo;The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,&rdquo; and received $225,000 each and 2.5% of the film&rsquo;s net proceeds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Blind Side grossed over $300 million and earned significant home video sales. It was nominated for Best Picture, and Sandra Bullock won Best Actress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Oher went on to a very successful NFL career, which includes a Super Bowl victory with the Ravens in the &ldquo;Harbaugh Bowl&rdquo; of 2013, and later played in Super Bowl 50 for the Panthers, covering quarterback Cam Newton&rsquo;s blind side.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trump Ordered to Surrender by August 25 in Georgia Case, Will Have Mugshot Taken</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis gave President Donald Trump and the 18 other defendants who were charged Monday until noon on Aug. 25 to surrender.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ms. Willis announced the surrender date in a press conference on Monday evening after a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury handed down charges against the President. Meanwhile, the district attorney said that a trial would likely take place within the next six months, which would occur in the midst of GOP primary elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Trump and the other Defendants charged in this Indictment refused to accept that Trump lost, and they knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump. That conspiracy contained a common plan and purpose to commit two or more acts of racketeering activity in Fulton County, Georgia, elsewhere in the State of Georgia, and in other states," the indictment says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under the indictment, President Trump and the other defendants are each charged with one count of violating Georgia&rsquo;s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and allegedly engaged in &ldquo;criminal enterprise in Fulton County, Georgia&mdash;and elsewhere&mdash;to accomplish the illegal goal&rdquo; of keeping the President in office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The 18 other individuals listed in the indictment include Rudy Guiliani, John Eastman, Mark Meadows, Kenneth Chesebro, Jeffrey Clark, Jenna Ellis, Ray Stallings Smith III, Robert Cheeley, Michael Roman, David Shafer, Shawn Micah Tresher Still, Stephen Cliffgard Lee, Harrison William Prescott Floyd, Trvian C. Kutti, Sidney Powell, Cathy Latham, Scott Hall, and Misty Hampton.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ms. Willis, in the conference, claimed that the charges against President Trump and the others were not politically motivated. &ldquo;I make decisions in this office based on the facts in the law,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The law is completely nonpartisan. That&rsquo;s how decisions are made in every case to date.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, a statement from the Trump campaign said otherwise, accusing the district attorney of having a partisan animus against him. That statement, meanwhile, accused Ms. Willis of engaging in election interference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It's the fourth time the President has been indicted this year. He's the first President in American history to be indicted on criminal charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He faces a New York state trial in March 2024 involving a hush money payment, and a federal trial beginning in May in Florida for allegedly mishandling federal classified documents. In both cases, Trump pleaded not guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A third indictment, in Washington federal court, accuses him of illegally seeking to overturn his 2020 election defeat. President Trump denies wrongdoing in this case as well, and a trial date has yet to be set.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">So what&rsquo;s next?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After defendants in Georgia are indicted by a grand jury, they are arraigned, which is the formal reading in court of the charges. Defendants are also asked to enter a plea. President Trump's attorney could ask the court to waive the arraignment, and he could enter a plea of not guilty without appearing in court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bail also will be determined. He likely will be released, probably in exchange for a promise to return to face the charges at trial. The President will have his mugshot taken upon being taken into custody, Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat told local media this month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He may try to move it to another part of the state, arguing the jury pool in Fulton County, which President Joe Biden won with about 73 percent of the vote, would be biased against him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The process of selecting a jury could be lengthy, given the passionate views many people have of the President and the amount of time jurors would have to dedicate to the trial. In the ongoing trial in Atlanta of rapper Young Thug, or Jeffery Lamar Williams, jury selection ran for months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Checking back in on Hawaii now&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/maui-residents-claim-people-being-looted-robbed-at-gunpoint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/maui-residents-claim-people-being-looted-robbed-at-gunpoint/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>&lsquo;Utter chaos&rsquo;: Maui residents say they are being looted, &lsquo;robbed at gunpoint&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Some Maui residents say they have been looted and robbed at gunpoint while catastrophic wildfires rage on the island &mdash; leaving them begging for a greater response from authorities as thieves make off with vital supplies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As rescue crews work to deliver necessities such as water, food, and first aid to those in need, locals say some residents have grown so desperate waiting for help that they&rsquo;ve resorted to stealing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">West Maui residents blame the robberies in Lahaina on the fact that they feel abandoned without supplies or answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Jeremy Aganos, who owns the restaurant Coconut Caboose &mdash; one of the few buildings that survived the fires on Front Street in Lahaina &mdash; told KITV it was &ldquo;utter chaos&rdquo; for people trying to find food, water and shelter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An Oregon resident told the outlet that their relative flew into Maui to donate water, food, household items and clothing &mdash; only to be robbed at gunpoint soon after his arrival.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The startling uptick in crime has left residents slamming local leadership for its inaction in the wake of the catastrophic fires, which have become the deadliest in the US in more than a century as nearly 100 people have been reported dead so far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some police presence. There&rsquo;s some small military presence. But at night, people are being robbed at gunpoint,&rdquo; Matt Robb, co-owner of a bar in Lahaina called the Dirty Monkey, told Insider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A mobile refrigerated morgue was rushed to Lahaina on Monday to keep bodies cool as the death toll on Maui hit 96 &mdash; and is only expected to rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Two fires have not yet been completely contained, including the one that reduced Lahaina&rsquo;s neighborhoods to heaps of ash and debris, according to an update from Maui County.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Only 3% of Lahaina &mdash; previously a town of 13,000 &mdash; had been searched.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Maui Police Chief John Pelletier said the fire had been so significant that each recovered body will have to be identified through DNA testing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hawaii officials are urging tourists to avoid traveling to Maui as many hotels are prepared to house evacuees and first responders.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hawaii governor says state is looking to 'acquire land' that was destroyed in fires</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Monday, Hawaiian governor Josh Green announced that his administration was considering acquiring properties in the seaside resort town of Lahaina that had been destroyed by the recent wildfires.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He vowed to prevent foreign buyers from swooping in to exploit the tragedy, suggesting the state was better suited to take control of the land.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I'm already thinking of ways for the state to acquire that land so that we can put it into workforce housing, to put it back into families, or make it open spaces in perpetuity as a memorial to the people who were lost," Green said while standing amongst the rubble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a separate press conference, Green reiterated his committment to ensure the land was protected for residents, and revealed that he had spoken with the Hawaiian attorney general regarding "options to do a moratorium on any sales of properties that have been damaged or destroyed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the Honolulu Civil Beat, over 2,000 structures were destroyed in the fire, three quarters of which were residential.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">From Hawaii to Chicago we go&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2023/08/14/chicago-group-asks-gang-members-not-shoot-people-between-9-00-a-m-9-00-p-m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2023/08/14/chicago-group-asks-gang-members-not-shoot-people-between-9-00-a-m-9-00-p-m/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Chicago Group Asks Gang Members Not to Shoot People Between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Native Sons, a group from Chicago&rsquo;s Rogers Park neighborhood, is asking that gang members pledge to cease fire from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily so no one lives in fear of being shot while going about their day-to-day activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The push for the cease-fire is being called &ldquo;The People&rsquo;s Ordinance,&rdquo; CWBChicago reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Native Sons&rsquo; co-founder, Tatiana Atkins, said:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under this ordinance, we ask that people stop associating with and glorifying &lsquo;shooters,&rsquo; stop glorifying &lsquo;switches,&rsquo; and stop wearing those ski masks everywhere which perpetuates you as some &lsquo;opp.&rsquo; When those who live a certain lifestyle try to hang with &lsquo;regular&rsquo; class citizens, they put everyone at risk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At the end of the day, five-year-olds are being killed by gun violence, 14-year-olds are being killed by gun violence, 78-year-olds are being killed by gun violence, pregnant women are being killed by gun violence, young boys with bright futures are being killed by gun violence, fathers are being killed by gun violence, and this shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Atkins hopes that gang members will adopt the cease-fire and that parents will react by making sure they have their children home and inside as 9:00 p.m. approaches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Breitbart News reported at least 23 people were shot over the weekend in Chicago, three of them fatally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Over 370 people have been killed in Chicago thus far in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now in entertainment news&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Sound of Freedom director teases sequel focusing on Haiti</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During a recent interview with Variety, the writer and director of widely acclaimed independent film Sound of Freedom revealed that a sequel might be in the works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Alejandro Monteverde told the magazine that he has been in discussions about writing a sequel to the smash hit film, which would be focused on child sex trafficking in Haiti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"There's definitely a lot of interest to exploring [the subject] a little deeper, because this is just the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot of interest to kind of explore Haiti, what's happening in Haiti. There's [sequel] talks focusing on Haiti," Monteverde said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Sound of Freedom became the highest-grossing independent film since 2019 following its initial release in July, earning more than $173 million. The film tells the story of a former government agent, Tim Ballard, who started an organization to fight child sex trafficking in Colombia. It stars Jim Caviezel, who plays Ballard as he embarks on a mission to rescue children who have arguably been subjected to the worst of crimes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The film has been dismissed by mainstream media and other left-wing critics as a "conspiracy," however; the Sound of Freedom is based on a true story about Ballard's organization, Operation Underground Railroad, and a real mission where his team saved 55 children and 123 people in total.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Monteverde dispelled misconceptions about the film to Variety and criticized mainstream media for avoiding the film, suspecting that they have done so on purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The origin [of the film] has been avoided, purposely or accidentally, in the media,&rdquo; Monteverde said. &ldquo;The origin will answer a lot of these misconceptions on the film.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The film writer explained that he got the idea for the movie after watching a news segment about child sex trafficking, saying that what he learned "shook my soul because I didn't really believe it [existed]."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I just, in my head, could not put those two pieces together &mdash; an adult and a child," he told Variety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Feeling the need to take action against this atrocity, Monteverde began to write a fictional screenplay called "The Mogul." When the film's producer, Eduardo, had met Tim Ballard, the two decided to change the direction of the film and base it on the true story of Ballard's time working as a former special agent for the Department of Homeland Security, in which he has deployed as an undercover operative for the US Child Sex Tourism Jump Team, Variety reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Monteverde told the reporter that the film had been finished years before QAnon conspiracy theorists sprung into the spotlight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"All I wanted was to present a question about the problem: human trafficking, child trafficking, child sexual exploitation. How bad the problem is. We shot in 2018. In 2019, it was a completely finished film [before QAnon became a phenomenon]," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The director said the negative press surrounding the film was "heartbreaking."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On why the sequel would be focused on Haiti, Monteverde said, "Haiti was a big part of Tim's work. I was very tempted to do Haiti on this film. But I wanted to do an origin story, and it was too much material. I needed to end where I ended."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/native-americans-calls-for-commanders-name-change-to-redskins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/08/14/native-americans-calls-for-commanders-name-change-to-redskins/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Native American group demands Commanders reinstate &lsquo;Redskins&rsquo; name</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The name of the football team playing in Washington D.C. is once again under question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A group called the Native American Guardian&rsquo;s Association (NAGA) is demanding the Washington Commanders change their name back to the Redskins, organizing support for the name reversal with a petition that has gained more than 90,000 signatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We invite all Americans to stand up for the dignity of EVERY AMERICAN under assault in today&rsquo;s increasingly nonsensical culture wars,&rdquo; the petition says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This &lsquo;LINE IN THE SAND&rsquo; moment reinforces undeniable history of the NATIVE AMERICAN assisting the FOUNDING OF AMERICA, with NATIVE AMERICAN principles used by the FOUNDING FATHERS in the US Constitution &ndash; and, EVERY AMERICAN&rsquo;s right to the 1st and 14th Amendment and not to be targets of cancel culture or ESG.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This is not a simple left or right issue for Americans; it reaches across the political spectrum dating back to our Founding Fathers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The letter was addressed to the Commanders&rsquo; leadership group, including new owners Josh Harris and Magic Johnson as well as head coach Ron Rivera.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;As the NFL franchise representing the nation&rsquo;s capital, you have a distinct opportunity to recognize the history and value of the American Indian,&rdquo; the letter continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">NAGA, which is led by a board of Native Americans, is a &ldquo;non-profit organization advocating for increased education about Native Americans, especially in public educational institutions, and greater recognition of Native American Heritage through the high profile venues of sports and other public platforms,&rdquo; according to its website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Disgraced former team owner Dan Snyder changed the organization&rsquo;s name in 2020 after years of pressure, beginning the 2020 and 2021 seasons with the name &ldquo;Washington Football Team&rdquo; before opting for the Commanders moniker prior to the 2022 season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to ESPN, the team could be looking to change its name again following its sale to the ownership group led by Harris, largely in an effort to distance themselves from Synder&rsquo;s disastrous tenure.</span></p>]]></description>
