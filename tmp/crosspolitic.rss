   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief for Tuesday, October 25th, 2022. I hope you and your family had a restful weekend, but now let&rsquo;s take a dive back into the news. Before we do that however&hellip;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Has Only 25 Days of Diesel Supply; Shortage Could Cripple Economy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States is down to 25 days of diesel supply as a top White House official declared the stockpile levels to be &ldquo;unacceptably low.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data provided by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) show that diesel stockpiles are at their lowest level for October in records that date back to 1993, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. EIA data show that the United States, as of Oct. 14, has 25.4 days of supply&mdash;down from 34.2 days of supply four weeks prior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, a top adviser to President Joe Biden, told Bloomberg News last week that current diesel levels are &ldquo;unacceptably&rdquo; low and that &ldquo;all options are on the table&rdquo; to increase supplies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diesel crunch comes just over two weeks before the November 2022 midterm elections and will likely drive up prices even more. Diesel is the fuel used by freight trains and commonly used by long-haul truckers to transport goods and food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices, meanwhile, remain relatively elevated, according to AAA data. The average price for a gallon of diesel stands at around $5.33 nationwide, or up nearly $2 since the same time in 2021, the data shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale diesel prices at the New York spot market spiked last week to more than $200 per barrel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes as the Biden administration recently announced it would release another 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, part of the 180 million Biden authorized in March, that Republicans say is a bid to keep Democrats politically afloat ahead of the midterms. But Biden and his allies say that it&rsquo;s not a political tactic, and the administration says it will refill the reserve when prices drop to $67&ndash;$72 per barrel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-on-his-fitness-for-office-i-could-drop-dead-tomorrow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-on-his-fitness-for-office-i-could-drop-dead-tomorrow</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden On His Fitness For Office: &lsquo;I Could Drop Dead Tomorrow&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden (D) responded to questions about his age and fitness for office during an interview that aired Sunday morning by saying that he could &ldquo;drop dead tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden made the remarks during an MSNBC interview with Jonathan Capehart when he was asked what he would say to convince voters to stick with him if he were to run again in 2024.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU to Gift $18 Billion to Ukraine Next Year, the Rest Will Come From U.S</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke after the 27 national EU leaders discussed supporting Ukraine during the second day of their summit in Brussels on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the EU has so far sent $19 billion to Ukraine this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Von der Leyen said the EU would finance 1.5 billion euros per month, with the rest expected to come from the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a video link, Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the EU leaders saying Russian missiles and Iranian drones have damaged a third of Ukraine&rsquo;s energy infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Von der Leyen said the EU was looking to help Ukraine re-establish water, power and electricity supplies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelensky asked the EU for air and missile defence systems and called for &ldquo;new powerful&rdquo; sanctions on Russia and Iran for supplying drones in Moscow&rsquo;s war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland and the three Baltic states proposed banning diamond imports from Russia and phasing out the steel trade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Hungary opposed sanctions against Russia, while Germany and France have said current measures already go far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelensky appealed for more aid pledges to be made at an international conference in Berlin next Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Council President Charles Michel, the summit&rsquo;s chairman, said the EU was looking at using Russian assets frozen under sanctions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that seizing assets amounted to some 300 billion euros, while Berlin and others have warned it might be illegal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kallas also sided with Lithuania for a possible international tribunal to judge possible war crimes committed in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ex-minneapolis-police-officer-kueng-pleads-guilty-george-floyd-killing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/ex-minneapolis-police-officer-kueng-pleads-guilty-george-floyd-killing</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ex-Minneapolis police officer Kueng pleads guilty in George Floyd killing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Minneapolis police officer pleaded guilty on Monday to aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in the May 2020 killing of George Floyd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alexander Kueng&rsquo;s guilty plea will allow one count of aiding and abetting second-degree murder to be dismissed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kueng had helped to restrain Floyd, who was handcuffed and knelt on his back during the May 25, 2020, killing that was recorded on video.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is the second officer to plead guilty to the state charge. Thomas Lane earlier pleaded guilty to the same count. Their former colleague, Tou Thao, is still scheduled to face trial this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three have already been convicted on federal counts of willfully violating the civil rights of Floyd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lane was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in the federal case. Kueng was sentenced to three years and Thao was sentenced to 3 1/2 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officer Derek Chauvin has already been convicted of state murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd&rsquo;s killing last year and is currently serving 22 1/2 years in the state case. Chauvin had pinned Floyd to the ground with a knee on Floyd&rsquo;s neck as he repeatedly said he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State sentencing guidelines for a person with no criminal record, like Kueng, call for a range from about 3 1/2 years to four years and nine months in prison for second-degree unintentional manslaughter. The presumptive sentence is four years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Kueng had been convicted of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, he would have faced a presumptive 12 1/2 years in prison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSNBC host Tiffany Cross attacked minority Republican candidates Saturday morning, claiming they were &ldquo;not voices of color.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross previously hosted Elie Mystal, who attacked Republican senatorial candidate Herschel Walker of Georgia as &ldquo;a person who lacks independent thoughts,&rdquo; on July 30.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Teen Pleads Guilty in School Shooting That Killed 4 Students</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Michigan teenager on Monday pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism charges in a mass shooting at a high school last year that killed four of his classmates and wounded more than half a dozen other people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethan Crumbley, 16, is accused of opening fire at Oxford High School outside Detroit on Nov. 30 with a handgun that his father purchased for him as a Christmas gift days before the massacre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two boys, aged 17 and 16, and two girls, aged 17 and 14, were killed while six other students and a teacher were wounded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley, who was a 15-year-old at the time of the shooting, pleaded guilty in Oakland County Circuit Court to a total of 24 charges, including one count of terrorism causing death and four counts of first-degree murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also charged with seven counts of assault with intent to murder and 12 counts of possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He faces life without parole when he is sentenced. A tentative sentencing hearing is scheduled for Feb. 9, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley&rsquo;s lawyers on Monday withdrew an insanity defense notice that they had previously filed with the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley&rsquo;s parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, also face involuntary manslaughter charges connected to the shooting. In that case, Rochester District Court Judge Julie Nicholson said evidence showed they had purchased a gun for their son despite signs that he was a &ldquo;troubled young man.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case appears to be the first in the United States in which the parents of a teenage school shooter have been charged with crimes attributed to their child. They have pleaded not guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four days before the shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.</span></p>

<p><strong>New Saint Andrews:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&rsquo;s culture shifts like sand. But New Saint Andrews College is established on Christ, the immovable rock. It is a premier institution that forges evangelical leaders who don&rsquo;t fear or hate the world. Guided by God&rsquo;s Word, they take the world back because they&rsquo;re equipped with the genius of classical liberal arts and God-honoring wisdom, thanks to a faculty dedicated to academic rigor and to God&rsquo;s kingdom.Find out more, at nsa.edu/</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneil Dariush drops Mateusz Gamrot late, secures unanimous decision victory</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneil Dariush continued his winning ways at UFC 280 while vanquishing Mateusz Gamrot, who had quickly become one of the most talked about lightweights in the promotion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showcasing incredible takedown defense combined with a punishing style on the feet, Dariush never slowed down over all rounds as he continued to hammer Gamrot with strikes. Late in the third round, Dariush clubbed Gamrot with a huge overhand left that helped him secure the victory as he notched his eighth victory in a row in arguably the toughest division in the sport.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defining strike came with just over a minute remaining as Dariush leveled Gamrot with a huge overhand left. Gamrot dropped to the ground before diving for another takedown to stave off a potential finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the knockdown was the biggest strike in the fight as Dariush put on another stellar showcase while competing against a less established product in Gamrot. With the win, Dariush moves that much closer to title contention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one of the best parts for me came in Dariush&rsquo;s post fight interview.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7q0-Ypk7_HE"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Beneil Dariush Octagon Interview | UFC 280&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/7q0-Ypk7_HE&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Beneil Dariush Octagon Interview | UFC 280</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play 0:00-1:10</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I want to praise Dariush here, is because he&rsquo;s praising Jesus Christ in an area of the world where Islam is the dominant religion currently. Eventually it won&rsquo;t be, but for the time being, this was a bold statement in the United Emirates.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/hunter-bidens-laptop-documents-at-least-459-legal-violations-watchdog-group-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/hunter-bidens-laptop-documents-at-least-459-legal-violations-watchdog-group-says</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter Biden&rsquo;s Laptop Documents At Least 459 Legal Violations, Watchdog Group Says</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year-long exploration of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop has yielded a 630-page report that its authors say document 459 violations of state and federal laws and regulations by President Joe Biden&rsquo;s son and his business partners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marco Polo, a nonprofit formed by a one-time aide to former President Trump to enable a team&nbsp; to take a deep dive into the laptop that the&nbsp; crack-addled Biden left at a Delaware repair store, claims the report is a road map for local, state, or federal prosecutors to pursue charges. The group also sent its report to each member of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timing of the report&rsquo;s release, coming two weeks before the midterm elections, has a certain symmetry to the laptop&rsquo;s initial introduction to the public. In 2020, days before the election, the New York Post published news of the laptop&rsquo;s existence, as well as bombshells from it, but social media suppressed the story after the FBI had warned companies of so-called misinformation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time around, the timing is similar, but other factors are reversed. Legacy outlets have acknowledged that the laptop&rsquo;s files are authentic, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey admitted that censoring the laptop was a mistake, and the social media platform is being sold to free-speech advocate Elon Musk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, which reviewed the laptop&rsquo;s emails, videos, calendar items, photographs, phone records, financial documents and more, but also provided context and explanation, serves as a &ldquo;Rosetta Stone of white- and blue-collar crime under the patina of &lsquo;the Delaware Way,&rsquo;&rdquo; the report says. &ldquo;We were able to illuminate previously convoluted network webs of the people leading the charge for global governance,&rdquo; cutting through shell companies and middlemen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimes Hunter Biden allegedly committed include serving as an agent for foreign entities without disclosing it, tax fraud, and falsifying business documents. The alleged crimes also include prostitution, non-consensual pornography, and distribution of narcotics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/voters-agree-gop-to-take-house-senate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/voters-agree-gop-to-take-house-senate</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters agree: GOP to take House and Senate</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weeks of reporting that the Republicans are poised to take control of the House, and maybe the Senate, have sunk with voters who now mostly agree that the November elections should show Democrats the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest Rasmussen Reports survey, just shared with Secrets, likely voters expect the Republicans to win control of the House. And it&rsquo;s not even close, with 67% agreeing to 17% who don&rsquo;t. Even 56% of Democrats expect their party to lose control of the House.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Senate, it's closer, with 58% of likely voters believing it&rsquo;s likely the Republicans will edge out the Democrats. Just 25% don&rsquo;t agree. Among Democrats, the split is even, 42% agree and 42% don&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the media have recently raised expectations that the House will turn red by 10-40 seats. There has been some reporting of tightening Senate races that could give the Republicans a 1-2 seat edge after the elections are over on Nov. 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also quizzed likely voters on if they plan to cast ballots early or on Election Day. Most, by a 53%-44% margin, chose Election Day, though that was mostly a GOP preference as with past elections.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former FBI Official Will Testify About White House Pressure to Inflate Domestic Extremism Numbers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee announced on Thursday that they would be calling a former top FBI official to testify before Congress to address claims that the Biden administration pressured agents to label cases as domestic extremism or a white supremacist threat even if they did not meet that criteria in order to match Joe Biden&rsquo;s rhetoric.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, current and former FBI agents came forward claiming the Biden administration has been deliberately exaggerating the danger posed by white supremacists. According to the whistleblowers, high-ranking FBI officials were pressuring field agents to fabricate domestic terrorism cases and label people as white supremacists in order to &ldquo;meet internal metrics.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The demand for white supremacy&rdquo; coming from FBI brass &ldquo;vastly outstrips the supply of white supremacy,&rdquo; one agent told the Washington Times. &ldquo;We have more people assigned to investigate white supremacists than we can actually find.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 2, members of the House Judiciary Committee will interview Jill Sanborn, a former assistant director of the FBI Counterterrorism Division and executive assistant director of its National Security Branch, who has been accused of pressuring agents to reclassify cases per the White House&rsquo;s requests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI claims it only investigates those &ldquo;who commit or intend to commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security&rdquo; and that it does not target individuals or organizations based on their political beliefs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the administration previously came under fire for using the resources of the Department of Justice to target angry parents at school board meetings and treat them like domestic terrorists. Merrick Garland authorized the FBI to investigate parents who protested school board meetings alleging a &ldquo;disturbing trend&rdquo; of teachers being threatened or harassed. However, PJ Media&rsquo;s Megan Fox looked into those allegations and concluded that they&rsquo;re mostly bunk.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepoliticalinsider.com/arizona-refuses-to-comply-with-biden-demand-to-remove-makeshift-border-wall/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepoliticalinsider.com/arizona-refuses-to-comply-with-biden-demand-to-remove-makeshift-border-wall/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona Refuses to Comply With Biden Demand to Remove Makeshift Border Wall</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona&rsquo;s Department of Emergency and Military Affairs is refusing a demand by the Biden administration to remove the shipping containers they are using to close gaps in the wall at the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A letter written to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and signed by Allen Clark, Director of Arizona&rsquo;s DEMA, states &ldquo;the containers will remain in place until specific details regarding construction are provided.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark goes on to argue that the residents of Arizona &ldquo;cannot rely on the federal government to ensure its security.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The myriad of federal agencies that claim jurisdiction on the southern border but do nothing to prevent the public nuisance caused by illegal immigration and criminal activity that exploits the open border is quite frustrating to those that live, work and recreate on that border and in our state,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter comes in response to a demand by the Biden administration to remove the shipping containers that are predominantly being used to seal up gaps in the border wall near Yuma.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation penned its own letter last week claiming Arizona&rsquo;s shipping containers are trespassing on its lands and those of the Cocopah Indian Tribe&rsquo;s West Reservation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bureau indicates contracts have been awarded to close the gaps in question and they &lsquo;anticipate&rsquo; awarding more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, they insisted the containers be removed so the project can continue &ldquo;without unnecessary delay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona Republican Governor Doug Ducey issued an executive order to seal up gaps in the border wall in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meaning the White House had no less than 18 months to get those contracts awarded and pushed out to start construction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shipping containers stand 22 feet high, are welded together, and feature an additional four feet of razor wiring added to the top.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ducey&rsquo;s reasoning behind installing the containers includes the Biden administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;lack of urgency on border security,&rdquo; which he labeled a &ldquo;dereliction of duty.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASCAR Suspends Bubba Wallace After Intentionally Wrecking Kyle Larson</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASCAR announced they suspended Bubba Wallace one race for his actions at Las Vegas Motor Speedway where he deliberately retaliated against Kyle Larson on the track.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the South Point 400, Larson had a strong run going into turn 3 and he dove to the inside of both Kevin Harvick and Bubba Wallace. Harvick got out of the gas and let Larson and Wallace race for the position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they continued into turn four, Larson got loose and began to chase his car up the track inching ever close to Wallace. However, he never made contact with Wallace. Coming off the turn, Wallace slammed into the outside wall hard, bounced off it and down into Larson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larson dove to the inside of the track to avoid Wallace. Wallace believing Larson had wronged him by chasing his car up the track chased him down the track and ran into his right rear quarter panel sending both cars spinning up the track. Larson would make contact with Christopher Bell before making contact with the wall. Wallace would smash nose first into the outside wall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASCAR.com reports Wallace violated &ldquo;Sections 4.3A and 4.4 C &amp; E of the NASCAR Member Code of Conduct laid out in the NASCAR Rule Book. Rule 4.4.C lists &ldquo;intentionally wrecking or spinning another vehicle, whether or not that vehicle is removed from Competition as a result&rsquo; as one of five member actions that could result in a penalty.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, NASCAR chose to suspend Wallace one race. NASCAR&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer Steve O&rsquo;Donnell appeared on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio to explain the decision.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NHL Embraces Anti-White Racism, Says They Have Too Many White Employees, Aims To Change That</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Hockey League (NHL) released a workforce demographic study as part of a report on &ldquo;Accelerating Diversity &amp; Inclusion&rdquo; that claims the organization&rsquo;s teams are too white and the league plans to make changes to reduce the percentage of white people that work for them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing the report, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman made clear the organization&rsquo;s goals saying, &ldquo;Our belief is stronger than ever that hockey has a powerful platform to build character, teach life skills, and support our society and our communities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of one of their initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion, the report notes, &ldquo;The NHL developed a new, best-in-class Workforce Demographic Study to understand the diversity of full-time League and Club employees and accelerate inclusive hiring.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Workforce Demographic Study was also highlighted as one of the NHL&rsquo;s 7 Dimensions, specifically under their Employment section. This section specifically notes the NHL is engaging in racist activities, &ldquo;Data from the survey will help guide future decision-making about our workforce. In late 2021, the NHL hired a full-time Director of Recruiting who is focused on attracting diverse talent to the organization. Additionally, the League engaged Jopwell with the intent of creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace by expanding our talent pool through Jopwell&rsquo;s network of Black, Latinx, and Native American professionals.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report further notes they will be excluding white people from a mentorship program, &ldquo;Clubs are also taking action: 22 Clubs have launched or are about to launch a mentorship/fellowship/hiring program to develop BIPOC and female talent to work in the organization&rsquo;s Hockey Operations or front office roles.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC moves to add Covid vaccine to child immunization schedule for federal programs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is set to vote on whether or not to include the Covid vaccine in their recommended schedule of shots for children and teens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to meet on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss, amongst other topics, whether to include the Covid vaccines and other vaccinations into their child and adolescent immunization schedule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to WBOY, the CDC is considering adding the vaccine to their schedule in order for it to be covered under the federally-funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program and other programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for vaccines to be covered under health plans, shots must be approved by the CDC director, and appear on the CDC&rsquo;s immunization schedule, according to a document from the CDC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CDC, VFC is a federally funded program that provides vaccines to children at no cost to families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC&rsquo;s immunization schedule for kids is seen as a recommendation for parents and physicians on when certain vaccines should be administered. The schedule also serves as a building block for school districts nationwide, many of whom chose to follow these guidelines as requirements for children to enter public schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inclusion of the Covid-19 vaccine on this schedule could give the green signal for school districts to enforce mandates on their students, with some schools across the country pausing their mandates over low vaccination numbers in minors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many European nations have said that Covid vaccines are not necessary for children.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/abc-news-investigative-producer-disappears-after-fbi-raid?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/abc-news-investigative-producer-disappears-after-fbi-raid?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC News investigative producer disappears after FBI raid, was working on book about Biden&rsquo;s Afghanistan withdrawal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An award-winning ABC News national security investigative producer has seemingly gone missing following an FBI raid on his home in April for unclear reasons. James Gordon Meek was in the process of writing a book on the Biden administration's controversial withdrawal from Afghanistan when his neighbors spotted armored vehicles outside of his home, and he hasn't been heard from since.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meek, 52, was best known for his breaking news stories on high levels of corruption within the US military. His bombshell report of the Army&rsquo;s coverup of the fratricidal death of Pfc. Dave Sharrett II in Iraq landed Meek a meeting with then-President Obama. He seemed to be at the height of his career, with nine years at ABC, a newly-released documentary on Hulu, and a book on the way. That's why so many are baffled at his mysterious and uncharacteristically abrupt disappearance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was on April 27 of this year when police cruisers and unmarked utility vehicles were spotted blocking the street outside of Meek's Arlington, Virginia apartment building, according to a Rolling Stone report. That was around the time of his last online activity, with one last "like" being sent from his Twitter account on May 2. Since then, he's been silent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An FBI representative confirmed that agents were present that morning "at the 2300 block of Columbia Pike, Arlington, Virginia, conducting court-authorized law-enforcement activity."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The FBI cannot comment further due to an ongoing investigation," they said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal magistrate judge signed off on the search warrant the day before the raid. In accordance with a new policy enacted last year, federal prosecutors are not allowed to seize journalists' documents without approval from the Deputy Attorney General, meaning that Biden-appointed Lisa Monaco had to have given her blessing if that's what the raid was for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the bureau's involvement, Meek has not been charged with any crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anonymous sources claimed to Rolling Stone that federal agents found classified information on Meek's laptop, but the contents of said information are unknown at this time. His lawyer, Eugene Gorokhov, responded to the claims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mr. Meek is unaware of what allegations anonymous sources are making about his possession of classified documents. If such documents exist, as claimed, this would be within the scope of his long career as an investigative journalist covering government wrongdoing. The allegations in your inquiry are troubling for a different reason: they appear to come from a source inside the government. It is highly inappropriate, and illegal, for individuals in the government to leak information about an ongoing investigation. We hope that the DOJ [Department of Justice] promptly investigates the source of this leak."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, no comment on where exactly his client is.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacey Abrams suggests having an abortion as solution to inflation: 'Economic realities of having a child'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was criticized on Wednesday after suggesting that having an abortion could be a solution to high inflation and claiming that "having children" is why people are worried about the price of gas and groceries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1582726622859624449"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1582726622859624449</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:00-1:32</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams made her remarks a day after President Biden pledged that if Democrats keep control of Congress, he will codify in January the federal right to abortion once granted by the recently overturned Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At no point during the speech did the president, who was a freshman senator nearly 50 years ago when Roe v. Wade was decided in January 1973, mention inflation or the economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rejected a New York Times poll that found voters believe the economy and inflation are the top two issues facing the nation, calling it an &ldquo;outlier.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams said at the end of September that there was "no such thing" as a fetal heartbeat at 6-weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepoliticalinsider.com/fake-news-zelenskys-famous-quote-of-need-ammunition-not-a-ride-never-happened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepoliticalinsider.com/fake-news-zelenskys-famous-quote-of-need-ammunition-not-a-ride-never-happened/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fake News: Zelensky&rsquo;s Famous Quote of &lsquo;Need Ammunition, Not a Ride&rsquo; Never Happened</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A senior official claims that a famous quote by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky appears to be fake news, war propaganda.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quote about needing ammunition helped catapult his credentials as a defiant wartime leader.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revelation came amidst a sprawling report by the New Yorker on the Biden administration&rsquo;s support for Ukraine, which is far more extensive than previously known and includes operational planning at the highest levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Zelensky&rsquo;s famous line &ndash; &ldquo;I need ammunition, not a ride&rdquo; &ndash; and the fact that it may have been completely fabricated and promoted by the media ad nauseam casts a further pall on a war narrative that has at times seemed crafted by the heavy hand of a former actor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the New Yorker:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days into the invasion, the Associated Press reported that Zelensky had rejected a U.S. offer to evacuate him from Kyiv, saying, &ldquo;I need ammunition, not a ride.&rdquo; A senior U.S. official said, &ldquo;To the best of my knowledge, that never happened.&rdquo; The official added, &ldquo;But hats off to Zelensky and the people around him. It was a great line.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;re searching for evidence that the American media are perfectly fine with helping to perpetuate falsehoods in the war effort in Ukraine, you need look no further than the Washington Post and fact-checker Glenn Kessler.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kessler analyzed the claim that Zelensky had uttered the quote: &ldquo;I need ammunition, not a ride.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he admitted the claim was not easily verifiable, he concluded using Zelensky&rsquo;s press secretary that &ldquo;the quote, even if not accurate, reflects the moment.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least he tried. The rest of the media simply ran with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn&rsquo;t the first time stories coming out of Ukraine had proven to be completely orchestrated in an effort to drum up emotional support from the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time as the Zelensky &lsquo;ammunition&rsquo; quote, a story was developing about a defiant group of 13 Ukrainian border guards defending Snake Island in the Black Sea who reportedly told a Russian warship to &ldquo;go f*** yourself&rdquo; after being ordered to surrender.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 13 Ukrainian border guards were initially widely reported as killed as the Russian warship opened fire with barreled guns and aircraft bombing Snake Island.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy said during a press briefing that the guards died &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; and even said the 13 would be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was later reported they were still alive and in Russian captivity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, of course, there is the infamous &lsquo;Ghost of Kyiv&lsquo; propaganda promoted by some prominent figures here in the United States. Some, like Rep. Adam Kinzinger, were so willing to believe the story they promoted fake images of a meme-character known as Samuel Hyde.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s breathtaking the number of stories like the Zelensky ammunition fairytale that have been thrust upon the American people as a means to justify the absurd level of financial and military support being offered to Ukraine at our expense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News host Tucker Carlson has seemingly had enough, eviscerating Zelensky for making further outrageous demands for financial aid while the United States economy, and the American people, are suffering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1580717198703611904"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1580717198703611904</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Zelenskyy is now shaking down our cowardly Congress for more cash at the very moment our own economy and our own borders are collapsing,&rdquo; Carlson added.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Since we&rsquo;re getting close to Halloween, Glenn brings the topic of witchcraft to the table today. The guys begin by discussing historic ideas of witchcraft and the witch trials of Renaissance and early modern period. Note that some of these beliefs get us into PG-13 territory. The Pugsters then turn to witchcraft in the modern world, discussing Wicca and witchcraft around the world as well as the growing belief in the supernatural among college students. Although the kinds of witches described in witch hunting manuals only existed in the minds of the people of the day, the guys agree that demonic manifestations are very real even if only obvious in some parts of the world today.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dossier.substack.com/p/the-cdc-will-vote-thursday-to-permanently?utm_source=twitter&amp;sd=pf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dossier.substack.com/p/the-cdc-will-vote-thursday-to-permanently?utm_source=twitter&amp;sd=pf</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC will vote Thursday to permanently shield Pfizer and Moderna from COVID vaccine injury liability</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CDC committee will convene this week and likely vote Thursday to deliver permanent legal indemnity to Pfizer and Moderna, through the process of adding the drug companies&rsquo; mRNA injections to the child and adolescent immunization schedules.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By adding the shots to the childhood schedule, the CDC&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will transfer liability for vaccine injuries to the federal government&rsquo;s National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), allowing for Pfizer and Moderna to finally bring an FDA approved shot to the market without opening itself up to lawsuits. Moreover, it will act as another windfall for companies that have already brought in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues, by requiring these vaccinations for children who attend public schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2020, the federal government invoked the PREP Act, which gave Pfizer and Moderna a tort liability shield due to the declared &ldquo;public health emergency,&rdquo; which the government is reportedly going to revoke in early 2023. The companies&rsquo; emergency use authorization shots have since been protected by the federal government through this 2005 congressional action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A draft agenda published by the CDC shows what will be on the schedule for Wednesday and Thursday&rsquo;s meetings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Resources &amp; Services Administration has clarified what needs to happen for a vaccine to become liability free:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For a vaccine to be covered, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must recommend the category of vaccine for routine administration to children or pregnant women, and it must be subject to an excise tax by federal law.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dossier has reported extensively on the coordinated effort by Big Pharma and the Biden Administration to delay the rollout of an FDA approved COVID vaccine, with legal experts suspecting the process is in place to protect Pfizer and Moderna from legal liability from vaccine injuries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once described as the cure to the coronavirus, the novel mRNA shots have resulted in catastrophic failure, with a side effect profile exponentially higher than advertised. Thanks to a fraudulent, deceptive marketing campaign, assisted by top federal officials and high-profile pharmaceutical executives, the drugmakers and the federal government convinced millions of Americans to take shots that were much more dangerous (especially for young men), and much less effective than advertised.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of COVID Mania, Pfizer and Moderna have raked in hundreds of billions of dollars in liability free dollars, enriching their executives and board members beyond their wildest dreams. Thanks to Big Pharma&rsquo;s successful regulatory capture of Government Health, and corrupt bureaucrats&rsquo; willing compliance, it looks like the mRNA drug cartel will be completely off the hook when it comes to compensating the countless Americans who were harmed by their junk products.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden plans to release even more barrels of oil from the federal government&rsquo;s strategic reserves to keep gas prices low before the midterm elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s latest decision marks more than 200 million barrels set for release in less than two years as president, more than all previous presidents combined according to the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Biden&rsquo;s historic oil releases to bring down the cost of gasoline, the OPEC+ nations announced their decision in October to cut oil production by two million barrels a day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president expressed his disappointment with OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s decision, despite administration officials working behind the scenes urging them to delay their cuts until after the midterm elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden recently campaigned in California where gas prices are nearly seven dollars a gallon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about prices approaching seven dollars a gallon in the state, Biden replied, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s always been the case here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite gas prices rising again, Biden continues taking credit for gas prices declining from record highs in the Summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[A] lot of it is the result of getting the cost of living at the gas pump down by more &mdash; now even in California now &mdash; by more than a dollar nationally and &mdash; since the start of summer,&rdquo; he said during a speech on Americans suffering from higher costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/china-cuts-off-natural-gas-supplies-to-europe-just-in-time-for-winter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/china-cuts-off-natural-gas-supplies-to-europe-just-in-time-for-winter/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China Cuts Off Natural Gas Supplies to Europe, Just in Time for Winter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist China has told state-owned energy-importing companies to cease sending natural gas supplies to European nations already facing a catastrophic winter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bloomberg, the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s National Development and Reform Commission also told the state-owned energy giants CNOOC, PetroChina, and Sinopec to halt shipments of liquified natural gas to foreign buyers in Europe and Asia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China scooped up excess Russian gas since the war in Ukraine, as Europe faces an unprecedented energy crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communist nation has managed to build up an excess of liquified natural gas amid lockdowns to comply with Beijing&rsquo;s zero-Covid agenda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Russia reduced shipments to the European Union in response to the bloc&rsquo;s support of Ukraine and sanctions on Moscow, China began reselling its surplus LNG cargo to the EU at inflated prices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to estimates, some four million tonnes of liquid natural gas was resold by China, which accounts for approximately seven percent of Europe&rsquo;s imports during the same period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese government has not given a specific reason for halting the supply of natural gas supplies on the open market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the move could be an attempt by Xi Jinping to aid his ally Vladimir Putin in putting the squeeze on Europe at a crucial moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite falling gas prices in Europe from their high in August, the European Union is still considering placing a price cap on imported LNG.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia&rsquo;s state-owned Gazprom responded by threatening to cut off all shipments to Europe, forcing the EU to reach out to countries like China selling on the international market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EU globalists have rushed towards their green agenda and forestalled domestic energy production, specifically Germany, which banned fracking for its own natural gas in favor of cleaner alternatives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move, however, has just left the bloc beholden to Russia to meet its energy needs and, ironically, China to meet its green goals &ndash; given that almost all solar panels are made in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the head of the green lobbyist group, admitted: &ldquo;Everybody knows what&rsquo;s going on in China, and when facilities are based there, you have to accept that there&rsquo;s a high possibility that forced labour will be used.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston University Defends Controversial Study on COVID Hybrid Strain With &rsquo;80 Percent&rsquo; Mortality Rate in Mice</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston University issued a statement Tuesday defending its research of a COVID-19 Omicron strain when they took the variant&rsquo;s spike protein and attached it to the original COVID-19 strain, leading to a higher mortality rate in a certain species of mice, triggering concern among lawmakers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Omicron S-bearing virus robustly escapes vaccine-induced humoral immunity, mainly due to mutations in the receptor-binding motif&hellip; while Omicron causes mild, non-fatal infection, the Omicron S-carrying virus inflicts severe disease with a mortality rate of 80 percent,&rdquo; the preprint study said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Emily Erbelding, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&rsquo;s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, told Stat News that the Boston University&rsquo;s grant application didn&rsquo;t specify that researchers wanted to perform this work and the group did not say it was performing experiments to possible enhance a COVID-19 variant. An investigation is now underway, she said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston University issued a lengthy statement defending its research and said critics have misrepresented the goals of the study while refuting allegations that the study involved gain-of-function research, which can make a pathogen more deadly or transmissible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The research was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which consists of scientists as well as local community members,&rdquo; the statement from Boston University said. &ldquo;The Boston Public Health Commission also approved the research. Furthermore, this research mirrors and reinforces the findings of other, similar research performed by other organizations, including the FDA. Ultimately, this research will provide a public benefit by leading to better, targeted therapeutic interventions to help fight against future pandemics.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain reports about the study were &ldquo;false and inaccurate,&rdquo; Boston University official Ronald Corley said in a statement. A report from the Daily Mail, he alleged, took the &ldquo;80 percent&rdquo; line out of context.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report: NASCAR To Review Bubba Wallace&rsquo;s Attack On Kyle Larson At Las Vegas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report claims NASCAR will review Bubba Wallace&rsquo;s attack on Kyle Larson that occurred during the race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for those that never watch NASCAR, myself included, Bubba Wallace was the gentleman who claimed he found a noose in his garage at a NASCAR racetrack, a race baiting move&hellip;&nbsp; but it turned out to be just a regular noose used to open the garage door&hellip; anyways:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the race, Kyle Larson got loose underneath Bubba Wallace, but appeared to save the car. There does not appear to be any contact made between the two drivers at this point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Wallace slammed hard into the wall and bounced down the track into Larson. Larson then dived hard down into the track to avoid Wallace who chased him down the track and purposely clipped Larson in the rear quarter panel sending him spinning up the track into Christopher Bell and the outside wall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&rsquo;s the commentator&rsquo;s take live at the race:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanye West to Buy Parler to Cement Its &lsquo;Uncancelable&rsquo; Status, Protect Conservative Views</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billionaire musician Kanye West is buying Parler, the free speech-championing social media app that rose to prominence amid allegations that rival Twitter was suppressing conservative voices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parler, which bills itself as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s pioneering uncancelable free speech platform,&rdquo; announced the purchase agreement in principle in a press release on Oct. 17, the same day that West joined the service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,&rdquo; West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parler has not disclosed how much West will pay for the platform nor whether the purchase will yield any policy changes, with the deal expected to close by year&rsquo;s end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The proposed acquisition will assure Parler a future role in creating an uncancelable ecosystem where all voices are welcome,&rdquo; Parler said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Farmer, the CEO of Parlement Technologies, the parent company of Parler, welcomed West&rsquo;s involvement in the platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This deal will change the world, and change the way the world thinks about free speech,&rdquo; Farmer said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development comes after West was recently locked out of his Instagram and Twitter accounts after making posts alleged to be anti-Semitic.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/defund-the-police-councilwoman-begs-seattle-police-for-protection-after-poop-thrown-at-her-house?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/defund-the-police-councilwoman-begs-seattle-police-for-protection-after-poop-thrown-at-her-house?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Defund the police' councilwoman begs Seattle Police for protection after 'poop' thrown at her house</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kshama Sawant, the Seattle City Council member who led the charge to defund the police department is now requesting police to protect her home in response to repeated scatological vandalism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources told The Post Millennial that over the past month someone has been throwing human feces at the Marxist councilmember&rsquo;s home. According to the source, the Seattle Police Department responded and took a report, and the councilmember is now requesting a &ldquo;permanent patrol presence monitoring her place from 5 pm -10 pm every day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time the radical councilmember has asked for police protection. In December 2020 following the riots that rocked the city in the wake of the death of George Floyd, Sawant demanded police protection in response to threats. However, it was later revealed that Sawant had used the threats for publicity before contacting the Seattle police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawant was one of the most vocal members of the defund the police movement in Seattle which led to hundreds of officers leaving the force. Following the defunding movement, crime skyrocketed, and the city is on track to beat last year&rsquo;s record-high number of homicides. Rapes and assaults have also spiked. 911 response times have steadily climbed and many residents reported being placed on hold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2020 riots, Sawant used her key to let protestors into Seattle City Hall after hours so that the mob could occupy the building which was also closed to the public due to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawant also led a group of rioters during the deadly Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in the councilmember's district to the home of then-Mayor Jenny Durkan, the location of which was protected under confidentiality laws from her time as a US attorney. The rioters vandalized the house during the stunt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Sawant supporting the deadly occupation of six blocks of Seattle, her staff set up tents inside the zone to collect signatures for a ballot initiative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawant's office was not available for comment.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/a-navy-veteran-showed-up-for-jury-duty-the-judge-sent-him-to-jail-for-not-wearing-a-mask"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/a-navy-veteran-showed-up-for-jury-duty-the-judge-sent-him-to-jail-for-not-wearing-a-mask</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Navy Veteran Showed Up For Jury Duty. The Judge Sent Him To Jail For Not Wearing A Mask.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A North Carolina Superior Court judge ordered a prospective juror to spend 24 hours in jail after he refused to wear a mask in the courtroom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Charles Gilchrist is the only judge in the courthouse who enforces a mask mandate after North Carolina Democratic Governor Roy Cooper lifted a statewide mask mandate for most indoor settings over a year ago. Gilchrist found 47-year-old Gregory Hahn of Harnett County in contempt of court for his refusal to follow the judge&rsquo;s mask order, WRAL News reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The irony of all this is the judge was talking to me without a mask,&rdquo; said Hahn, a Navy veteran who reportedly served on the President&rsquo;s Honor Guard at Arlington National Cemetery. &ldquo;If safety was such a concern, I go to jail [with] no mask requirements with inmates.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clerk of Superior Court Renee Whittenton said in a statement that each of the prospective jurors were told of Gilchrist&rsquo;s mask rule when they checked in, and the court provided them with masks if they did not have one, but Hahn said he was not made aware of the mandate, and it was not listed on Hahn&rsquo;s court summons. The courthouse does not have any signs that state masks are required.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A joint order by Harnett and Lee counties from March stated that masks are optional in hallways, foyers, restrooms, meeting rooms, and similar areas, but the order allowed presiding judges to decide whether they wanted a mask mandate in the courtroom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Navy veteran and single father said Gilchrist asked him twice if he was refusing to wear a mask, and Hahn said he was. The judge then reportedly ordered Hahn to spend 24 hours in jail, and he was handcuffed and taken away minutes later. Hahn said he asked Gilchrist if he could call his son who was at home, but the judge refused his request.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9 Million Californians to Partake in Earthquake Drill</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LOS ANGELES&mdash;Millions of people in government offices, businesses, and schools throughout Los Angeles County this week will stop everything for a minute to &ldquo;drop, cover, and hold on&rdquo; during a statewide earthquake preparedness drill, now in its 14th year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great California ShakeOut of 2022 is scheduled for 10:20 a.m. Oct. 20.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What we do to prepare now, before this big earthquake, will determine how well we can survive and recover,&rdquo; according to a statement posted on ShakeOut.org. &ldquo;Great ShakeOut Earthquake drills are annual opportunities to learn and practice earthquake safety with millions of people.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ShakeOut website indicated that 9.2 million Californians are slated to participate in the drill. During last year&rsquo;s event, about 7.6 million statewide registered to take part.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first drill was held in 2008.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Los Angeles County, more than 3.2 million people have registered for this week&rsquo;s drill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Municipalities whose local government employees will be involved include Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pasadena, Burbank, and Santa Clarita.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Los Angeles city and county agencies are also signed up, including Metrolink and Metro, the Los Angeles police and fire departments, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, Los Angeles Public Libraries, and the city departments of Recreation and Parks, Housing, Aging, and General Services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Los Angeles area community colleges and universities will be participating including the Los Angeles Community College District, Santa Monica College, Pasadena City College, UCLA, and USC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of the county&rsquo;s kindergarten through 12th-grade school districts, along with private and charter schools, will have students and staff participating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ShakeOut.org, the objective is to emphasize precautions during a 7.8-magnitude or larger quake along the southernmost portion of the San Andreas fault.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drill in 2019 came just over three months after the early July quakes that struck Ridgecrest. The 6.4- and 7.1-magnitude shakers caused significant damage to roads and structures in the hamlet, which lies just south of the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Californians should be prepared to be self-sufficient for 72 hours following a major disaster. That includes having a first-aid kit, medications, food, and enough water for each member of a household to drink one gallon per day, according to local and state officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners and renters should also know how to turn off the gas in their residences in case of leaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so long ago, the American dream was alive and well. Employees who worked hard were rewarded, and employers looked for people who could do the job, not for people who had the right political views.&nbsp; RedBalloon.work is a job site designed to get us back to what made American businesses successful: free speech, hard work, and having fun.&nbsp; If you are a free speech employer who wants to hire employees who focus on their work and not identity politics, then post a job on RedBalloon.&nbsp; If you are an employee who is being censored at work or is being forced to comply with the current zeitgeist, post your resume on RedBalloon and look for a new job. redballoon.work, the job site where free speech is still alive!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this happened over the weekend: </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ehxfl9K9Jgg"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;#3 Alabama vs #6 Tennessee Highlights (GAME OF THE YEAR) | Week 7 | 2022 College Football Highlights&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/ehxfl9K9Jgg&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">#3 Alabama vs #6 Tennessee Highlights (GAME OF THE YEAR) | Week 7 | 2022 College Football Highlights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;#3 Alabama vs #6 Tennessee Highlights (GAME OF THE YEAR) | Week 7 | 2022 College Football Highlights&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/ehxfl9K9Jgg&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 16:44-17:31</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was one of the best college football games in recent memory for me, as #6 Tennessee took down #3 Alabama 52-49 as the clock hit zero.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, from the west coast, how about this game? </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MNu7j1KCR_I"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;#7 USC vs #20 Utah Football Game Highlights 10 15 2022&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/MNu7j1KCR_I&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">#7 USC vs #20 Utah Football Game Highlights 10 15 2022</span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#5 Clemson def. FSU 34-28</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tons of undefeated teams came tumbling down this weekend!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly in Baseball, The Padres sent the Dodgers home packing after their Saturday win&hellip; they won the series 3-1. The Astros advanced after sweeping the Mariners. The Phillies defeated the Braves 8-3 to win the series 3-1. The Yankees and the Indians&hellip; not guardians&hellip; Indians, are tied at two games a piece after the Yankees won 4-2 on Sunday.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, welcome back to the table, Neighbor Pkarlgh!&nbsp; Did you know there's a new purple M&amp;M?&nbsp; Supposedly she's female, but we'll see how long that lasts...</p>
<p>Speaking of females--the women on social media are up to their toxic shenanigans again.&nbsp; Newsflash: Women should be respected no matter what they're wearing!&nbsp; (If you disagree, you're probably just an OLD BOOMER.)<br /><br />Next: Before you call a woman a "nag," you need to understand she only verbally abuses her family because she HAS TO.&nbsp; She nags FOR THEM because she loves them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Later:&nbsp; a popular radio host broadcasted some truly terrible advice about encouraging daughters to make their own path and find their identity apart from their families.&nbsp; In case you're wondering why women are so messed up, just listen to Delilah and follow it up with a song by the artist, P!nk.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's a jungle out there, Ladies!&nbsp; Send your emails to <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a> if you've run across Women Behaving Badly and you think we should know about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Toby Sumpter and today is Friday, October 14, 2022, and this is your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.sbts.edu/2022/10/13/fall-trustees-meeting-board-commends-mohlers-stance-on-meaning-of-pastor-in-bfm-2000/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://news.sbts.edu/2022/10/13/fall-trustees-meeting-board-commends-mohlers-stance-on-meaning-of-pastor-in-bfm-2000/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their annual fall board meeting Monday, trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary unanimously adopted a resolution commending the public stance seminary President Albert Mohler took on the office of a pastor during the 2022 SBC annual meeting in Anaheim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Messengers at the SBC&rsquo;s annual meeting in Anaheim, CA, considered precisely what the Baptist Faith &amp; Message 2000 means when it refers to the office of a pastor. Mohler argued that the SBC&rsquo;s confession of faith unequivocally reserves the office, function, and title of pastor to biblically qualified men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohler served on the committee that drafted the BF&amp;M 2000. On the convention floor in June, Mohler told messengers that there was no debate or confusion among BF&amp;M 2000 committee members as to what is meant by the term &ldquo;pastor:&rdquo; it is an office which Scripture defines clearly in terms of qualifications and limits to men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trustees&rsquo; resolution commends Mohler&rsquo;s stance. It concludes: &ldquo;It is further resolved that this Board encourages The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary administration and faculty to continue its theological training with this stated conviction&mdash;graduating both men and women for service to the church, but with men alone reserved for the office and function, and thereby title of pastor.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seminary leaders also reported on the institution&rsquo;s financial health. With financial instability in the United States, Southern Seminary&rsquo;s fiscal position, by God&rsquo;s grace, remains strong, Mohler said. Enrollment continues to be robust; during the 2021-22 school year, Southern experienced its second highest total of student hours sold. In addition, Boyce College has its highest-ever on-campus enrollment with 509 students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&rsquo;t slap &ldquo;family friendly&rdquo; on anything and thereby make it &ldquo;family friendly&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is called &ldquo;grooming&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is great, but parents need to realize that they let this happen. This happened on their watch when they handed the responsibility of educating children over to the state. You didn&rsquo;t protest when the state said they would be taxing your property to pay for schools that they would oversee. You didn&rsquo;t protest when the state implicitly threatened your authority and responsibility through state sponsored education. I appreciate this push back, but we need to take responsponsibility for our complicity in how we got here.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pastor Wilson likes to say that you have to throw down at the first crime scene. When the men in ski masks pull up in their dark van, you don&rsquo;t go with them, you don&rsquo;t go with them to some warehouse, sit down in a chair and calmly let them tie you up and gag you, and then finally when they hang you upside down and point a gun at you, do you start screaming. When we get to the part in the story where elected school boards are sponsoring Drag Queens grooming children for sexaulization, transgenderism, etc, that&rsquo;s a third or fourth crime scene. We didn&rsquo;t yell when they insisted on government sponsored education. We didn&rsquo;t scream when they told us that we don&rsquo;t know how to raise and educate our own children.&nbsp;</span></p>

This </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the marxist play: cultivating difference in order to cultivate envy, enmity, animosity in order for the state to come in and save us. But when the peace of Christ cuts through animosities and enmities, it makes men free. We don&rsquo;t need your government programs. We have Christ. We have His people. We have our families. </span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Life&rsquo;s short</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: And this teaches us to number our days. Confess your sins. Get right with God. Get right with your family. Don&rsquo;t nurse grudges. That makes you susceptible to socialism and marxism. Get clean. Get forgiven. Get free.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Liberty Dispatch</strong> ~ October 13, 2022</p>
<p class="p1">While a Pzifer executive openly admits to the inefficacy of the COVID vaccines to stop transmission, the College of Physicians and Surgeons Ontario (CPSO) advises that doctors ought to medicate those who don't want to take the vaccine rather than giving them an exemption. Tune in as co-hosts Andrew DeBartolo and Matthew Hallick, with guest host Michael Thiessen dig into the crumbling COVID narrative.</p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/56b7facb-18f5-4546-a4cf-c5b0e21de456/dirty-harry-is-a-christian-film-are-you-crazy-maybe.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Dirty Harry is one of Clint Eastwood's best known films. It is also violent, full of profanity, and sprinkled with gratuitous nudity. How could anyone possibly mistake it for a Christian film? Today Chris makes a case for just that--he's not saying you should watch it as a family--or even that you should watch it. He makes the argument instead that it is a film that only makes sense within a Christian worldview--within a Christian framework of meaning. It is filled with subtle allusions to Christ--but the Jesus hinted at in Dirty Harry is not meek or mild. He's angry--and for good reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Today's episode was inspired by an essay published in Law and Liberty by Titus Techera--you can find it here: <a href="https://lawliberty.org/dirty-harrys-justice/?fbclid=IwAR1HvepaLIgMN-21anGWYXfEIXoIdkpjVyxSalVfib-QKmianv2qlpXVdFU"><span class="s1">https://lawliberty.org/dirty-harrys-justice/</span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, here&rsquo;s what you may have missed over the weekend.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/colorado-officials-incorrectly-sent-out-30000-voter-registration-postcards-to-noncitizens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/colorado-officials-incorrectly-sent-out-30000-voter-registration-postcards-to-noncitizens</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado Officials &lsquo;Incorrectly&rsquo; Sent Out 30,000 Voter Registration Postcards To Noncitizens</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado officials claim they accidentally sent approximately 30,000 postcards last month to noncitizens instructing them how they could register to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First reported by Colorado Public Radio News, Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold&rsquo;s office said department employees had sent the postcards on Sept. 27 after comparing a list of 102,000 names provided by the Electronic Registration Information Center, a nonprofit organization aiming to improve U.S. voter rolls and advocating residents to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Department has become aware that approximately 30,000 EBU [Eligible But Unregistered] postcard mailers were incorrectly sent to ineligible Coloradans,&rdquo; a spokesperson for the Colorado Secretary of State&rsquo;s Office told local media. &ldquo;The office is undertaking an internal review of the incident and will take any corrective action that is warranted.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griswold insisted noncitizens would not be allowed to register to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The postcards, which the office printed in English and Spanish, read, &ldquo;A message from Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold . . . Our records indicate that you or your household may be eligible to vote, but do not appear to be registered at your current address.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mailers did include that to vote that residents must be 18 years old by Election Day, a United States citizen, and a Colorado resident for at least 22 days before the upcoming election, according to Colorado Public Radio News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griswold&rsquo;s office said they plan on sending out correction mailers to the noncitizens, &ldquo;reminding them that only those that meet the above requirements are eligible to register.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to local media, while the office had compared the list of potential unregistered voters to local DMV records, the data had included noncitizen drivers with Colorado driver&rsquo;s licenses which the state issues for noncitizens to drive legally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Council on State Legislatures website shows Colorado as one of at least 17 states, along with the District of Columbia, that issue driver&rsquo;s licenses to non-U.S. citizens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the system did not distinguish their eligibility to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the Voting Rights Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told The Journal that the system making a mistake indicates it works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griswold is up for reelection in the November midterms, where she will face Republican Pam Anderson, the head of the state&rsquo;s county clerks association.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-cdc-wont-release-review-of-post-vaccination-heart-inflammation_4786038.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport&amp;src_src=partner&amp;src_cmp=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-cdc-wont-release-review-of-post-vaccination-heart-inflammation_4786038.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport&amp;src_src=partner&amp;src_cmp=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC Won&rsquo;t Release Review of Post-Vaccination Heart Inflammation</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will not release its review of post-COVID-19-vaccination heart inflammation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC has been performing abstractions on reports of post-vaccination myocarditis, a form of heart inflammation, submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the agency is saying that federal law prevents it from releasing the results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abstractions &ldquo;are considered medical records which are withheld in full from disclosure,&rdquo; the CDC told The Epoch Times in a recent letter, responding to a Freedom of Information Act request.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the exemptions in the act says that agencies can withhold materials that are &ldquo;specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, if that statute (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and (B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC pointed to the Public Health Service Act, which was enacted in 1944, and says that vaccine injury reports and other information that may identify a person shall not be made available to any person except the person who received the vaccine or a legal representative for that person.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information sought is available through the CDC website without details that would identify patients, the agency also said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC said that it does not have a formal definition of &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; but that it means the process of reviewing medical records, including autopsy reports and death certificates, and recording data in a database. &ldquo;Please note that this definition means that any abstracted data, because they originate from medical records, is also considered medical records,&rdquo; a CDC records officer told The Epoch Times in an email.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refusing to release the data raises concerns about transparency, according to Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The stubborn refusal of officials heading up federal health agencies responsible for protecting the public health to come clean with Americans about what they know about COVID vaccine risks is stunning,&rdquo; Fisher told The Epoch Times in an email.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher noted that the CDC has funded electronic medical record systems that collect personal health information and that the agency shares the data with a number of third parties, such as contractors and researchers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher called for a congressional probe into what she described as &ldquo;the disturbing lack of transparency on the part of federal agency officials, who granted COVID vaccine manufacturers an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to widely distribute the vaccines in December 2020 and have recommended and aggressively promoted the vaccines for mandated use ever since.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a separate Freedom of Information Act request, the CDC initially said that it did not perform any abstractions or produce any reports on post-vaccination myocarditis. That request was for reports between April 2, 2021, and Oct. 2, 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency also falsely said that a link between myocarditis and the messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccines was not known during that time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A possible link between those vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna, became known in early 2021. Many experts now acknowledge the link is likely or definitely causal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC&rsquo;s director, said in a press conference in April 2021 that the agency had not detected a link between the vaccines and myocarditis. The basis for that statement remains unclear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC still hasn&rsquo;t released the results of the data mining, to The Epoch Times, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), or a nonprofit called Children&rsquo;s Health Defense. The agency also declined to provide results from a different monitoring system, V-safe, to a nonprofit called Informed Consent Action Network, which then sued the agency and just recently received the first tranche of data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA, meanwhile, has refused to release the results of a different type of analysis on the VAERS data, claiming it cannot separate the results from protected internal communications. The agency is also withholding autopsies conducted on people who died after getting COVID-19 vaccines, pointing to exceptions laid out in the Freedom of Information Act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with Johnson, several other lawmakers are pressing at least one of the agencies to release the data, asserting that not doing so is illegal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/10/10/nike-co-founder-phil-knight-donates-1-million-to-republican-oregon-gov-candidate-christine-drazan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/10/10/nike-co-founder-phil-knight-donates-1-million-to-republican-oregon-gov-candidate-christine-drazan/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nike Co-Founder Phil Knight Donates $1 Million to Republican Oregon Gov. Candidate Christine Drazan</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight&rsquo;s donation to Drazan&rsquo;s campaign comes after he donated $3.75 million to Independent candidate Betsy Johnson, signaling his strong dislike for Tina Kotek.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican strategist Rebecca Tweed told KGW Knight&rsquo;s donation said the two donations are not meant as an endorsement of either candidate but rather an attack against the Democrat candidate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The donation comes as Christine Drazan stands within striking distance of unseating Kotek in a deep blue state that has not elected a Republican governor since Vic Atiyeh in 1982.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Breitbart News reported last week, a recent Emerson College poll showed the Oregon House Republican leader actually leading Koteck by two points &ndash; 36 percent to 34 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Emerson College Polling survey shows former Oregon House Republican leader Drazan ahead of former state House Speaker Tina Kotek (D)&ndash;36 percent to 34 percent. Nineteen percent of those polled plan to vote for former Democrat state senator-turned independent Betsy Johnson. The poll was conducted between Sept. 30 &ndash; Oct. 1 with 796 very likely Oregon voters. The survey&rsquo;s Credibility Interval (CI), similar to a margin of error, is &plusmn;3.4 percentage points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGW political analyst Len Bergstein concurred with Rebecca Tweed that Phil Knight&rsquo;s donation should be seen as a knock against Kotek by potentially putting Drazan on the path to victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As soon as he sees some polls that say &lsquo;wait a minute, there&rsquo;s a chance that Drazan could win,&rsquo; he&rsquo;s saying well maybe my money could make the difference to push her over the top,&rdquo; said Bergstein.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is not a normal election. We&rsquo;re having fun watching it because we have three original candidates for governor and a lot of interesting twists and turns in the race already,&rdquo; Bergstein added.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's railway deal to avert strike spiked by union</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a month after President Biden announced that a deal had been reached between railroad companies and their unions, the deal has fallen apart, raising concerns for a possible strike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the Teamsters, one of the nation&rsquo;s largest railroad unions, rejected the deal on Monday, expressing discontent with the number of paid sick days, according to the Washington Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said that members of the third-largest union rejected the proposed five-year contract in a 56 to 43 percent split. Both sides have agreed to continue with negotiations until at least November 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Railroads are currently expected to continue operating normally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal included a 24 percent increase in pay by 2024, as well as $1,000 annual bonuses for employees over five years. The plan ensured that healthcare co-pays would not increase in price, but included only one paid sick day compared to the 15 days union leaders pushed for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal followed two years of negotiations between the rail carriers and unions, which prompted the White House to appoint an emergency board in July to mediate between the two groups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Biden applauded the tentative deal reached, calling it "an important win for our economy and the American people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>At a recent conference in Texas, Gary gave biblical encouragement from 2 Timothy 3. This chapter is often used to prove that we're living in the last days, and a confirmation of the victory of evil over God's kingdom here on earth. This is the exact opposite of what Paul is teaching in this chapter and it's very instructive and important for us to understand the real meaning and context of this passage.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today the Pugcast welcomes French Reformed theologian Yannick Imbert onto the show! Yannick is the author of a new book on J. R. R. Tolkien, "From Imagination to Faerie: Tolkien's Thomist Fantasy". The book is a scholarly treatment of Tolkien's theological outlook and how it shaped Tolkien's understanding of language, myth and imagination. The Pugsters focus in primarily on Tolkien's views on language and how those conflict with contemporary understandings which are largely based on a set of assumptions informed by materialism. Enjoy!</p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/10b6ae5c-4833-42b0-ac7e-f09cf5e6ac7e/daily-news-brief-for-tuesday-october-4th-2022.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, October 4th, 2022. I hope you and your family had a great weekend with you and yours&hellip; also, just a heads up. There will be no newsbriefs for Thursday and Friday this week!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we do that however:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FLF Conference Plug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word didn&rsquo;t stay in Heaven. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory of the Father, full of grace and truth. Grace and Truth became flesh. The Word became flesh. The story of God&rsquo;s grace became flesh. And it is that Word, that truth, that story that will fill the world. That is why this year&rsquo;s Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee is on Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. The Word is a sword. The Word is our glory. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, speakers including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, Ben Merkle, Jared Longshore, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, Chocolate Knox will be doing a round table with the Wilsons and Merkles on why stories are so potent for building family cultures that wine, all culminating in a live show with Megan Basham and Jason Whitlock talking Lies and Journalism. And we just announced a one day Saturday-only pass for 99$. Find out more and register or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/revealed-barbara-bush-childrens-hospital-in-maine-offers-gender-transition-services-for-9-year-olds?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/revealed-barbara-bush-childrens-hospital-in-maine-offers-gender-transition-services-for-9-year-olds?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbara Bush Children's Hospital in Maine offers gender transition services for 9-year-olds</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Barbara Bush Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Maine promotes services for "transgender children," offering life-altering drugs such as puberty blockers and hormone treatments, as well as how-to guides on genital "tucking" for boys and "chest binding" methods for girls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1576654667253022721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1576654667253022721</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:00-2:28</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That video is from a 2016 piece by WMTW ABC News titled "Lucy's story: Transgender children in Maine, Program at Barbara Bush Children's Hospital helps guide transgender children" written by Tracy Sabol.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video a pediatric endocrinologist at the hospital, Dr. Jerrold Olshan, said, "This isn't a choice in most individuals, this is probably biologically programmed."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olshan said "About one in four will attempt suicide, about half will consider suicide during adolescence and so our big goal is how do we help this population do better in the long run," citing the frequently debunked transgender affirm or suicide myth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence has emerged this year that treatment at gender clinics for children are actually increasing suicidal ideation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doctor's belief that gender ideology is "probably programmed" enabled the hospital to not only push chest binding and genital tucking, but life-changing drugs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let&rsquo;s talk about the data:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), the world's largest clinic treating transgender-identified youth, shows that patients treated at or referred to the clinic are at an estimated 5.5 times greater risk of committing suicide than the general population of adolescents, according to a new paper published this month in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several takeaways from Michael Biggs' study: Trans-identified youth treated or referred to GIDs are more likely to die by suicide than youth in the general population. The suicide rate is low for both populations. We cannot conclude that the GIDs patients committed suicide because of their trans identity, versus another cause.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these numbers are estimates based on the best available data; the study results would have been more accurate if a comparison between GIDs suicides and suicides amongst youth getting mental health care could be made. Based on what Biggs found, the media narrative that trans youth are suicides waiting to happen is a lie that does not help&mdash;and is likely to harm&mdash;trans-identified youth and their families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2010 and 2020, four youth out of 15,000 patients died by "known or suspected" suicide. The annual suicide rate of trans-identified youth was 0.03 percent. This is at odds with a mainstream media narrative that claims 50 percent of trans-identified youth attempt suicide, says Michael Biggs, Oxford sociology professor and author of this new paper.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/liberal-strongholds-cling-vaccine-mandates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/liberal-strongholds-cling-vaccine-mandates</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberal strongholds cling to vaccine mandates</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many people, the pandemic no longer factors into daily life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in a handful of liberal cities, universities, and companies, some people are still subject to vaccine mandates that may require as many as four shots to keep their jobs or spots in school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the mandates are facing growing protests and legal challenges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly two dozen former firefighters in Seattle filed a lawsuit against the city this week for denying their requests for religious exemptions to the vaccine and firing them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City&rsquo;s largest police union successfully sued to invalidate the city&rsquo;s vaccine mandate for its members; a judge ruled this week that the union&rsquo;s contract with the police department did not include an ability for the department to enforce such a mandate. The judge ordered the reinstatement of all the union-backed members fired under the vaccination requirements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, New York City officials said they planned to fight the ruling. More than 1,700 city workers across all departments had been fired as of this month over their refusal to comply with the vaccine mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four fired employees of a retirement care facility in Alabama filed a lawsuit last week against their former employer, alleging religious discrimination. The former employees claim their sincere requests for religious exemptions from the company&rsquo;s vaccine mandate were denied improperly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political support for such mandates has dropped precipitously over the past year, and even some of the most ardent defenders of mandates have rolled back requirements they once championed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), for example, boasted in January that his vaccine requirement had nearly doubled the vaccination rate of the state workforce. He stressed at the time that &ldquo;no intervention is as important as vaccination&rdquo; in fighting COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inslee rescinded the vaccine mandate earlier this month, setting an Oct. 31 date for its expiration while citing the value of &ldquo;different tools that are now more appropriate for the era we&rsquo;ve entered.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs had for months required not just COVID-19 vaccines but booster shots as well for employees working from its offices. The investment bank quietly ended its vaccine mandate in late August, as well as its testing requirements and mask guidance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other major companies that pushed vaccine mandates aggressively last year, when the Biden administration was fighting an ultimately losing battle to require vaccination in virtually all workplaces, have since dropped their policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comcast recently dropped its vaccine mandate for employees as it struggles to lure workers back into the office, while JPMorgan Chase said earlier this year that it would start hiring unvaccinated workers again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some corporations continue to insist workers get their COVID-19 shots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google and Facebook, for example, require vaccines for in-person employees, according to Axios .</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the most controversial remaining vaccine mandates is one imposed by Washington, D.C., leaders on children attending public school. Students 12 years and older must be fully vaccinated by January to remain in Washington, D.C., public schools; the deadline was originally set for the beginning of the school year this fall, but vaccination rates among black students, in particular, were low enough that city leaders pushed back the effective date.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some colleges and universities are requiring vaccines and boosters for all students &mdash; even those who take online classes. Georgetown University requires even fully online students to be fully vaccinated if at any point their studies will bring them to campus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the University of California, Berkeley, even vaccinated students will be banned from signing up for classes until they accept a booster shot. Recipients typically aren&rsquo;t eligible for boosters until several months after their primary vaccination series, and in the case of students not yet eligible for their booster shot, UC Berkeley rules say students &ldquo;will not have an enrollment until 30 days after you have become eligible to get your booster.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other jurisdictions are rolling vaccine mandates back slowly to balance the growing opposition to COVID-19 rules with the demands of groups that want them implemented indefinitely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) last week ended the city&rsquo;s policy of demanding that private companies in the city require vaccination for their employees, but he left in place the city&rsquo;s vaccine mandate for its own workers, for example.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/foreign/poland-demands-germany-pay-reparations-for-world-war-ii"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/foreign/poland-demands-germany-pay-reparations-for-world-war-ii</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland demands Germany pay $1.26 trillion in reparations for World War II</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland's foreign minister has signed a diplomatic note requesting that Germany pay the equivalent of $1.26 trillion in reparations for damage incurred by Poland during the Nazi German invasion that set off World War II.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $1.26 trillion amount was calculated from an extensive government report on lasting damages from the war, released on the 83rd anniversary of Germany's Sept. 1 invasion of Poland last month. Poland's Communist government had previously waived all further claims to compensation for WWII in 1953 under pressure from the Soviet Union, but the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) rejects this as invalid, according to Al Jazeera. PiS has taken up the cause of World War II reparations since its ascension to power in 2015, using German aggression in World War II as a central part of its nationalism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[The note] expresses the position of the Polish minister of foreign affairs that the parties should take immediate steps to permanently and effectively &hellip; settle the issue of the consequences of aggression and German occupation,&rdquo; Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said of the matter, adding that it will be one of the foremost points of discussion during German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's visit to Warsaw on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany rejects all Polish claims for reparations, saying the matter has already been settled. It further points to the vast tracks of land Poland took from prewar Germany, given by Joseph Stalin when he redrew the postwar map of eastern Europe, as fitting compensation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Polish government believes the severity of damages from World War II means that further, direct payments are needed in compensation. Six million Poles are estimated to have died during the war.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within Just 48 Hours, Florida Received More Than $20 Million in Hurricane Donations</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla) and First Lady Casey DeSantis are praising the help his state has received following the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Ian. In just 48 hours, the state of Florida raised more than $20 million to go toward its Florida Disaster Fund.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From more than 52 different corporations and individuals such as Tom Brady, David Rubin, and Rumble, First Lady DeSantis says the money shows how loyal people are to Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within just hours of activating the Florida Disaster Fund, over $10 million was raised from countless people and corporations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes to show the support DeSantis has created by keeping his state free from liberal madness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that the money is already hard at work to clean up and restore people&rsquo;s homes after the category 4 storm wrecked livelihoods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis is working hard to make sure his state receives the help they need as the death toll from Ian raised to at least 50 people as floodwaters rise to dangerous levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports, but today&rsquo;s story is a bit of a somber one&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/01/129-dead-during-fan-stampede-after-indonesian-soccer-match/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/10/01/129-dead-during-fan-stampede-after-indonesian-soccer-match/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 125 dead during fan stampede after Indonesian soccer match</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 125 people are dead &mdash; most of them trampled in a stampede&ndash; after violent brawls erupted between opposing fans after a soccer match in Indonesia Sunday, marking one of the deadliest crowd calamities in sporting history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities initially said that 174 people had been killed in the chaos, but the death toll had been revised after officials learned that some victims had been counted twice, according to East Java Deputy Governor Emil Dardak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous fights broke out among rival fans at the Kanjuruhan Stadium in East Java province&rsquo;s Malang city just as Persebaya Surabaya defeated home team Arema Malang 3-2 in the Indonesian Premier League Match on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to break up the fights, riot police fired tear gas which sent hundreds of panicked fans fleeing for the stadium exits, East Java Police Chief Nico Afinta said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the chaos, dozens of people were trampled to death instantly, while others suffocated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afinta said over 300 others were rushed to local hospitals, but many died on the way and during treatment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disaster began when fans of Arema had pelted players and officials with bottles and other objects following their loss, witnesses said. Many then flooded the field to confront the team&rsquo;s management about the unwanted outcome &ndash; Armea&rsquo;s first home loss to Persebaya in 23 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video circulating on social media shows fans from each side of the soccer pitch sprint toward midfield, appearing ready to fight each other before riot police suddenly run between them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other video shows hundreds of fans frantically sprinting across the pitch for the exits, flinging themselves over barriers and desperately climbing fences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot police can be seen kicking and hitting people with batons as they try to get away &mdash; and firing tear gas canisters directly into the crowd at both ends of the field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Officers fired tear gas directly at spectators in the stands, forcing us to run toward the exit,&rdquo; said spectator Ahmad Fatoni. &ldquo;Many victims fell because of shortness of breath and difficulty seeing due to tear gas and were trampled.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another video shot from the seats shows a whole section of the stands engulfed in tear gas as fans cry out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disturbing footage shows a mass of injured people packed tightly into an overwhelmed hospital, with some lying motionless on the hospital floor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Indonesia&rsquo;s lack of international accolades in the sport, hooliganism is rife in the soccer-obsessed country where fanaticism often ends in violence, as in the 2018 death of a supporter who was killed by a mob of hardcore fans of rival club in 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that is what happens when you worship other idols other than God&hellip; He gives you over to madness.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We can't promise this conversation will be better than LAST week's, but ...welcome to the table anyway!</p>
<p>Emmi is wearing a lot of hats, and The Peaches is going to her dance class soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Oops, sorry, we mean "rhymic movement.")</p>
<p>Let's talk about Legalism!&nbsp; First--we give a brief history of things that would get you reprimanded by Church People 40 years ago. (Cards, alcohol-consumption, and dancing!)&nbsp; The anti-dancing crowd will say it's important to "avoid the appearance of evil."&nbsp; And, to that, a ready reply should be: "True! So why don't you stop appearing to be such a Pharisee???"&nbsp; &nbsp; This is known as Good Rhetoric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, The Peaches makes an excellent transition to discussing the NEW Legalism: Internet Karens who say all disciplinary spanking is abusive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be a Pharisee.&nbsp; So--Christians need to use this fact to their rhetorical advantage.&nbsp; In other words, we need to get better at framing the anti-spank Pharisees as judgmental jerks.&nbsp; If you're looking for an example of an actual social media exchange with a Pearl-Clutching Karen who doesn't love her kids enough to spank them, we've got you covered!&nbsp; Visit Kendra Tierney's blog, Catholic All Year, if you want great advice from an experience mom who spanks her kids with great results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com -- and visit the website (johnbranyan.com) for information about going on vacation with us!&nbsp; &nbsp;Vacay with Comics, 2023.&nbsp; It's gonna be great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ian-impact-path-d4db93bcac5af1134e31a3b7f2f694f0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ian-impact-path-d4db93bcac5af1134e31a3b7f2f694f0</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PUNTA GORDA, Fla. (AP) &mdash; Rescue crews piloted boats and waded through inundated streets Thursday to save thousands of Floridians trapped amid flooded homes and shattered buildings left by </span><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Ian,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which crossed into the Atlantic Ocean and churned toward another landfall in South Carolina.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hours after weakening to a tropical storm while crossing the Florida peninsula, Ian regained hurricane strength Thursday evening after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center predicted it would make landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devastation inflicted on Florida began to come into focus a day after </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ian-live-updates-cc53497a4e7a53523c4f63c7bd9ffa0a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian struck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a monstrous Category 4 hurricane and one of the strongest storms ever to hit the U.S. It flooded homes on both the state&rsquo;s coasts, cut off the only bridge to a barrier island, destroyed a historic waterfront pier and knocked out electricity to 2.67 million Florida homes and businesses &mdash; nearly a quarter of utility customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least one man was confirmed dead in Florida, while two other people were reported killed in Cuba after the hurricane struck the island Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aerial photos from the Fort Myers area, a few miles west of where Ian struck land, showed homes ripped from their slabs and deposited among shredded wreckage. Businesses near the beach were completely razed, leaving twisted debris. Broken docks floated at odd angles beside damaged boats and fires smoldered on lots where houses once stood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how anyone could have survived in there,&rdquo; William Goodson said amid the wreckage of the mobile home park in Fort Myers Beach where he&rsquo;d lived for 11 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hurricane tore through the park of about 60 homes, many of them, including Goodson&rsquo;s single-wide home destroyed or mangled beyond repair. Wading through waist-deep water, Goodson and his son wheeled two trash cans containing what little he could salvage of his belongings &mdash; a portable air conditioner, some tools and a baseball bat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road into Fort Myers was littered with broken trees, boat trailers and other debris. Cars were left abandoned in the roadway, having stalled when the storm surge flooded their engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never seen storm surge of this magnitude,&rdquo; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told a news conference. &ldquo;The amount of water that&rsquo;s been rising, and will likely continue to rise today even as the storm is passing, is basically a 500-year flooding event.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving Florida as a tropical storm Thursday and entering the Atlantic Ocean north of Cape Canaveral, Ian spun up into a hurricane again with winds of 75 mph (120 kph). The hurricane center predicted it would continue to strengthen before hitting South Carolina on Friday, but still remain a Category 1 storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hurricane warning was issued for the South Carolina coast and extended to Cape Fear on the southeastern coast of North Carolina. With tropical-storm force winds reaching 415 miles (667 kilometers) from its center, Ian was forecast to shove storm surge of 5 feet (1.5 meters) into coastal areas in Georgia and the Carolinas. Rainfall of up to 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) threatened flooding from South Carolina to Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheriffs in southwest Florida said 911 centers were inundated by thousands of stranded callers, some with life-threatening emergencies. The U.S. Coast Guard began rescue efforts hours before daybreak on barrier islands near where Ian struck, DeSantis said. More than 800 members of federal urban search-and-rescue teams were also in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Orlando area, Orange County firefighters used boats to reach people in a flooded neighborhood. A photo the department posted on Twitter showed one firefighter carrying someone in his arms through knee-deep water. At an area nursing home, patients were carried on stretchers across floodwaters to a waiting bus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those rescued was Joseph Agboona. &ldquo;We were happy to get out,&rdquo; he said after grabbing two bags of possessions when water rose to the windows in his Orlando home. &ldquo;It was very, very bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fort Myers, Valerie Bartley&rsquo;s family spent desperate hours holding a dining room table against their patio door, fearing the storm raging outside &ldquo;was tearing our house apart.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I was terrified,&rdquo; Bartley said. &ldquo;What we heard was the shingles and debris from everything in the neighborhood hitting our house.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm ripped away patio screens and snapped a palm tree in the yard, Bartley said, but left the roof intact and her family unharmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fort Myers, some people left shelters to return home Thursday afternoon. Long lines formed at gas stations and a Home Depot opened, letting in a few customers at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Pino was near the back of the line, with about 100 people in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I hope they leave something,&rdquo; Pino said, &ldquo;because I need almost everything.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities confirmed at least one Florida death &mdash; a 72-year-old man in Deltona who fell into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in the heavy rain, the Volusia County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said. Two other storm deaths were reported in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said his office was scrambling to respond to thousands of 911 calls in the Fort Myers area, but many roads and bridges were impassable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency crews sawed through toppled trees to reach stranded people. Many in the hardest-hit areas were unable to call for help because of electrical and cellular outages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chunk of the Sanibel Causeway fell into the sea, cutting off access to the barrier island where 6,300 people live. It was unknown how many heeded orders to evacuate, but Charlotte County Emergency Management Director Patrick Fuller expressed cautious optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No deaths or injuries have been confirmed in the county, and flyovers of barrier islands show &ldquo;the integrity of the homes is far better than we anticipated,&rdquo; Fuller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South of Sanibel Island, the historic beachfront pier in Naples was destroyed, with even the pilings underneath torn out. &ldquo;Right now, there is no pier,&rdquo; said Penny Taylor, a Collier County commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Port Charlotte, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-hurricanes-health-hurricane-ian-storms-feafd6741badece7e416d9f1bfb2db73"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a hospital&rsquo;s emergency room flooded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fierce winds ripped away part of the roof, sending water gushing into the intensive care unit. The sickest patients &mdash; some on ventilators &mdash; were crowded into the middle two floors as the staff prepared for storm victims to arrive, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian struck Florida with 150 mph (241 kph) winds that tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane ever to hit the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While scientists generally avoid blaming climate change for specific storms without detailed analysis, Ian&rsquo;s watery destruction fits what scientists have predicted for a warmer world: stronger and wetter hurricanes, though not necessarily more of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This business about very, very heavy rain is something we&rsquo;ve expected to see because of climate change,&rdquo; said MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see more storms like Ian.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/first-trans-army-officer-doctor-wife-indicted-for-attempting-to-give-russia-compromising-medical-information-about-members-of-us-military-spouses-report?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/first-trans-army-officer-doctor-wife-indicted-for-attempting-to-give-russia-compromising-medical-information-about-members-of-us-military-spouses-report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first transgender officer in the U.S. Army and wife have both been indicted for allegedly attempting to communicate with Russian officials in the hopes of giving them kompromat on some members of the military and their spouses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer, Major Jamie Lee Henry, 39, and wife Dr. Anna Gabrielian, 36, had reportedly made contact with someone whom they thought worked at the Russian embassy but who was actually an undercover FBI agent. </span><a href="https://health.usnews.com/doctors/jamie-henry-978328"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an internist, is a medical doctor with security clearance at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, one of the largest military installations in the entire world. Gabrielian, an anesthesiology and critical care instructor at Johns Hopkins, allegedly expressed hope to the FBI agent that they could use her husband's security clearance to obtain the private medical records of some strategic members of the military and/or their spouses and relatives that Russian officials could then "exploit."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the indictment, which was unsealed on Thursday, Gabrielian said she was motivated to help Russia because of her Russian patriotism, and her </span><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/anna-gabrielian"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Johns Hopkins does indicate that Gabrielian speaks fluent Russian. However, it is unclear whether she is a Russian national or somehow otherwise affiliated with the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Henry was not said to be motivated by Russian patriotism, the indictment does suggest the Army officer expressed some sympathy for Russian interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My point of view is until the United States actually declares war against Russia," Henry allegedly told the agent, "I'm able to help as much as I want."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry also told the agent that Henry had attempted to enlist in the Russian army to fight against Ukraine but had been rejected for a lack of combat experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The way I am viewing what is going on in Ukraine now, is that the United States is using Ukrainians as a proxy for their own hatred toward Russia," Henry allegedly said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabrielian also allegedly called Henry a "coward" when the Army officer expressed misgivings about violating HIPPA regulations in service to Russia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a meeting with the agent at a hotel last month, Gabrielian reportedly gave the agent private medical information belonging to the spouse of a service member in the Office of Naval Intelligence, as well as the information of a relative from an Air Force veteran. Henry likewise handed the agent the medical records of five Fort Bragg patients, according to the filing. It is unclear whether Henry had treated those patients personally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that meeting, the couple also supposedly attempted to establish a contingency plan, in the event they were ever arrested.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabrielian allegedly requested that the Russian embassy help find her children "a nice flight to Turkey to go on vacation" so that they couldn't be used as "hostages" against her if she were ever incarcerated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Henry and Gabrielian have been charged with conspiracy and wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information. They face up to 15 years in prison each, if convicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple were married in 2015, the same year Henry came out as transgender. At the time, Henry gave an interview with </span><a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/byt-interviews-jamie-lee-henry-ahead-of-the-mautner-project-party"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brightest Young Things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "My passion is service member health," Henry said in the interview. "...The biggest part in supporting the health of service members is listening to them. Trauma has to be handled on an individual&rsquo;s timeline and in a way that is unique to that individual."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brightest Young Things has since changed its name to </span><a href="https://exactlyagency.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It claims to be an "award-winning Design, Strategy, and Events agency for brands who want to stay relevant with today's beautifully diverse audience."</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B220928"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B220928</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almighty God says in His Word, &ldquo;Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people&rdquo; (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Prov%2014.34"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proverbs 14:34</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Scripture also teaches that it is the chief duty of any civic leader to reward those who do well and to punish evildoers (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom%2013.1%E2%80%937"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romans 13:1&ndash;7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). You have not only failed in that responsibility; you routinely turn it on its head, rewarding evildoers and punishing the righteous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Word of God pronounces judgment on those who call evil good and good evil (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Isa%205.20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isaiah 5:20</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and yet many of your policies reflect this unholy, upside-down view of honor and morality. The diabolical effects of your worldview are evident in the statistics of California&rsquo;s epidemics of crime, homelessness, sexual perversions (like homosexuality and transgenderism), and other malignant expressions of human misery that stem directly from corrupt public policy. I don&rsquo;t need to itemize or elaborate on the many immoral decisions you have perpetrated against God and the people of our state, which have only exacerbated these problems. Nevertheless, my goal in writing is not to contend with your politics, but rather to plead with you to hear and heed what the Word of God says to men in your position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Let all kings bow down before Him, all nations serve Him&rdquo; (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps%2072.11"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psalm 72:11</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;He who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God, is as the light of the morning when the sun rises&rdquo; (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/2%20Sam%2023.3%E2%80%934"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 Samuel 23:3&ndash;4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is an abomination for kings to commit wicked acts, for a throne is established on righteousness&rdquo; (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Prov%2016.12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proverbs 16:12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/still-no-charges-for-man-who-admits-to-shooting-84-year-old-pro-life-canvasser"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/still-no-charges-for-man-who-admits-to-shooting-84-year-old-pro-life-canvasser</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still No Charges For Man Who Admits To Shooting 84-Year-Old Pro-Life Canvasser</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man who has admitted to shooting a pro-life canvasser earlier this month is still not facing charges and remains under investigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Harvey, 74, admitted during a news interview that he fired off a &ldquo;warning shot&rdquo; from his .22 caliber rifle when he heard his wife allegedly arguing with the elderly pro-life activist. He then claims he tried to push away her clipboard and accidentally shot her in the front of her shoulder. Notably, the activist, who has not been named, claims she was shot in the back while leaving the residence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I came out and she is screaming and having a great old time, and being told, I&rsquo;m sure I heard at least a dozen times, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re trespassing, get off the property,'&rdquo; Harvey told WoodTV&rsquo;s News 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He &ldquo;fired a warning shot into a pine tree out front&rdquo; and then went to &ldquo;club away&rdquo; the 84-year-old woman&rsquo;s clipboard and the rifle &ldquo;went off,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he&rsquo;s afraid of facing charges, the man told News 8, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always possible, I mean I shot someone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Harvey remains in the clear as of Wednesday. The Michigan State Police are reportedly still looking into the matter and will forward the findings to the Ionia County Prosecuting Attorney&rsquo;s Office, where a decision will be made on potential charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The activist was canvassing against a radical ballot proposal concerning abortion in Michigan, The Daily Wire reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right to Life Michigan said in a statement on Saturday that the woman was canvassing in her community of Lake Odessa, Michigan, when she was shot in the back while leaving a residence during a &ldquo;heated conversation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman the victim was speaking to before the shooting was Harvey&rsquo;s wife, Sharon Harvey, according to the admitted shooter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is gaining attention in light of the Department of Justice&lsquo;s targeting of a pro-life activist and Catholic father of seven Mark Houck, who was arrested at his home in Pennsylvania on Friday by armed FBI argents over an alleged simple assault outside a Planned Parenthood clinic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ has also been sleeping on the dozens of attacks against pro-life pregnancy centers and churches by abortion extremists following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/09/27/study-finds-mrna-vaccines-taint-breast-milk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/09/27/study-finds-mrna-vaccines-taint-breast-milk/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STUDY: COVID Vaccines Detected In 45% Of Breast Milk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trace amounts of Moderna and Pfizer&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccines were detected in new mothers&rsquo; breast milk, according to a study conducted by researchers at New York University.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report &ndash; &ldquo;Detection of Messenger RNA COVID-19 Vaccines in Human Breast Milk&rdquo; &ndash; was uploaded to JAMA Network Open, which is a project of the American Medical Association, on September 26th.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noting that &ldquo;the initial messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine clinical trials excluded several vulnerable groups, including young children and lactating individuals,&rdquo; the New York University Long Island School of Medicine&rsquo;s study attempted to address the research gap by tracking levels of the vaccine in a cohort of breastfeeding women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study analyzed the breastmilk of 11 healthy women, with five study participants receiving a Moderna COVID-19 shot and the remaining six receiving Pfizer&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine. Researchers sampled breast milk for five days post vaccination, and trace amounts were detected in seven samples belonging to five different participants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-five percent of study participants, therefore, saw COVID-19 vaccines taint their breastmilk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the samples containing trace amounts of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA, two participants received a Moderna vaccine and three participants received a Pfizer vaccine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study follows the British government&rsquo;s Department of Health and Social Care recommending against COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant and breastfeeding women, admitting that &ldquo;sufficient reassurance of safe use of the vaccine&rdquo; for the demographic &ldquo;cannot be provided at the present time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, still recommends offering COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to breastfeeding individuals at the time of this study&rsquo;s publication. Other federal agencies have authorized the use of COVID-19 vaccines following a massive lobbying campaign launched by the pharmaceutical companies responsible for manufacturing the products.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional studies into the vaccine have shown adverse effects on the health of its recipients, including altered menstrual cycles in women, lowered sperm count in men, and cardiovascular problems in children and young adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/09/28/house-republicans-claudia-tenney-legislation-redirect-funds-irs-border-patrol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/09/28/house-republicans-claudia-tenney-legislation-redirect-funds-irs-border-patrol/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republicans Introduce Legislation To Redirect Funds From IRS To Border Patrol</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republicans led by New York Rep. Claudia Tenney introduced legislation Wednesday to redirect funds intended for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as the border crisis worsens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, first obtained by the Daily Caller, would rescind all of the unobligated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act,&nbsp; which Biden signed in July, for new IRS enforcement activities. These funds would be reappropriated for the CBP to hire additional agents to secure the Southern Border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have expressed particular concern about the more than $80 billion in new funding for the IRS, which will allow the agency to hire up to 87,000 new employees. Although Democrats claim the increased funding will increase federal revenue and allow Congress to pay down the federal debt, GOP officials argue that middle-class and poorer Americans will face more audits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Biden administration&rsquo;s failure to secure the border and enforce our immigration laws has created an unmitigated disaster at our Southern Border that is impacting communities across the country. Meanwhile, President Biden and Democrats in Congress are ignoring the problem and instead giving tens of billions of dollars to the IRS so that they can audit an additional 700,000 working class Americans,&rdquo; Tenney told the Caller before introducing the legislation.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk expresses interest in doing business with Rumble</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk responded to Rumble founder and CEO Chris Pavlovski on Twitter late Tuesday, suggesting that the two should perhaps meet up. "Maybe worth talking at some point," Musk said to Pavlovski.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all began when Russell Brand was censored by YouTube, which led to Brand moving to the rival platform. Brand released a video talking about that censorship, which was over Covid vaccine information, and how YouTube leaves up videos that claim Covid vaccines are super effective, while taking down those that question it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1574861160502927385"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1574861160502927385</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That piqued Musk's interest. "Maybe worth talking at some point," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumble is a rival to YouTube, and promises a censorship-free, open platform dedicated to free speech, in stark contrast to their primary competitor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now everyone&hellip; it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic!!! Sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/09/kyrie-irving-reveals-he-gave-up-4-year-over-100-million-contract-to-remain-unvaccinated/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/09/kyrie-irving-reveals-he-gave-up-4-year-over-100-million-contract-to-remain-unvaccinated/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyrie Irving Reveals He Gave Up 4-Year Over $100 Million Contract To Remain Unvaccinated</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving recently addressed the media regarding uncertainty he had coming back to the Nets in the off season and revealed he turned down a 4-year $100 million contract to remain unvaccinated despite Nets&rsquo; demand he get vaccinated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in June it was announced that Irving opted into the final year of his contract with the Brooklyn Nets that will earn him $36.5 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving made the announcement through The Athletic&rsquo;s Shams Charania telling him, &ldquo;Normal people keep the world going, but those who dare to be different lead us into tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve made my decision to opt in. See you in the fall. A11even.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Nets&rsquo; media day, Irving was asked about his decision and whether or not he had any doubt about the Nets.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today the Pugcast is joined by Ken Myers, the man behind Mars Hill Audio. Mars Hill Audio was founded by Ken in 1993 after working for National Public Radio and serving as editor of Eternity Magazine. Among conservative Christian intellectuals Mars Hill Audio is an important resource for keeping up with the intersection of Christian thought and cultural trends in the western world. Ken is a long time friend of Chris, but all the Pugsters are big supporters of Ken's work. By the time the interview is over you'll probably want to download the Mars Hill Audio app to your phone. Unfortunately there were some technical glitches during the recording of the interview--but we think this is a pretty great episode nonetheless. We hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p><a href="https://reason.com/2022/09/27/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-lawsuit-pacific-legal-foundation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://reason.com/2022/09/27/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-lawsuit-pacific-legal-foundation/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Flagrantly Illegal': Law Firm Files Lawsuit To Stop Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden's plan to forgive hundreds of billions of dollars in student loan debt violates both federal law and the Constitution, according to a just-filed lawsuit from the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), a libertarian law firm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first serious challenge to Biden's student loan forgiveness plan, which he announced last month. The lawsuit's plaintiff is Frank Garrison, who's also an attorney at PLF. Garrison borrowed federal student loans to pay for law school, but according to him, Biden's debt forgiveness plan will actually subject him to a financial penalty in the form of a state tax. This gives him standing to sue the U.S. Education Department, his lawsuit argues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Garrison, he is already receiving debt relief under Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), a federal program for borrowers who work in public service at nonprofit organizations. Qualifying borrowers who make a certain number of payments and meet maximum income requirements can have the rest of their debts forgiven by PSLF. Garrison expects to qualify in about four years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, debt relief under PSLF is not subject to state taxes. Biden's broad forgiveness plan, however, will be taxed as income in Indiana&mdash;where Garrison resides&mdash;as well as Wisconsin, North Carolina, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Garrison will be "stuck with a tax bill that makes him financially worse off than continuing with his repayment program under PSLF," according to the lawsuit. "He did not ask for cancellation, doesn't want it, and has no way to opt out of it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Pacific Legal Foundation's theory is that this gives Garrison standing to sue the Education Department, the lawsuit's case against the Biden forgiveness plan is more straightforward: PLF is arguing that Biden has violated both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act, which give Congress rather than the president the power to make new regulations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's new plan will forgive up to $20,000 worth of debt for many borrowers. The plan could cost U.S. taxpayers anywhere between $300 billion and a trillion dollars. A low estimate of the cost per individual taxpayer is $2,100.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration has claimed that it has the power to unilaterally forgive student loan debts without consulting Congress. As justification, Biden has cited 2003's Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students, or HEROES Act. This law gave the president some authority to cancel or delay student loan repayments during national emergencies, with the clear intention of offering relief to borrowers who were serving in combat operations during the war on terror. Biden's view is that the COVID-19 pandemic counts as a national emergency, even though he has now declared it definitively "over."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLF's lawsuit takes issue with the pandemic justification for debt relief, noting that the harms purportedly ameliorated with debt forgiveness are not a "direct result" of the "national emergency," as required by the HEROES Act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan forgiveness is set to kick in sometime next month.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials Issue &lsquo;Mandatory&rsquo; Evacuation Orders Ahead of Hurricane Ian</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Ian is now a major Category 3 hurricane as it lashes the western portion of Cuba, although the storm is still forecast to strengthen further before hitting western Florida as officials have implemented mandatory evacuation orders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is a much different storm. [Hurricane] Charley was a lot smaller, it was powerful, it was a Category 4. Most of the damage from Charley was from wind and wind destruction,&rdquo; DeSantis said on Tuesday morning, referring to a 2004 Category 4 storm that hit western Florida&rsquo;s coast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Ian&rsquo;s sustained winds intensified to about 125 mph on Tuesday morning as it made landfall in western Cuba, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s expected to hit near the Tampa area around 2 a.m. on Thursday morning, NHC modeling shows. When it makes landfall, Ian will be at least a Category 3 with 111 mph winds at the minimum, according to the model.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor and other Florida officials warned that people around Tampa should heed evacuation orders due to the significant flooding that Ian is expected to bring. Storm surge of between 5 to 10 feet is anticipated for Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, said the NHC in its update Tuesday. Five to 8 feet of storm surge is also expected between the Suwannee River to Anclote (An-cloat) River areas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We expect to have to evacuate 300,000 people, and that will take some time,&rdquo; Hillsborough County Administrator Bonnie Wise told reporters. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we are starting today.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/shannon-brandt-man-who-ran-down-teen-for-being-a-republican-free-with-no-house-arrest-and-low-bond?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/shannon-brandt-man-who-ran-down-teen-for-being-a-republican-free-with-no-house-arrest-and-low-bond?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota man who killed teen claiming he was 'Republican extremist' out on low bond, no house arrest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon Brandt, the suspect who ran down 18-year-old Cayler Ellingson for being a Republican with his SUV in McHenry, North Dakota last week, is out free with no curfew and no house arrest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Fox News, 41-year-old Brandt, who has been charged with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a deadly accident, was released after posting a $50,000 bond, something former assistant US attorney Neama Rahman called "very low" and "woefully inadequate."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A suspect can be released by posting bail, which is typically 10 percent of the required bond, meaning Brandt would be free after only providing $5,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident occurred on September 18 when the two had a political dispute after a street dance that was held at a local bar. Brandt admitted that his actions were politically motivated because the teen was part of a "Republican extremist group."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is "no evidence" Ellingson was part of any such group according to North Dakota Highway Patrol Captain Bryan Niewind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of his release, Brandt cannot leave North Dakota, cannot consume alcohol, must be in a sobriety program, cannot possess a firearm, and must not be within 300 feet of the Ellingson family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden posted a video to his official Twitter telling Democrats to "fight back against extreme MAGA Republicans" days after Brandt's actions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After U.S. Soldiers Were Told to Go On Food Stamps, Congress Finds Another $12 Billion for Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional lawmakers agreed to a deal that would provide another $12 billion in aid to Ukraine, which would bring the total military and economic resources provided to over $66 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news follows the Senate passing a $40 billion aid package in May, along with a $14 billion package in March.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden earlier this month asked Congress for an additional $11.7 billion in aid for Ukraine, with Congress, in turn, seems to be jumping at his behest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, also earlier this month the Army told active-duty American soldiers to go on food stamps if they were unable to afford food thanks to inflation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food stamps for American soldiers, endless billions for Ukraine. This is your country now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters reports that the funding agreement for Ukraine would address a variety of financial needs for Ukraine, including the hope that it would &ldquo;reduce future energy costs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the White House which had been touting lower gas prices despite them being well over the national average when Biden took office, has suddenly gone quiet. Why? Because they&rsquo;re going back up again.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Washington State Coach Nick Rolovich Has &lsquo;No Regrets&rsquo; Not Complying With State Vaccine Mandate Even After Being Fired</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Washington State coach Nick Rolovich revealed why he did not take the Covid vaccine last year, a decision which ultimately led to his firing after some &ldquo;ugly conversations&rdquo; happened between him and the college&rsquo;s administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coach Rolovich sat down with sports reporter Allison Williams, host of the new Daily Wire exclusive series Breakaways, and spoke regarding his thoughts on the impacts of the controversial vaccine as well as how his stance as a traditional Catholic ultimately led to confrontations with other staff after he chose not to comply with the mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolovich and four other assistant coaches were fired from Washington State in 2021 for their non-compliance with the state vaccine mandate. Because of this, Rolovich was unable to collect the estimated $9 million remaining on his contract with the school. Feeling his rights had been violated, he embarked on a $25 million wrongful termination suit against his former employers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1574072486223699972"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1574072486223699972</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The priest broke it down to me,&rdquo; said Rolovich. &ldquo;Because he wanted to know why, and I said, &lsquo;This is just how I&rsquo;m feeling,&rsquo; and he says, &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s your conscience talking to you and the Catholic Church recognizes your conscience.&rsquo; That was what was speaking to me the whole time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Rolovich made it clear that his biggest regret regarding the whole situation was not making it public earlier while still an employee at Washington State that he was not going to take the shot on the grounds of religious reasons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One tense moment came with Pat Chun, the Washington State athletic director, who laid down the potential pathways things would go down if Rolovich decided to still not comply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[Chun] said, &lsquo;You got four options: resign, get the vax, get a medical exemption, get religious exemption,&rdquo; said Rolovich.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting the shot. I&rsquo;m not resigning. I&rsquo;m not going to get a medical because I could go get a fan card, easy, but then I&rsquo;d be lying&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to do a religious [exemption]. And they both said &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not going to believe you, you know, the governor&rsquo;s not happy with you.'&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolovich did choose the religious exemption route, which was even approved by the school&rsquo;s Human Resources department, but Chun intervened and wrote a letter putting Rolovich&rsquo;s reasoning into question, going as far as to call him a science denier. Because of Chun, Rolovich&rsquo;s exemption was shot down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolovich was not the only employee who was intentionally targeted for questioning the vaccine. David Fox, who was the school&rsquo;s director of football operations, had asked the school&rsquo;s professor of pathology and infectious diseases during a presentation made to the athletic department in a presentation regarding the vaccine, whether it had any long-term impact on women and their ability to become pregnant. This question upset Chun, who later decided he would not renew Fox&rsquo;s contract with the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolovich was upset with Chun&rsquo;s decision regarding Fox, saying &ldquo;I already said to renew him, I was happy with the job he did.&rdquo; A verbal argument spun out when Rolovich confronted Chun, and from there everything got worse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Rolovich doesn&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;ll ever be able to obtain another position coaching again, but if that&rsquo;s the case, he&rsquo;s at peace with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sitting here seven months later, to me, God was right, trusting that feeling and that belief really did end up helping me out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last thing I&rsquo;ll say in this newsbrief, is this&hellip; Pat Chun? AD of WSU, you need to resign. You are a coward, who needs to be away from a leadership position over young men, and has no business being in the position that you are. Your handling over this situation is revolting, and you need to be on your knees, repenting to the Lord. Will Pat ever hear this? Probably not&hellip; but worth mentioning. By the way, if you want to call for Pat to step down, you can send him an email at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Athletics.Director@wsu.edu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, September 27th, 2022. I hope you and your family had a great weekend with you and yours, so here&rsquo;s what you may have missed, over the weekend!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FLF Conference Plug:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word didn&rsquo;t stay in Heaven. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory of the Father, full of grace and truth. Grace and Truth became flesh. The Word became flesh. The story of God&rsquo;s grace became flesh. And it is that Word, that truth, that story that will fill the world. That is why this year&rsquo;s Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee is on Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. The Word is a sword. The Word is our glory. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, speakers including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, Ben Merkle, Jared Longshore, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, Chocolate Knox will be doing a round table with the Wilsons and Merkles on why stories are so potent for building family cultures that wine, all culminating in a live show with Megan Basham and Jason Whitlock talking Lies and Journalism. And we just announced a one day Saturday-only pass for 99$. Find out more and register or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/vladimir-putin-grants-full-russian-citizenship-edward-snowden"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/vladimir-putin-grants-full-russian-citizenship-edward-snowden</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vladimir Putin grants full Russian citizenship to Edward Snowden</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian President Vladimir Putin granted full Russian citizenship to U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snowden, 39, fled the United States to Russia after revealing information about extensive surveillance operations being conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA). He is now a Russian citizen by presidential decree, Reuters reported Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement comes roughly two years after Russia granted Snowden permanent residency in the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country first granted Snowden asylum in 2014 and has since resisted calls to extradite him to the U.S. Snowden faces espionage charges that could land him in prison for up to 30 years in the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategic intelligence expert and author of "Putin&rsquo;s Playbook" Rebekah Koffler says the move likely signals that Snowden is working more closely with the Russian government. She says he is likely now subject to Putin's mobilization order but will be assisting Russian intelligence rather than serving on the front lines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snowden stated in 2019 that he would be willing to return to the U.S. on the condition that he got a fair trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"That is the ultimate goal, but if I&rsquo;m going to spend the rest of my life in prison then my one bottom-line demand that we all have to agree to is that at least I get a fair trial," Snowden told "CBS This Morning" at the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump had stated he was considering Snowden's case for a potential pardon in 2020 but never took action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been one of Snowden's major allies in the U.S., saying the whistleblower unveiled schemes by the U.S. government to surveil American citizens both here and abroad.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-flirts-government-shutdown-manchin-permitting-bill-drag-down-funding-package"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-flirts-government-shutdown-manchin-permitting-bill-drag-down-funding-package</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On to our government here at home: Congress flirts with government shutdown as Manchin permitting bill may drag down funding package</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government is days away from shutting down, and the Senate may not have the votes to pass the initial version of its funding bill as top Democrats press ahead on a deal with Sen. Joe Manchin that may fail Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchin, D-W.Va., agreed to help Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pass Democrats' social tax and spending bill last month. In exchange, Schumer promised Manchin a vote on an energy permitting reform to speed new projects. They are combining that with a government funding bill that must pass by Friday night or else trigger a government shutdown.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with a major test vote with a 60-vote threshold set for Tuesday night, the legislation may not have the support to pass, with opposition coming from both parties. Manchin's office says he is still optimistic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer has also insisted he will follow through on his deal with Manchin. He said Thursday he is "working hard to have it pass."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the vote fails, Congress will be forced to scramble to pass a government funding bill before midnight Friday. That could be a tall task with three legislative days to spare.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible that Manchin's permitting reform provision will be stripped from the funding bill if it fails Tuesday night, so lawmakers can advance the rest of the package later in the week. However, that timing could be close.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among options to help avert a shutdown, lawmakers could pass a one-day or two-day funding bill before passing a bigger package to keep the government funded until after the elections. Another possibility would be both parties in the Senate could cooperate to speed along the funding bill and beat the Friday night buzzer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other issues may also impact votes on the funding bill. According to a source, the package will include disaster relief for Jackson, Mississippi, winter heating assistance, Food and Drug Administration user fee reauthorization and more than $12 billion in new assistance for Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is pushing fellow liberal Democrats to oppose the bill because he does not want to speed along new fossil fuel projects. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., says she wants permitting reform and the funding bill voted on separately. Additionally, the more moderate Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he is upset about language that would give special treatment to the Mountain Valley Pipeline project in West Virginia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of those Democrats have explicitly said yet that they will vote against the government funding package over the permitting reform bill.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if more Republicans break ranks and vote for the funding bill with Manchin's permitting reform, it is still unclear if it will be enough for the bill to clear the 60-vote filibuster threshold.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gates Foundation Funds Clinton Initiative to Force China Reliance On Developing World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is funding a Clinton Health Access Initiative aimed at making developing countries reliant on China for healthcare and medical products, The National Pulse can reveal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Microsoft co-founder&rsquo;s foundation authorized a $560,021 grant to the Clinton Health Access Initiative in September, which will run for 18 months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clinton Health Access Initiative was originally a part of the controversial Clinton Foundation started by former President Bill Clinton but spun off into a separate organization in 2010 though Chelsea Clinton &ndash; the daughter of the former president and his wife Hillary &ndash; joined the initiative&rsquo;s board in 2011.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the grant is &ldquo;to leverage manufacturing capabilities in China to increase supply security and enhance the supply of key health commodities in low- and middle-income countries.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the foundation omitted any further details on how the objective would be accomplished, the grant will likely boost China&rsquo;s manufacturing capabilities and make countries reliant on the communist nation for &ldquo;key&rdquo; healthcare items.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant comes amidst China rolling out its controversial &ldquo;Belt and Road&rdquo; initiative, a key component of the regime&rsquo;s efforts to expand its control globally through predatory infrastructure loans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the U.S. State Department has warned, Beijing &ldquo;uses the Belt and Road Initiative and other undertakings to expand foreign markets for Chinese companies and as a means of drawing nations, particularly their political and economic elites, into Beijing&rsquo;s geopolitical orbit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China has been accused of using similar tactics amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, engaging in &ldquo;healthcare diplomacy&rdquo; to broaden its influence over developing countries. Products manufactured in the country also often have poor efficacy and are tainted with toxic chemicals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gates Foundation grant appears to aid the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s ambitions to intertwine itself within the healthcare infrastructure of countries across the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unearthed grant follows Bill Gates&rsquo;s long history of working with the Chinese Communist Party on business and philanthropic ventures. His foundation appears to demonstrate a similar affinity for the Communist regime, sending sizable grants to additional Chinese entities, including those with ties to the lab believed to be the birthplace of COVID-19.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/alex-baldwin-likely-to-face-charges-in-shooting-death-of-cinematographer-halyna-hutchins?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/alex-baldwin-likely-to-face-charges-in-shooting-death-of-cinematographer-halyna-hutchins?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In entertainment news&hellip; Alex Baldwin likely to face charges in shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alec Baldwin is likely to be charged for shooting and killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of his low budget movie Rust in Bonanza City, New Mexico on October 21, 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Mail reports that Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies submitted a letter on August 30 to the New Mexico financial board, asking for funding to indict four defendants and that it was recently approved. In the letter Carmack-Altwie wrote, "One of the possible defendants is well known movie actor Alec Baldwin."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carmack-Altwie asked for $635,000 to prosecute and said that murder charges were on the table along with other weapons related offenses. She said that a "final piece of evidence" was Baldwin's phone, as authorities were waiting results from its analysis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the shooting, Baldwin had issued a statement: "There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movie was filming at the Bonanza Creek Ranch, a popular production location south of Santa Fe. Baldwin was also a producer on the film and previously said he doesn't blame himself for the accident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I feel that someone is responsible for what happened, and I can't say who that is, but I know it's not me," Baldwin previously said. He said that 24-year-old armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed handed him the gun and he thought it was prepared properly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gutierrez-Reed has denied she did anything wrong but she was named by Hutchins' family in a wrongful death lawsuit as being responsible for the tragedy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, an FBI analysis concluded that Alec Baldwin pulled the trigger of the gun that killed cinematographer Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now&hellip; it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://mynorthwest.com/3614418/rantz-sounders-fans-coach-throw-player-under-bus-over-different-political-opinion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://mynorthwest.com/3614418/rantz-sounders-fans-coach-throw-player-under-bus-over-different-political-opinion/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounders fans, coach throw player under bus over different political opinion</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An online mob of radical Seattle Sounders FC fans went after the team&rsquo;s star defender. And his coach threw him under the bus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xavier Arreaga (ARI-AGA) posted a political cartoon to his Instagram account. It depicted a TV sending rainbows into the brains of two kids, while handing the boy a dress, and the girl men&rsquo;s pants. Behind the kids, two parents are tied up. The point was to call out the media for trying to influence or confuse kids on gender identity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intolerant fans slammed Arreaga for not holding a position they disagree with. Some pretended the cartoon was &ldquo;violence,&rdquo; while others criticized him for being religious. Some want the Sounders to kick him off the team. And his fate may be determined by how he reacts to shameful, intolerant re-education attempts by the head coach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arreaga&rsquo;s position, in as much as the comic represented it, is mainstream.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While culture warriors on the Left aim to bully folks into submission, there is widespread concern that the media (along with educators and activists) is pushing adult issues on children. They&rsquo;re indoctrinating kids with extreme left-wing views on gender, claiming gender is fluid and biology doesn&rsquo;t matter. Whether or not you subscribe to this criticism is immaterial: it&rsquo;s a common position that people of all political stripes hold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in Seattle, you must hold the &ldquo;right&rdquo; position &mdash; the one the city&rsquo;s most extreme activists demand you hold. Sounders fans are disproportionately progressive and socialist. A subsection of the group is irredeemably aggressive in their demands that you think exactly as you do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overwhelmingly white group of activists gets especially angry when a racial or ethnic minority strays from the script. And they came out in full force against Arreaga.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Twitter uproar, and what some speculate was a conversation with the Sounders communications staff, the Ecuadorian defender responded with an apology.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Dear Fans &ndash; Last night I reposted a post of a famous Christian artist in my Instagram stories which at the time seemed normal to me and without thinking that this image was going to cause [sic] and hurt the people of our community, which never it [sic] was my intention. I want to express that I respect the way of life and thinking of all people. Thank you,&rdquo; Arreaga wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head coach Brian Schmetzer is a nice guy and a talented coach. But when he spoke to bloggers demanding he react to Arreaga&rsquo;s post, Schmetzer came off as a condescending, ideological bigot. He&rsquo;s the literal White Knight who is demanding the Ecuadorian think differently.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John has been feeling weird and bad and dumb.&nbsp; That's his way of describing his anxiety attacks which popped up this week out of nowhere.&nbsp; Maybe he needs to do a Brain Dump! (Trademark: Mystie Winckler.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>But...wait, why is Luke wearing a bathrobe?&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, this family knows how to throw some REALLY "dood" parties!&nbsp; But we wouldn't be able to juggle all of those planning details if we didn't have a concrete plan.&nbsp; Don't try to memorize your to do list, Pkarlgh!&nbsp; (A loaf of bread, a container of milk, and a stick of butter.)&nbsp; That's a terrible use of brain power.</p>
<p>Write it down, and then you can free up space for problem-solving...</p>
<p>Next:&nbsp; John thinks memorizing the alphabet is stupid.&nbsp; Total waste of time.&nbsp; Please feel free to weigh in, Pkarlgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later: The Peaches has a new BFF! You should follow Brooks Gibbs on social media. He is a psychologist who teaches kids to be mentally resilient, rather than trying to rid the world of bullies.&nbsp; His advice isn't only appropriate for children in schools...

   <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>FLF Conference Plug</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word didn&rsquo;t stay in Heaven. The Word became flesh. The story of God&rsquo;s grace became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory. It is that Word, that truth, that story that will fill the world. That is why this year&rsquo;s Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee is on Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. The Word is a sword. The Word is our glory. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, speakers including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, Ben Merkle, Jared Longshore, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, Chocolate Knox will be doing a round table with the Wilsons and Merkles on why stories are so potent for building family cultures that wine, all culminating in a live show with Megan Basham and Jason Whitlock talking Lies and Journalism. And we just announced a one day Saturday-only pass for 99$. Find out more and register or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Toby Sumpter, and today is Friday, September 16th, and this is your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-declassification-defense-draws-skepticism-from-judges-11663868282"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-declassification-defense-draws-skepticism-from-judges-11663868282</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s assertion that he declassified </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-search-mar-a-lago-fbi-11660267417?mod=article_inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documents seized at Mar-a-Lago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has come under judicial scrutiny this week, as judges highlighted the limits of that defense and noted a lack of courtroom evidence substantiating it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Trump has for weeks said he declassified materials taken to Mar-a-Lago, his home in Florida. In a Fox News interview that aired on Wednesday night, he said a sitting president doesn&rsquo;t need to have a formal process for </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/decoding-the-various-classifications-of-the-records-trump-had-at-mar-a-lago-11661546902?mod=article_inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declassifying documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and can carry out such an order &ldquo;even by thinking about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Trump&rsquo;s lawyers have been more circumspect in their courtroom statements. They have said declassification is a potential defense they may raise later on, once they have a better understanding of what was seized, but haven&rsquo;t asserted that any specific documents were declassified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those lawyers&rsquo; carefully worded statements drew scrutiny this week, both from </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/appeals-court-grants-justice-department-request-to-put-part-of-mar-a-lago-special-master-order-on-hold-11663804499?mod=article_inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an appeals court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-master-in-trump-mar-a-lago-case-to-hold-first-public-hearing-11663674341?mod=article_inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the court-appointed arbiter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tasked with reviewing the approximately 11,000 documents seized at Mar-a-Lago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie, the semiretired jurist </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-special-master-raymond-dearie-once-oversaw-matters-involving-carter-page-chuck-schumer-11663286636?mod=article_inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serving as special master</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has pressed for specific evidence of a declassification order, telling Mr. Trump&rsquo;s lawyers at a hearing this week: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in a written order on Wednesday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted the lack of evidence at this point validating Mr. Trump&rsquo;s declassification defense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Plaintiff suggests that he may have declassified these documents when he was President,&rdquo; the unanimous three-judge panel said. &ldquo;But the record contains no evidence that any of these records were declassified. And before the special master, Plaintiff resisted providing any evidence that he had declassified any of these documents.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three-judge panel, which included two Trump-appointed judges, also called the declassification argument a &ldquo;red herring.&rdquo; Even if Mr. Trump had declassified the documents, the appeals court said, that wouldn&rsquo;t convert them from government records into his personal property or establish a reason for him to have retained them.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow, Idaho&ndash;New Saint Andrews College, one of only a handful of colleges across the US to refuse federal money, is taking a stand against the White House&rsquo;s attempt to cancel federal student loans and is calling on more schools to speak out against Biden&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Redistributing federal student loan debt to taxpayers reinforces poor financial decisions, ruins the public&rsquo;s trust in higher ed, exacerbates our current inflationary economy, penalizes colleges that decline to take federal funding, and prolongs higher education&rsquo;s game of hide and seek with financial realities,&rdquo; said Dr. Benjamin Merkle, president of the Idaho-based Christian liberal arts college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been referring to this as our &lsquo;</span><a href="https://nsa.edu/posts/meet-big-ed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Ed&rsquo; problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&rdquo; Dr. Merkle said. &ldquo;I believe more and more parents and students have added higher ed to a growing list of other &ldquo;big&rdquo; businesses that abuse power to get easy money.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Merkle added that many political leaders on both sides of the aisle can see the road this is taking us down and how it drives higher ed to an even more precarious position than it's already in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Merkle gave three reasons why more colleges should oppose this new program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>First, Biden&rsquo;s plan doesn&rsquo;t really cancel student loan debt.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It just redistributes it to other taxpayers &ndash; many of whom did not attend college or have already paid back their debt. Adding more taxes to already over-taxed households to cover someone else&rsquo;s bad debt is not equitable, fair, or right.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Second, moving the debt from the students </strong><strong><em>who signed up for the student loan payments in the first place</em></strong><strong> to the taxpayers </strong><strong><em>who didn&rsquo;t</em></strong><strong> will create a series of ripple effects that will be hard to reign in.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our nation&rsquo;s young people will learn that loans&nbsp; don&rsquo;t need to be paid back and taxpayers will grow more skeptical and bitter toward higher ed. Further, each successive generation will expect the federal government to bail them out of their higher ed debt.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Third, the more that higher education participates in these federal loan programs the more it becomes dependent on federal handouts.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the federal government is the primary funder of postsecondary education in America, then colleges and universities are disincentivized to perform better or to offer improved services to their primary consumers: students and parents. Essentially, we are fostering yet another industrial-complex where American industry and the government are embroiled in a &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; mindset that fosters highly irresponsible financial behaviors. Meanwhile, colleges that decline to take federal funding must work even harder to compete for students against institutions that are artificially propped up by the government and where the true cost of education is obscured by a loan cancellation program.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/09/21/josh-hawley-introduce-legislation-student-debt-make-universities-pay-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/09/21/josh-hawley-introduce-legislation-student-debt-make-universities-pay-act/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley will introduce legislation Wednesday that puts colleges and universities on the hook for student debt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was first obtained by the Daily Caller and is titled the Make the Universities Pay Act. The Legislation would require institutions of higher education participating in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program to pay 50% of any student loan balance that is in default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Make the Universities Pay Act would also allow student loan debt to be discharged in bankruptcy and allow undergraduate student loan debt to be discharged five years after the first payment is due, while graduate student loan can be discharged 15 years after the first payment is due. In addition, the bill requires each institution of higher education participating in federal financial aid programs to publish post-graduate outcomes, including mean and median earnings of graduates and student loan default rates, disaggregated by each degree or program of study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration is taking executive action to forgive $10,000 per borrower. The move would clear $321 billion of federal student loans and clear the student debt for almost 12 million people, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/biden-says-hes-not-considering-50000-in-student-loan-forgiveness-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CNBC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For decades, universities have amassed billion-dollar endowments while teaching nonsense like men can get pregnant. All while charging extortionary tuition. Now Joe Biden wants to give away another $1 trillion to prop up the system. That&rsquo;s wrong. Instead, it&rsquo;s time to put universities on the hook and give students the information they need to make informed decisions,&rdquo; Hawley told the Caller before introducing the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley plans on introducing the legislation later Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/09/putin-mobilizing-300000-new-troops-veiled-threat-of-nuclear-war/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/09/putin-mobilizing-300000-new-troops-veiled-threat-of-nuclear-war/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s start with some world news: Putin on video saying he&rsquo;s mobilizing 300,000 more troops; veiled threat of nuclear war</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial military mobilization of 300,000 reserve troops, in a major sign of escalation in the ongoing war in Ukraine. The Russian leader also made veiled threats to use nuclear weapons if Russian territorial integrity is threatened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putin announced the mobilization on Wednesday morning, stating &ldquo;only military reservists, primarily those who served in the armed forces and have specific military occupational specialties and corresponding experience, will be called up.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said 300,000 people will be called up for service in the partial mobilization. Putin&rsquo;s order falls short of a full mobilization of the Russian military, with a full-scale draft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France 24 reported that in an interview with Russian state television, Shoigu said students and those who already served as conscripts would not be called up and the majority of Russia&rsquo;s reserve forces would not be drafted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his announcement, Putin said western nations &ldquo;have even resorted to the nuclear blackmail.&rdquo; Putin said he referred to &ldquo;the statements made by some high-ranking representatives of the leading NATO countries on the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction &ndash; nuclear weapons &ndash; against Russia.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I would like to remind those who make such statements regarding Russia that our country has different types of weapons as well, and some of them are more modern than the weapons NATO countries have.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mobilization comes as Russia has seen setbacks in its war in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have begun to retake territory captured by Russian forces earlier in the year. Last week, Ukrainian forces claimed they retook around 1,000 square miles in a matter of days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mobilization of 300,000 reservists suggests a Russian effort to fend off the Ukrainian offensive and prolong the fighting in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an apparent prelude to Putin&rsquo;s decision, Russian lawmakers pushed through new legislation on Tuesday that would increase the penalties for crimes committed during a period of military mobilization. Reuters reported the bill passed in its second and third readings in the lower house of the Russian legislature, the Duma, on Tuesday. The bill increases criminal penalties for acts of desertion, damage to military property and insubordination during a military mobilization period.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepoliticalinsider.com/southern-border-crossings-hit-all-time-record-this-is-a-national-security-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepoliticalinsider.com/southern-border-crossings-hit-all-time-record-this-is-a-national-security-crisis/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern Border Crossings Hit All Time Record. This Is A National Security Crisis</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We seem to be breaking all sorts of records lately, although perhaps not the ones we wish to be breaking. From crime rates to homelessness, we keep aiming for higher and higher numbers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The southern border is no exception to this phenomenon, with illegal crossing encounters surpassing two million for the first time, with one more month left in the fiscal year to go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the Vice President said, the border is secure, so why do we keep talking about it?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as the Biden administration would like to make us believe that there is nothing to see at the border other than cruel Republican politicians and tumbleweed, we are facing an untenable crisis down Mexico way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longer we ignore it, the more dangerous it becomes. Before diving into the dangers that lurk down south, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the numbers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) reported that last month there were 203,598 illegal immigrant &ldquo;encounters&rdquo; at the southern border &ndash; in other words, people trying to cross the border illegally and coming into contact with U.S. officials. But, unfortunately, that&rsquo;s just the number they know of; there isn&rsquo;t a mechanism to capture the number of &lsquo;gotaways.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gotaways are those that, just as the name entails, got away clean. Over the border and into the interior of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month&rsquo;s numbers bring the total number of encounters for Fiscal Year 2022 to an unthinkable 2,150,370, with one more month to go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time that we broke the record on encounters at the southern border was just the previous Fiscal Year when we surpassed 1.7 million. That&rsquo;s an increase of 450,000 more migrants or the equivalent of two months worth of migrants that came in this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been some months where the CBP has recorded 8,000 illegal immigrants in one day apprehended at the border. If that were to be the daily standard, that would mean each week, 56,000 would be taken in at the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let&rsquo;s see here, in the 11 months of this fiscal year, we have had 2,150,370 encounters. So let&rsquo;s compare that to some other numbers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Population of Chicago = 2.7 million</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Population of Houston = 2.3 million</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Populations of Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, and San Jose = about 1 million</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimated amount of Russian troops deployed to Ukraine = 150,000</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total U.S. military troops to include reservists = 2.2 million</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total active duty Chinese military = 2.2 million</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total active duty Russian military = 1 million</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it this way, we have the equivalent of the city of Houston pouring into our southern border. The world condemned, and rightfully so, the invasion of Russia into Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have 14 times the amount of people invading our southern border. Or, to put it another way, the equivalent of the Chinese active duty military has bombarded the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of people who have attempted to cross is greater than the total populations of 15 entire states: New Mexico, Nebraska, Idaho, West Virginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did anyone vote for this? Do the American people get a say in it? Something to think about folks&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/las-vegas-dem-accused-murdering-journalist-faces-removal-job"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/las-vegas-dem-accused-murdering-journalist-faces-removal-job</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Las Vegas Dem accused of murdering journalist faces removal from job</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Las Vegas Democratic official charged with the stabbing death of a local journalist who was investigating him is facing removal from his elected position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local prosecutors filed a lawsuit Tuesday in civil court to have Robert Telles booted from his role as Clark County public administrator, which handles the assets of people who die without wills.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Telles' arrest Sept. 7 for the alleged murder of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, he has been held without bail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Defendant Telles has neglected to perform the official duties of the Clark County Public Administrator," according to the motion requesting that he be "deprived of and removed from his office."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telles, 45, was elected Jan. 1, 2019, then lost the Democratic Party primary in June &ndash; after German wrote stories accusing Telles of having an affair with a married underling and running a toxic work environment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">German, 69, was working on follow-up reports when he was killed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telles shut off his cellphone Sept. 2 and then attacked German in his home before allegedly fleeing wearing an orange shirt and a wide-brim straw hat, according to police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a prior court appearance, a judge described the killing as "chilling" and said German was "fighting for his life" in his final moments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a judge does not strip Telles of his position, he is entitled to continue raking in his $120,000 a year salary, with another $50,000 in benefits, until his term is up Dec. 31, 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The politician-turned-criminal defendant was assigned a court-appointed attorney Tuesday at his arraignment on one count of murder with use of a deadly weapon on a victim 60 years of age or older. He did not enter a plea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark County District Attorney Robert Wolfson said he would determine in the coming weeks whether Telles will face the death penalty.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/20/kyrie-irving-rips-eric-adams-latest-vaccine-mandate-decision/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/09/20/kyrie-irving-rips-eric-adams-latest-vaccine-mandate-decision/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyrie Irving rips Eric Adams&rsquo; latest vaccine mandate decision</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nets star Kyrie Irving, who missed nearly two-thirds of last season due to his refusal to get a COVID-19 vaccine, ripped New York&rsquo;s latest vaccine mandate decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After New York mayor Eric Adams announced Tuesday that he&rsquo;s ending the private employer vaccine mandate but keeping it for city workers, Irving took to social media to label it a human rights violation of historic proportions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If I can work and be unvaccinated, then all of my brothers and sisters who are also unvaccinated should be able to do the same, without being discriminated against, vilified, or fired,&rdquo; Irving wrote. &ldquo;This enforced Vaccine/Pandemic is one the biggest violations of HUMAN RIGHTS in history.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might suggest that is slight hyperbole, but New York&rsquo;s COVID vaccine requirements have been arguably the strictest in the country. Irving&rsquo;s steadfast refusal to adhere to them saw him limited to just 29 games last regular season and only six home tilts at Barclays Center, once the city loosened rules for unvaccinated athletes and entertainers in March.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A City Hall rep had no comment when asked by The Post about Irving&rsquo;s critique.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving should be available for this upcoming season. That, plus Ben Simmons&rsquo; Nets debut and the likes of Joe Harris returning from surgery, should give Brooklyn a healthier roster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all that matters. That&rsquo;s all that matters,&rdquo; Irving said Sunday on the Boyz Night Out podcast. &ldquo;All the hypotheticals that come when nobody is healthy and when you&rsquo;re not 100%.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving added that his vaccine stance was larger than the missed games.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I played 29 games, I barely played home games. It wasn&rsquo;t a typical season I would have wanted. But things happen,&rdquo; Irving said. &ldquo;I had to stand on a whole bunch of bigger stuff than just that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Irving will continue to stand on his belief that the municipal workers should be free to be unvaccinated, as the private sector employees now are.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our vaccinated workforce kept the city open and operating, with over 300,000 employees it was crucial to put it in place and we&rsquo;re keeping it in place,&rdquo; Adams said while getting his booster at City Hall. &ldquo;Our vaccinated workers have carried out their jobs and stepped up when the city needed them the most and we think it&rsquo;s imperative to send the right message and lead by example.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Adams added that 89 percent of New Yorkers, including children, have been vaccinated. As such, the vaccine requirements for New York City schoolchildren to play sports and other higher-risk extracurricular activities are also being dropped. The city was still encouraging vaccines and boosters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The rollout has been important and crucial and because we&rsquo;ve been so successful, it&rsquo;s time to move on to the next level of fortifying our city,&rdquo; Adams said. &ldquo;This puts the choice in the hands of New Yorkers. It&rsquo;s imperative we&rsquo;re asking them to continue to encourage their employees to get their vaccines and booster shots.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the municipal mandate &ndash; which led to over 1,500 city employees being terminated &ndash; Adams said no end date was imminent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving &ndash; who donated money out of his own pocket to help support WNBA players when the league was shut down due to COVID-19 &ndash; had also said he planned to help the municipal workers who had lost their jobs.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On today&rsquo;s show Tom unpacks insights from Rhys Laverty's article: A Theory of Everything: Christology as a Hope for Evangelical Metaphysical Revival. The guys delve into fascinating topics of how the early theologians of the Church redefined the philosophical as they put its tools and insights into the service of unpacking the Biblical doctrines of Trinity and Christology. The guys look into the question of how Christology in particular gave a set of categories which can help us today in clarifying the biblical understanding of human nature and ethics by supplying it with resources to spell out these core claims in fuller and richer ways, helping us engage the philosophical and metaphysical claims of today's pagan alternatives with a robust Christian vision of completeness in Christ.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study Reveals Masking Kids In School Made &lsquo;No Significant Difference&rsquo; In Stopping COVID Spread.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of face masks in classrooms made &ldquo;no significant difference&rdquo; in COVID-19 infection rates, according to a new study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cohort of researchers from several universities and hospitals in Spain came to the conclusion by analyzing COVID-19 transmission rates, age, and the mandated use of face masks in classrooms across the region of Catalonia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study &ndash; &ldquo;Unravelling the Role of the Mandatory use of Face Covering Masks for the Control of SARS-CoV-2 in Schools: a Quasi-Experimental Study Nested in a Population-Based Cohort in Catalonia (Spain)&rdquo; &ndash; compiled data from 1,907 schools with a total of 599,314 pupils during the first term of the 2021 academic year. It was included in August&rsquo;s edition of the peer-reviewed journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, which is a part of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though COVID-19 variants such as Omicron occurred outside of the timeframe of the study, researchers maintain it is &ldquo;unlikely that the effectiveness of the mask mandate measure will increase with a more transmissible variant.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We analysed routinely collected health data to compare the incidence of SARS-CoV-2, secondary attack rates and the effective reproductive number among school children, comparing those without mandatory face covering masks (FCM) and those with FCM during the first term of the school year 2021&ndash;2022, to assess the effect of FCM mandates on SARS-CoV-2 transmission within schools,&rdquo; explains a summary of the work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers focused on comparing children in the last year of preschool (P5) and the first year of primary education, as the younger group had no face mask mandate, whereas the older group did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The main findings of the study show no significant differences for children in the last grade of preschool (P5) and the first year of primary education in COVID-19 transmission indicators during the study period, despite their difference in FCM mandate and the strong age dependency of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools,&rdquo; explained researchers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In conclusion, FCM mandates in schools showed no significant differences in terms of transmission. Conversely, we found that age is a key component explaining transmission in children,&rdquo; summarized researchers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spanish case study follows additional studies demonstrating the failed efficacy of face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even exacerbating the spread of the virus in certain demographics.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study: Americans Own More Than 415 Million Firearms</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans now own more than 415 million firearms, according to Georgetown professor William English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a key finding of the National Firearms Survey that was conducted last year by Denver-based research firm Centiment at the request of English, a professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. English is a political economist interested in ethics, education, and public policy. The survey, which is part of a larger book project, is reportedly the largest ever undertaken regarding U.S. gun owners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey was administered to about 54,000 U.S. residents aged 18 and older, focusing on 16,708 gun owners who were provided with in-depth questions about their ownership and use of firearms, including defensive uses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the survey was to &ldquo;shed some light from a social-scientific view on the reality of how guns are used and owned in America today,&rdquo; English said during a Sept. 11 podcast produced by The Reload, a publication focused on the policies and politics surrounding firearms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And the attempt was to make it the largest survey of gun owners yet done, particularly so that we can get statistically informative information in all 50 states. Probably the last survey of this scope was done back in 1994 &hellip; but it&rsquo;s now more than a quarter century old,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English teased the findings of the survey in a May 18 summary on an academic website called Social Science Research Network but updated the summary on Sept. 13 to add the 415 million figure for gun ownership.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the U.S. Census Bureau now estimates the U.S. population to be 333 million people, the 415 million figure means that there are now about 1.25 firearms for every person living in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those 415 million firearms, Americans own about 171 million handguns, 146 million rifles, and 98 million shotguns, according to the update. About 39 million individuals, or 48 percent of gun owners, have owned magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. Some jurisdictions regulate magazine capacity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly released information helps to put facts that English previously released from the study into a broader context.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that the United States has an overall rate of adult firearm ownership of 31.9 percent, which suggests that more than 81.4 million Americans aged 18 years and older own firearms. The average gun owner owns about five firearms, and handguns are the most common type of firearm owned, the summary states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among gun owners, 57.8 percent are male and 42.2 percent are female. About 34.3 percent of whites own firearms, compared to 28.3 percent of Hispanics, 25.4 percent of blacks, and 19.4 percent of Asians, according to the summary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a third of gun owners, or 31.1 percent, reported in the survey that they have used a gun to defend themselves or their property, often more than once. The report summary estimated that firearms are used defensively by their owners in about 1.67 million incidents each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handguns are used in 65.9 percent of defensive incidents, although in most such incidents no shot was fired. About a quarter (25.2 percent) of defensive incidents took place inside the gun owner&rsquo;s home, and a little more than half (53.9 percent) happened outside their home but on their property. Almost one in 10 (9.1 percent) of defensive gun uses took place in public and about one out of 30 (3.2 percent) took place at work, according to the summary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report comes after a landmark Supreme Court ruling on June 23 finding for the first time that there&rsquo;s a constitutional right to carry firearms in public for self-defense. The court also found that gun regulations must be deeply rooted in U.S. history if they&rsquo;re to survive constitutional scrutiny, prompting a raft of new lawsuits across the country challenging gun control measures. Applications for gun permits in states that require them have been rising following the court decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden is pushing for a federal ban on so-called assault weapons after Congress approved new gun control measures in June, including financial incentives to encourage the enactment of state-level red-flag gun confiscation laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research paper also comes as major credit card companies, at the behest of gun control activists, are implementing what critics characterize as backdoor gun control. The International Organization for Standardization recently announced that one of its subcommittees had decided to create a new merchant category code for firearms, which were previously under the general merchandise category.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics say the policy change will make it easier for governments both to track and discourage firearms purchases and could lay the groundwork for a national gun registry.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Starts Handing Out Grants to Rid Us of Racist Highways</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden has now officially taken his overcompensation for being an old white guy to the next level by handing out the first federal grants to dismantle our nation&rsquo;s racist highways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is not a typo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than devoting federal resources to improving our national infrastructure, Biden is wasting millions to address the problem of &ldquo;racist roads.&rdquo; What makes a road racist? I&rsquo;m just the messenger here, but according to MSNBC, so-called &ldquo;racist roads&rdquo; being targeted by Biden were &ldquo;designed to facilitate white flight and deprive black communities of housing and commercial opportunities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Lemon schooled by Royals expert on the topic of Britain paying &lsquo;reparations&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British royals expert Hilary Fordwich stunned CNN anchor Don Lemon into silence with her argument that African slave owners owe "reparations" rather than the British Empire, in a viral clip from CNN&rsquo;s coverage of the death of the queen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives on Twitter found the clip hilarious, as it depicted Lemon getting swift pushback for trying to promote the narrative that the British crown owes reparations for slavery.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study Reveals Masking Kids In School Made &lsquo;No Significant Difference&rsquo; In Stopping COVID Spread.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of face masks in classrooms made &ldquo;no significant difference&rdquo; in COVID-19 infection rates, according to a new study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cohort of researchers from several universities and hospitals in Spain came to the conclusion by analyzing COVID-19 transmission rates, age, and the mandated use of face masks in classrooms across the region of Catalonia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study &ndash; &ldquo;Unravelling the Role of the Mandatory use of Face Covering Masks for the Control of SARS-CoV-2 in Schools: a Quasi-Experimental Study Nested in a Population-Based Cohort in Catalonia (Spain)&rdquo; &ndash; compiled data from 1,907 schools with a total of 599,314 pupils during the first term of the 2021 academic year. It was included in August&rsquo;s edition of the peer-reviewed journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, which is a part of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though COVID-19 variants such as Omicron occurred outside of the timeframe of the study, researchers maintain it is &ldquo;unlikely that the effectiveness of the mask mandate measure will increase with a more transmissible variant.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We analysed routinely collected health data to compare the incidence of SARS-CoV-2, secondary attack rates and the effective reproductive number among school children, comparing those without mandatory face covering masks (FCM) and those with FCM during the first term of the school year 2021&ndash;2022, to assess the effect of FCM mandates on SARS-CoV-2 transmission within schools,&rdquo; explains a summary of the work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers focused on comparing children in the last year of preschool (P5) and the first year of primary education, as the younger group had no face mask mandate, whereas the older group did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The main findings of the study show no significant differences for children in the last grade of preschool (P5) and the first year of primary education in COVID-19 transmission indicators during the study period, despite their difference in FCM mandate and the strong age dependency of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools,&rdquo; explained researchers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In conclusion, FCM mandates in schools showed no significant differences in terms of transmission. Conversely, we found that age is a key component explaining transmission in children,&rdquo; summarized researchers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spanish case study follows additional studies demonstrating the failed efficacy of face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even exacerbating the spread of the virus in certain demographics.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study: Americans Own More Than 415 Million Firearms</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans now own more than 415 million firearms, according to Georgetown professor William English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a key finding of the National Firearms Survey that was conducted last year by Denver-based research firm Centiment at the request of English, a professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. English is a political economist interested in ethics, education, and public policy. The survey, which is part of a larger book project, is reportedly the largest ever undertaken regarding U.S. gun owners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey was administered to about 54,000 U.S. residents aged 18 and older, focusing on 16,708 gun owners who were provided with in-depth questions about their ownership and use of firearms, including defensive uses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the survey was to &ldquo;shed some light from a social-scientific view on the reality of how guns are used and owned in America today,&rdquo; English said during a Sept. 11 podcast produced by The Reload, a publication focused on the policies and politics surrounding firearms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And the attempt was to make it the largest survey of gun owners yet done, particularly so that we can get statistically informative information in all 50 states. Probably the last survey of this scope was done back in 1994 &hellip; but it&rsquo;s now more than a quarter century old,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English teased the findings of the survey in a May 18 summary on an academic website called Social Science Research Network but updated the summary on Sept. 13 to add the 415 million figure for gun ownership.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the U.S. Census Bureau now estimates the U.S. population to be 333 million people, the 415 million figure means that there are now about 1.25 firearms for every person living in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those 415 million firearms, Americans own about 171 million handguns, 146 million rifles, and 98 million shotguns, according to the update. About 39 million individuals, or 48 percent of gun owners, have owned magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. Some jurisdictions regulate magazine capacity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly released information helps to put facts that English previously released from the study into a broader context.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that the United States has an overall rate of adult firearm ownership of 31.9 percent, which suggests that more than 81.4 million Americans aged 18 years and older own firearms. The average gun owner owns about five firearms, and handguns are the most common type of firearm owned, the summary states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among gun owners, 57.8 percent are male and 42.2 percent are female. About 34.3 percent of whites own firearms, compared to 28.3 percent of Hispanics, 25.4 percent of blacks, and 19.4 percent of Asians, according to the summary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a third of gun owners, or 31.1 percent, reported in the survey that they have used a gun to defend themselves or their property, often more than once. The report summary estimated that firearms are used defensively by their owners in about 1.67 million incidents each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handguns are used in 65.9 percent of defensive incidents, although in most such incidents no shot was fired. About a quarter (25.2 percent) of defensive incidents took place inside the gun owner&rsquo;s home, and a little more than half (53.9 percent) happened outside their home but on their property. Almost one in 10 (9.1 percent) of defensive gun uses took place in public and about one out of 30 (3.2 percent) took place at work, according to the summary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report comes after a landmark Supreme Court ruling on June 23 finding for the first time that there&rsquo;s a constitutional right to carry firearms in public for self-defense. The court also found that gun regulations must be deeply rooted in U.S. history if they&rsquo;re to survive constitutional scrutiny, prompting a raft of new lawsuits across the country challenging gun control measures. Applications for gun permits in states that require them have been rising following the court decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden is pushing for a federal ban on so-called assault weapons after Congress approved new gun control measures in June, including financial incentives to encourage the enactment of state-level red-flag gun confiscation laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research paper also comes as major credit card companies, at the behest of gun control activists, are implementing what critics characterize as backdoor gun control. The International Organization for Standardization recently announced that one of its subcommittees had decided to create a new merchant category code for firearms, which were previously under the general merchandise category.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics say the policy change will make it easier for governments both to track and discourage firearms purchases and could lay the groundwork for a national gun registry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Starts Handing Out Grants to Rid Us of Racist Highways</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden has now officially taken his overcompensation for being an old white guy to the next level by handing out the first federal grants to dismantle our nation&rsquo;s racist highways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is not a typo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than devoting federal resources to improving our national infrastructure, Biden is wasting millions to address the problem of &ldquo;racist roads.&rdquo; What makes a road racist? I&rsquo;m just the messenger here, but according to MSNBC, so-called &ldquo;racist roads&rdquo; being targeted by Biden were &ldquo;designed to facilitate white flight and deprive black communities of housing and commercial opportunities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fellow white dude Pete Buttigieg, who occasionally makes appearances pretending to be the Transportation Secretary, confirmed that $104.6 million in federal funds from last year&rsquo;s bipartisan infrastructure bill will be used to dismantle Interstate 375 in Detroit.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such was the case at the Texas-UTSA game on Saturday when a fan attempted to jump into the pit with the University of Texas&rsquo;s mascot, Bevo.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unclear what the fan&rsquo;s intentions were, but it&rsquo;s pretty clear what Bevo&rsquo;s intentions would have been if he had felt the slightest bit threatened.

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, September 20th, 2022. Hope you all had a great weekend with you and yours! Before we get to the news&hellip; we are really getting there when it comes to our conference&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FLF Conference Plug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you like Jesus &amp; beer? Then you and your family need to come to the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee, on October 6-8. The topic of this conference is Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. Satan is the father of lies, and the mother of those lies is a government that has rejected God. Christians haven&rsquo;t been reading their Bibles, so we as a society are more susceptible than ever to satan and his lies. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, and more&hellip; AND, stuff for the kids too, like jumpy castles, and accidental infant baptisms! Sign up to attend with you and yours, or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-biden-nears-100-executive-orders-estimated-to-cost-taxpayers-almost-1-5-trillion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-biden-nears-100-executive-orders-estimated-to-cost-taxpayers-almost-1-5-trillion</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden nears 100 executive orders estimated to cost taxpayers almost $1.5 trillion</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden has issued nearly 100 executive orders, which will cost taxpayers up to $1.5 trillion, as the national debt nears $31 trillion, according to an expert.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden currently sits at 99 executive orders since taking office. His torrent pace came primarily within his first year, when he issued more than any president since the 1970s. Memos show at least one outside left-wing group financed by millions from liberal billionaire George Soros has influenced some of Biden's orders and regulatory items.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A budgetary impact analysis, meanwhile, accompanies each order but does not include actual monetary costs. Instead, they contain vague language such as whether an order will have no impact, increase or decrease federal costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes it difficult to pinpoint the actual price tag of Biden's actions. However, a federal budget expert told Fox News Digital that they estimate the costs to be north of $1 trillion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"President Biden's executive actions have cost taxpayers more than $1 trillion so far," the Heritage Foundation's Matthew Dickerson told Fox News Digital in an interview. "That's taking into account the recent student loan executive action, which could cost up to $1 trillion."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's student loan forgiveness is a large chunk of the costs. In August, he announced plans to forgive $10,000 in student debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually, while Pell Grant recipients will receive $20,000 in handouts if their income falls below $125,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student loan handout was initially estimated to cost taxpayers upwards of $500 billion, but a recent Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis shows it could reach upwards of $1 trillion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation is even impacting the U.S. Army, which recently released guidance for soldiers as they fight inflation, including a suggestion that they take advantage of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vast majority of Biden's executive orders came within his first year in office. During that time, he issued 77 orders -- more than any president since Gerald Ford's 1970s administration, an American Action Forum (AAF) study found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayor-eric-adams-says-nyc-considering-legal-action-against-texas-response-migrant-buses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayor-eric-adams-says-nyc-considering-legal-action-against-texas-response-migrant-buses</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Eric Adams says NYC considering legal action against Texas in response to migrant buses</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Sunday that the city is considering taking legal action against Texas over the busloads of migrants sent from the Lone Star State to the Big Apple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our legal team is looking at legal challenges we could do with Texas," the Democrat told CBS 2. "We believe there are some options we have, because when you involuntarily place someone on a bus, we believe that actually skates the law&hellip; We're not leaving any stones unturned to make sure that New Yorkers are [not] being treated in an unfair way."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes as more buses arrived in New York City from Texas Sunday morning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams has also suggested the city may use cruise ships to house the thousands of migrants who have been entering homeless shelters in the city. He said former mayor Mike Bloomberg considered cruise ships as temporary housing to address homelessness but never followed through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since May, at least 11,000 migrants have entered the city&rsquo;s homeless shelters, including 2,500 who arrived on buses sent by Texas. New York City has opened 23 emergency shelters and is expected to open an additional 38, Adams said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other TV interviews on Sunday, Adams called on Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to at least notify the city about migrant buses being sent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City Hall officials called Abbott&rsquo;s office and asked to coordinate the arrival of buses to allow time to contact family members and sponsors of new arrivals and to prepare shelter space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott has said Texas will continue sending buses of migrants to sanctuary cities like New York City, Washington, D.C. and Chicago until the federal government secures the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News' Bill Melugin said a Department of Homeland Security source reported that the El Paso, Texas, sector experienced 1,967 illegal crossings with only 335 Title 42 expulsions during a 24-hour window from Saturday to Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams said in two additional TV interviews on Sunday that Abbott and Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, who flew migrants to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard in Massachusetts, were relocating migrants as a distraction from their "erosions of basic human rights," citing the Republicans' stances on abortion and guns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Illegals Are Heading to Martha's Vineyard Soon</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha's Vineyard may have become the first place in the United States to achieve a 100% deportation rate last week - but more could be coming soon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v1kln51-florida-lt-gov.-hints-marthas-vineyard-libs-are-about-to-get-more-bad-news.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v1kln51-florida-lt-gov.-hints-marthas-vineyard-libs-are-about-to-get-more-bad-news.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is promising more flights packed with illegal aliens will be sent to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, Massachusetts. and other liberal enclaves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a press conference last week, DeSantis vowed to Floridians that he will send more flights of illegal aliens to the homes of the Democrat party&rsquo;s wealthiest communities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remarks came after the "all are welcome" crowd in Martha's Vineyard brought in the national guard to deport an illegal alien population (50) that amounted to 0.28% of the island's total population (17,265). Oddly, while the residents of Martha's Vineyard said that they didn't have the infrastructure to accommodate them, they do have the infrastructure to accommodate tourists over the summer, when the island's population balloons to nearly 200,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v1kapfv-marthas-vineyard-libs-are-panicking-over-50-illegal-aliens.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v1kapfv-marthas-vineyard-libs-are-panicking-over-50-illegal-aliens.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh well there you heard it from one of the locals&hellip; We were also told that Martha's Vineyard didn't have any employment options available for the illegals, which is in stark contrast to the argument that they're willing to do the jobs that Americans apparently "won't do" - and also the island's local paper, which lists over 50 low-skilled job openings.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Kitchen Table of the Comedian Next Door! The Peaches has been feeling more like her old self--which means plenty of things to complain about from the hellish world of social media...</p>
<p>First, one of the Sister Wives divorced her husband.&nbsp; Word on the street is, this particular Sister Wife thinks it's "ridiculous" that her husband's attraction to her is affected by the way she treats other members of the family...&nbsp; (Unsurprisingly, the Internet agrees.)</p>
<p>Next, women have been expecting their husbands to read their minds for a long time. Now--they are beginning to judge their other friends and relatives by the same standard.&nbsp; Love means just KNOWING what to do WITHOUT HAVING TO ASK!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, here are two articles for your consideration.&nbsp; &nbsp; "<a href="https://www.commonsense.news/p/hurts-so-good">Hurts So Good</a>"--about the sudden rise in invisible illnesses. Are mental illnesses contagious?&nbsp; "<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/12/a-new-way-to-be-mad/304671/">A New Way to be Mad</a>"--first published in 2000, about the link between Transgenderism and people who want to remove healthy limbs/digits.</p>
<p>Join us at the Fight, Laugh, Feast Conference in Knoxville, October 6th-8th.&nbsp; John will be glad to see you, even if The Peaches isn't.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In today&rsquo;s episode, David uses a conception of the Constitution expressed by five U.S. Supreme Court justices in the 1992 decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, that affirmed the abortion holding in Roe v. Wade. He weaves it, along with a common every day legal practice involving millions of Americans a year, into the theme on which the whole story of the Bible rests.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FLF Conference Plug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word didn&rsquo;t stay in Heaven. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory of the Father, full of grace and truth. Grace and Truth became flesh. The Word became flesh. The story of God&rsquo;s grace became flesh. And it is that Word, that truth, that story that will fill the world. That is why this year&rsquo;s Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee is on Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. The Word is a sword. The Word is our glory. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, speakers including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, Ben Merkle, Jared Longshore, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, Chocolate Knox will be doing a round table with the Wilsons and Merkles on why stories are so potent for building family cultures that wine, all culminating in a live show with Megan Basham and Jason Whitlock talking Lies and Journalism. And we just announced a one day Saturday-only pass for 99$. Find out more and register or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Toby Sumpter, and today is Friday, September 16th, and this is your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gavin-newsom-asks-consider-kidnapping-charges-gop-governors-ship-migrants-out-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gavin-newsom-asks-consider-kidnapping-charges-gop-governors-ship-migrants-out-state</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span><a href="https://www.gavinnewsom.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Gavin Newsom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has asked the Department of Justice to look into whether sending migrants to other parts of the country constituted kidnapping or other federal crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Newsom asked whether actions by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sending illegal immigrants from their respective states to destinations such as New York City, Washington, D.C. Chicago, and Martha's Vineyard were illegal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Several of the individuals who were transported to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard have alleged that a recruiter induced them to accept the offer of travel based on false representations that they would be transported to Boston and would receive expedited access to work authorization," Newsom wrote. "I urge US DOJ to investigate whether the alleged fraudulent inducement would support charges of kidnapping under relevant state laws."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis most recently sent migrants to Massachusetts on Wednesday after promising he would relocate them to a "sanctuary destination."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"States like Massachusetts, New York and California will better facilitate the care of these individuals who they have invited into our country by incentivizing illegal immigration through their designation as &lsquo;sanctuary states&rsquo; and support for the Biden administration&rsquo;s open border policies," the governor&rsquo;s communications director, Taryn Fenske, told Fox News Digital.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, more and more young people have reported feeling anxious or depressed as a result of the dire warnings about </span><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/climate-alarmism-creates-potential-for-us-food-insecurity-as-anti-farm-sentiment-grows/?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are </span><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/watch-john-kerry-pushes-for-more-green-energy-while-experts-warn-about-energy-shortages?&amp;utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to them everywhere they look. Perhaps nowhere is this more prevalent than in institutions of higher learning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to address the mental health consequences of being constantly warned that the planet is on its last leg, there has been a push from within colleges and universities to provide </span><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/al-gore-compares-climate-change-skeptics-to-uvalde-cops-who-let-school-kids-get-slaughtered/?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counseling services to students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, members of the </span><a href="https://sustain.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11_Climate%20Change%20and%20Mental%20Health_Kluttz.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of British Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s Sustainability Initiative released a report detailing the relationship between climate change and mental health, offering a "systemic approach to action in post-secondary education."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Direct and indirect stressors from climate change," they wrote, "as well as the overarching psychological and psychosocial challenges associated with acknowledging the magnitude of the crisis, lead to mental distress and disrupt mental health and wellbeing. Addressing the challenges that the climate crisis poses to mental health, and finding ways to live with and adapt to the overarching psychological and psychosocial weight of the crisis is needed to build healthy and resilient individuals and communities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report recommended that existing counselors be trained to discuss climate change, and that more direct lines of communication be opened between them and climate change activist groups on campus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the University of Michigan, a pilot program has been set up creating a therapy group that will meet for one hour every week for just over three months to see how receiving emotional support can help students overcome their anxiety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant director of the University of Oregon&rsquo;s Office of Sustainability, Sarah Stoeckl, argued that without such services available to students, they will feel "paralyzed in &hellip; uncomfortable emotions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the counselors who have chosen to integrate knowledge of climate change into their skillset, some have argued that "eco-anxiety" is unlike other mental health challenges in that in this case, "the psychological part is really meant to go hand in hand with climate action."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research from </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lancet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 84 percent of children and young adults around the world are "at least moderately worried" about climate change, while over half said they are "very or extremely worried."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most striking, however, was the finding that 45 percent of those surveyed said that their thoughts and feelings about climate change "negatively affected their daily life and functioning," with many reporting a "high number of negative thoughts about climate change."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe we could just tell the kids the truth?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailysceptic.org/2022/09/14/climate-emergency-not-supported-by-data-say-four-leading-italian-scientists/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailysceptic.org/2022/09/14/climate-emergency-not-supported-by-data-say-four-leading-italian-scientists/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: earlier this week it was reported that four leading Italian scientists have undertaken a </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-02243-9.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of historical climate trends and concluded that declaring a &lsquo;climate emergency&rsquo; is not supported by the data. Reviewing data from a wide range of weather phenomena, they say a &lsquo;climate crisis&rsquo; of the kind people are becoming alarmed about &ldquo;is not evident yet&rdquo;. The scientists suggest that rather than burdening our children with anxiety about climate change, we should encourage them to think about issues like energy, food and health, and the challenges in each area, with a more &ldquo;objective and constructive spirit&rdquo; and not waste limited resources on &ldquo;costly and ineffective solutions&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course this is not at all unrelated to the fact that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/title-ix"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> training at </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/harvard-university"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reportedly told students that failing to use a person's preferred </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/transgender-issues"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pronoun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be a violation of university policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mandatory training contained multiple fictional scenarios explaining possible violations of the university's Title IX policies, including one in which a student repeatedly uses the "wrong pronouns" to address someone while making comments about gender identity, </span><a href="https://freebeacon.com/campus/harvard-tells-students-using-wrong-pronouns-constitutes-abuse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Free Beacon</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The training said the behavior described in the scenario "contribute[s] to a climate of disrespect and may also violate Harvard's policies." Violations of university Title IX policy on sexual harassment can be punished by "admonition" or even "termination, dismissal, [or] expulsion."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another slide contained a diagram of a "Power and Control Wheel," which reportedly detailed a number of possible behaviors that could violate the university's policies, including sexual, verbal, emotional, and physical abuse, as well as "cultural/identity abuse," which included "using the wrong pronouns."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wheel diagram is surrounded by words describing "attitudes, beliefs, and systems," including "racism, xenophobia, sexism, classism, cisheterosexism, ableism-sizeism &amp; fat-phobia."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard's treatment of incorrect pronoun use as a violation of Title IX is not unique. In May, a school district in Wisconsin initiated disciplinary proceedings against three male students who refused to address another student by his or her preferred pronouns. In June, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/fairfax-schools-students-right-secret-gender"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County Public Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strengthened district policies that could see students punished for the same infraction.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/mike-lindell-fbi-seizes-cellphone"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/mike-lindell-fbi-seizes-cellphone</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Lindell says the FBI confiscated his cell phone at drive-thru of a Hardee's</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillow entrepreneur Mike Lindell claimed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation confiscated his cell phone while he was at a Hardee's restaurant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindell made the revelation in a video posted to social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1569847934849634306"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1569847934849634306</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindell further elaborated about the incident on his show, "The Lindell Report." He said he was going through the Hardee's drive-thru when FBI agents approached him and demanded he hand over his phone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that he eventually handed over his phone after consulting his lawyer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindell said that the search warrant was likely related to his claims about voting machines manufactured by the Dominion company. He has been one of the foremost proponents of the conspiracy theory that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump through the use of fraudulent voting machines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search warrant was likely a part of a dozens of subpoenas reportedly issued by the Department of Justice in connection to the probe into efforts to overturn the official results of the election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion filed a $1.3 billion lawsuit in February 2021 over Lindell's accusations. He issued a defiant response over the lawsuit in January.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I want Dominion to put up their lawsuit because we have 100% evidence that China and other countries used their machines to steal the election," Lindell said.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/white-house-grapples-to-avoid-nationwide-railroad-strike-that-could-send-gas-prices-soaring-hamstring-supply-chain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/white-house-grapples-to-avoid-nationwide-railroad-strike-that-could-send-gas-prices-soaring-hamstring-supply-chain</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House Grapples To Avoid Nationwide Railroad Strike That Could Send Gas Prices Soaring, Hamstring Supply Chain</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House is seeking to prevent a nationwide railroad strike that could worsen supply chain bottlenecks and increase gas prices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific announced embargoes on certain shipments earlier this week as negotiations continue with two of the nation&rsquo;s largest rail unions &mdash; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and SMART Transportation Division. The Biden administration created a Presidential Emergency Board via executive order two months ago to facilitate the negotiations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have made crystal clear to the interested parties the harm that American families, businesses and farmers, and communities would experience if they were not to reach a resolution,&rdquo; White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday, adding that the administration is working with shipping, trucking, and air freight companies to &ldquo;see how they can step in and keep goods moving in case of this rail shutdown.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is slated to host union leaders and rail company executives on Wednesday morning, according to a statement from a Department of Labor spokesperson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain bottlenecks driven by widespread labor shortages and lockdowns in Asian manufacturing hubs have impacted the American economy over the past two years, contributing to higher inflation as consumer goods fail to reach shelves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily cost of a nationwide rail shutdown could amount to $2 billion, according to a report from the Association of American Railroads. Moving shipments to truckers would require the equivalent of 467,000 additional long-haul trucks per day &mdash; growth that would take &ldquo;years of concerted effort&rdquo; to achieve, especially amid a shortage of more than 80,000 truck drivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Retail Industry Leaders Association explained in a July letter to the Biden administration that freight rail accounts for 40% of long-distance shipping volume &mdash; &ldquo;more than any other mode of transportation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the White House suggested increasing railroad employee pay by 24% over the next two years &mdash; a measure that would lead to an average raise of $11,000 per employee. &ldquo;An agreement based on these terms would lead to the largest general wage increase in nearly 40 years,&rdquo; Association of American Railroads CEO Ian Jefferies said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas prices could increase between $0.35 and $0.75 per gallon if a railroad strike continued for multiple days, warned GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan. &ldquo;Since ethanol primarily moves via rail, and much of the nation blends ethanol into all grades, it would be a big challenge,&rdquo; he remarked on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national average price of gasoline was $2.38 per gallon when Biden assumed office and increased to $3.53 per gallon by the start of the Russian invasion. After surpassing $5.00 per gallon in early June, prices have subsided to $3.70 per gallon as of Wednesday, according to data from AAA.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPAC Pressuring Every GOP Office To Support Bill Banning Gender Surgeries On Minors</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC) sent a letter Tuesday to every Republican in the House of Representatives, calling on them to cosponsor a bill that would ban gender surgeries on minors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter, which was first obtained by the Daily Caller, was sent to every House Republican Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff and Legislative Director and urges them to back Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene&rsquo;s &ldquo;Protect Children&rsquo;s Innocence Act.&rdquo; The bill charges any person who knowingly performed gender-affirming care on a minor with a Class C Felony, which could put them in prison for 10 to 25 years or require a maximum $250,000 fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, originally introduced on Aug. 19, also prohibits all taxpayer-funded gender-affirming care, prohibits institutions of higher education from providing instruction on gender-affirming care, and more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Across the country we have seen the radical gender politics of the Woke Left infiltrate all facets of our lives. As a result, the Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC) has undertaken an effort to drive legislation throughout the country to protect children from the Left&rsquo;s radical gender theory in schools, sports, and medicine,&rdquo; the letter reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As such, we view Rep. Taylor Greene&rsquo;s Protect Children&rsquo;s Innocence Act as common-sense legislation meant to protect children. Accordingly, CPAC supports the Protect Children&rsquo;s Innocence Act and urges you to co-sponsor the legislation,&rdquo; the letter continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Caller reported Tuesday that the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction promotes transgender video and reading resources explicitly aimed at preschoolers, according to a guide titled &ldquo;Resources for Gender Expansive Preschoolers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2022/09/14/almost-half-san-francisco-residents-say-were-victims-of-crime-in-past-5-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2022/09/14/almost-half-san-francisco-residents-say-were-victims-of-crime-in-past-5-years/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly half of all San Francisco, California, residents say that they have been victims of crime in the past five years, according to a survey conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chronicle reported Tuesday:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sweeping poll commissioned by The Chronicle drew sobering results: Nearly half of respondents said they were victims of theft in the last five years, while roughly a quarter were physically attacked or threatened. The majority had negative impressions of law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SFNext poll asked a random sample of 1,653 city residents more than 90 questions about numerous aspects of life in San Francisco. It was conducted in late June and July, and respondents reflect the city&rsquo;s demographics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-five percent of people surveyed for the poll said they had an item stolen within the last five years. Proportionally, Black and mixed-race respondents felt a more severe impact than other groups, with a majority &mdash; 54% of Black respondents and 55% of mixed-race respondents &mdash; reporting they had suffered theft. Property crime rates were lower for white residents, 43% of whom had a possession swiped within the time period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics of the poll suggest that it may have underreported crimes against Asian-American residents, who feel vulnerable lately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chronicle also reported that two-thirds (65%) of residents said life in the city had declined since they had moved there: &ldquo;[T]he greatest unhappiness stems from frustration with the city&rsquo;s biggest, seemingly intractable problems &mdash; particularly homelessness, public safety and housing affordability &mdash; as well as with the politicians who haven&rsquo;t solved them yet.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Marathon Creates &lsquo;Nonbinary&rsquo; Category for 2023 Race</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston Marathon has succumbed to the next radical LGBTQ agenda by creating a &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo; category for runners who claim to be neither male nor female.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston Athletic Association confirmed on Monday that the new category would be included in all its races, including the 5K, 10K, and the half marathon going forward, according to the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new category was seen in the registration information released Monday for the Marathon&rsquo;s 127th run set to be held on April 17, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials have not yet finished crafting its qualifying standards for so-called &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo; runners, but the online applications will include nonbinary as a gender option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;&lsquo;Discussions are ongoing with nonbinary athletes in an effort to further promote inclusion at all BAA events. We view this first year as an opportunity to learn and grow together,&rdquo; the BAA said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston Marathon is not the first race to add such a category. Race organizations in Philadelphia and Brooklyn have already set up nonbinary categories for sponsored races.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some on social media worried that allowing nonbinary runners will lower standards for entrants. One social media user, for instance, noted that if they don&rsquo;t make the standards hew toward the higher male standards, slower runners will abuse the category just to get qualified in a race for which it is notoriously hard to win entry.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today&rsquo;s show returns to the subject of the disenchantment and reenchantment of the world.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Bible prophecy, we are often playing on a chessboard that&rsquo;s been set up by a group of competitors and with pieces that can move only in terms of their rules. This means that before there can be a discussion of any type of millennialism, there must be an evaluation of passages that seemingly discount each one. The prophetic board must be swept clean before any of the so-called millennial positions can be discussed.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we reflect on the legacy of Elizabeth II, the role she played in influencing culture, and the Christian virtue she exhibited as a monarch who was self-consciously under the authority of God. Scripture has much to say about thrones and kingdoms, and Joe Boot discusses some of the major passages for how a king is to rule.</p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk's Twitter buyout deal APPROVED by shareholders</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Twitter&rsquo;s shareholders voted to approve Elon Musk&rsquo;s $44 billion buyout deal that was set in motion earlier this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Verge, sources yesterday had suggested that a vast majority of shareholders were set to approve of the bid, with the required majority being locked in before Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote comes as Musk is locked in a legal battle with the social media platform over an attempt to terminate the deal, after Musk sought data that confirmed that the number of Twitter accounts that are automated bot accounts is less than 5 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter sued Musk for his attempts to terminate the deal, arguing that Musk created their agreement. The trial is expected to begin in mid-October.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a developing story, so check back with me tomorrow for more updates:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-inflation-comes-in-worse-than-expected-as-food-shelter-costs-surge_4726956.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-inflation-comes-in-worse-than-expected-as-food-shelter-costs-surge_4726956.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Inflation Comes in Higher Than Expected as Food, Shelter Costs Surge</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. annual inflation rate came in at 8.3 percent in August, higher than the market forecast of 8.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This is slightly down from the 8.5 percent reading in July.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core inflation rate, which strips the volatile food and energy sectors, also advanced to 6.3 percent last month. This was also higher than the market expectation of 6.1 percent and up from 5.9 percent in July.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a monthly basis, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1 percent, while the core CPI surged 0.6 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food and shelter costs contributed to the inflation numbers as they increased 11.4 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively, year-over-year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The energy index eased to 23.8 percent, new vehicles surged 10.1 percent, used cars and trucks jumped 7.8 percent, and apparel edged up 5.1 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation services soared 11.3 percent and medical care services swelled 5.6 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the food index, most items were up on both a year-over-year and month-over-month basis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bread prices rose 16.2 percent from the same time a year ago, milk soared 17 percent, eggs spiked 39.8 percent, and fruits and vegetables surged 9.4 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BLS data further showed that meat was mostly up across the board, with uncooked ground beef up 7.8 percent, chicken jumping 16.6 percent, ham rising 9.2 percent, and pork surging 6.8 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a positive note, airline fares, which were up by about 33 percent year-over-year, fell by 4.6 percent on a monthly basis in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the energy front, prices also eased considerably from July to August. Fuel oil slipped 5.9 percent and gasoline declined 10.6 percent. However, electricity prices added 1.5 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. stocks reacted to the hot inflation report. The Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 were down 2.7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, during midday trading on Sept. 13, while the NASDAQ was down 3.85 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial markets have cheered anytime there is the slightest hint of easing inflationary pressures because investors think this would prompt the Federal Reserve to slow down its pace of rate hikes or to cut interest rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central bank officials have repeatedly stated that they do not intend to turn dovish during this tightening cycle until there is clear evidence that inflation is on a downward trend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed Chair Jerome Powell spooked financial markets last month when he told the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium that households and businesses need to brace for &ldquo;some pain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just what our economy needed! More pain&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/stocks-tumble-after-inflation-stays-hotter-than-expected_4727580.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/stocks-tumble-after-inflation-stays-hotter-than-expected_4727580.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks Tumble After Inflation Stays Hotter Than Expected</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks are tumbling and disappointment is shaking markets worldwide Tuesday, following Wall Street&rsquo;s realization that inflation isn&rsquo;t slowing as much as hoped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S&amp;P 500 sank 2.3 percent in early trading Tuesday, threatening to snap a four-day winning streak. Bond prices also fell sharply, sending their yields higher, after a report showed inflation decelerated to 8.3 percent in August, instead of the 8.1 percent economists expected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disappointing data means traders are bracing for the Federal Reserve to ultimately raise rates even higher than expected to combat inflation, with all the risks for the economy that entails.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 603 points, or 1.9 percent, to 31,777, as of 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.1 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all of Wall Street came into the day thinking the Fed would hike its key short-term rate by a hefty three-quarters of a percentage point at its meeting next week. But the hope was that inflation was in the midst of quickly falling back to more normal levels after peaking in June at 9.1 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inflation report arrived before trading began on Wall Street, but it sent a thud through markets worldwide.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">15,000 Union Nurses in Minnesota Begin Strike, Citing Low Wages, Understaffing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 15,000 union nurses at 15 hospitals across seven different health systems in Minnesota have walked off the job, protesting understaffing and overwork in what&rsquo;s believed to be the biggest strike of private-sector nurses in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minnesota Nurses Association strike, slated to last three days, began at 7 a.m. on Sept. 12. The group&rsquo;s membership voted last month to authorize a strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nurses in the Minneapolis and Duluth areas are complaining about low pay, a dearth of resources, and the inability to care for patients properly, such as running wards without lead nurses, and poor shift-scheduling practices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give my patients the care they deserve,&rdquo; said Chris Rubesch, the vice president of the Minnesota Nurses Association and a nurse at Essentia Health in Duluth, according to The Washington Post. &ldquo;Call lights go unanswered. Patients should only be waiting for a few seconds or minutes if they&rsquo;ve soiled themselves or their oxygen came unplugged or they need to go to the bathroom, but that can take 10 minutes or more. Those are things that can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Sept. 1 news conference, Minnesota Nurses Association President Mary Turner said, &ldquo;Our health care and our profession are in crisis.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Response From Hospitals</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While negotiations have been continuing since March, the union decided to proceed with the strike because of the hospitals&rsquo; offer of about 10 percent wage increases over three years. The union had asked initially for a 37 percent boost, before settling on 30 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the Twin Cities Hospitals Group called the request &ldquo;unreasonable, unrealistic, and unaffordable,&rdquo; according to the Minnesota Reformer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospital administrations have hired replacement staff and traveling nurses to keep operations running and bring minimal disruption to patient care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Nurses have steadfastly refused to go to mediation,&rdquo; Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the Twin Cities Hospital Group, which represents four hospital systems, told The Washington Post. &ldquo;Their choice is to strike. This strike is on the nurses.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans Like Work From Home So Much, They&rsquo;ll Take a Pay Cut to Keep It: Study</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers in the United States are willing to take a pay cut so that they can continue working from home, states a study published in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work from home (WFH) was found to average 1.5 days a week worldwide, according to the study conducted by a team of international economists and other experts. The study, &ldquo;Working From Home Around the World,&rdquo; surveyed full-time workers from 27 nations as of mid-2021 and early 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers were found to value the option of working from home for two to three days per week so much that they were willing to take a pay cut of 5 percent on average. In the United States, workers were willing to take a 5.7 percent pay cut for remote work options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, workers across countries wanted 1.7 work-from-home days per week after the end of the pandemic. In the United States, the mean desired WFH days per week was at 2.1. However, the actual WFH days in the country was 1.6 while employers were only planning to offer 0.8 days for remote work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, 5.26 percent of employees working from home for one or more days per week were willing to quit their job if their employer wanted them to return to onsite work for more than five days. In the United States, this number exceeded 40 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, the risk that city-level fortunes will diverge due to work-from-home models is &ldquo;more acute&rdquo; than in other rich nations, the report noted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In part, because political decisions about the provision of local public goods are more decentralized in the United States, and local fiscal resources are more closely tied to local economic prosperity. These aspects of federalism give rise to more scope for a downward spiral in city-level fiscal resources and urban amenities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to other countries, the United States also has more location options sharing the same legal system, cultures, language, etc. As such, if a city&rsquo;s governance were to fail, it is easier to move to another similar but better-performing city, the report stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a report showing that many remote working jobs which popped up during the COVID-19 pandemic have remained open and are expected to remain open in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/12/michael-irvin-chides-stephen-a-smiths-colin-kaepernick-cowboys-idea/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/09/12/michael-irvin-chides-stephen-a-smiths-colin-kaepernick-cowboys-idea/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFL legend Michael Irvin eviscerates idea of Colin Kaepernick joining Cowboys: 'Let's just stop'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Playmaker was not having it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Dak Prescott went down for what might be 6-8 weeks with an injury to his throwing thumb, the &ldquo;First Take&rdquo; crew was bouncing around ideas on what Dallas should do in the interim. Tyler Huntley was broached, but no one ultimately thought that the Ravens would part with him with Lamar Jackson unsigned. Stephen A. Smith brought up Colin Kaepernick, and Michael Irvin shot the idea down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-l0Ao24SpVQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/-l0Ao24SpVQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Play 2:35-4:37</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you notice that Smith tried to back away from the bag of crap that he just lit on fire, and left it for all of us to smell? &ldquo;Oh no I just had five or so people bring it up to me, so I thought I&rsquo;d ask!&rdquo; Yeah nice try buddy, we all know you&rsquo;re just a puppet trying to keep this conversation going about Kaepernick. Even when Kap has ability, he wasn&rsquo;t even that good. He was something new in the league when he helped lead the 49ers to the Superbowl against the Ravens all the way back in 2013&hellip; but since that season, his numbers fell off a cliff&hellip; people clinged to the notion that he was a great qb, all for the sake of pumping up his national anthem protest&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaepernick hasn&rsquo;t played in the NFL since 2016, when he kneeled during the national anthem to protest social injustice while a member of the 49ers. Smith has said in the past that former President Donald Trump inflaming this story was revenge on NFL owners for not allowing him to buy the Bills.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, September 13th, 2022. I hope you all had a restful weekend with your loved ones, so without further adieu, let me remind you about our conference!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FLF Conference Plug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you like Jesus &amp; beer? Then you and your family need to come to the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee, on October 6-8. The topic of this conference is Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. Satan is the father of lies, and the mother of those lies is a government that has rejected God. Christians haven&rsquo;t been reading their Bibles, so we as a society are more susceptible than ever to satan and his lies. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, and more&hellip; AND, stuff for the kids too, like jumpy castles, and accidental infant baptisms! Sign up to attend with you and yours, or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, now let&rsquo;s get to the news!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://reason.com/2022/09/12/americans-spent-more-on-taxes-last-year-than-on-food-health-care-education-and-clothing-combined/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://reason.com/2022/09/12/americans-spent-more-on-taxes-last-year-than-on-food-health-care-education-and-clothing-combined/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans Spent More on Taxes Last Year Than on Food, Health Care, Education, and Clothing Combined</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yikes. New consumer spending data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides some sobering perspective on how much Americans are paying in taxes. The data covers consumer spending across a wide variety of categories in 2021. Overall, taxes accounted for about 25 percent of average consumer spending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BLS measures spending per "consumer unit," which it describes as "either (1) all members of a particular household who are related by blood, marriage, adoption or other legal arrangements; (2) persons living alone or sharing a household with others or living as a roomer in a private home or lodging house or in a permanent living quarters in a hotel or motel, but who is financially independent; or (3) two or more person living together who use their income to make joint expenditure decisions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, each "consumer unit" paid more than $16,000 in taxes last year. This outpaces average spending on food, clothing, education, and health care combined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mean for total spending per unit on health care, food, education, and clothing was $16,721.42. This included an average of $8,289.28 on food, $5,451.61 on health care, $1,226.14 on education, and $1,754.39 on apparel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mean for total spending per unit on taxes was $16,729.73. This included $8,561.46 in federal income tax, $2,564.14 in state and local income taxes, $2,475.18 in property taxes, $5,565.45 in Social Security deductions, and $105.21 in other taxes, offset by an average stimulus payment of $2,541.71.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to this disturbing tidbit, the new BLS data contains a wealth of other information on American spending habits and offers an interesting glimpse at recovery&mdash;and inflation&mdash;during the second year of the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highest expenditure category was housing, at an average $22,623.55 per consumer unit (including property taxes). Major spending categories aside from housing, food, health care, education, and clothing included transportation ($10,961.18), utilities/fuels/public services ($4,223.49), entertainment ($3,567.89), household operations ($1,638.42), and personal care products and services ($770.51).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of numbers for you guys on that one&hellip; moving on:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/Sex-traffickers-nabbed-in-florida-sting-include-disney-employees-police-deputy?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/Sex-traffickers-nabbed-in-florida-sting-include-disney-employees-police-deputy?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex traffickers nabbed in Florida sting include Disney employees, police deputy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Florida sex trafficking sting known as "Operation Fall Haul II" captured a 160 culprits this week with a list that included several Disney employees, a teacher, and Georgia Deputy Police Chief Jason DiPrima.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to local news, DiPrima was considered an up-and-comer in the Georgia force and Sheriff Grady Judd, who ran the sting, said, "If all else fails, he could write a book, 'How to Ruin Your Career in Three Easy Steps.'"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sting operation started on August 29, lasted one week, and was a multi-agency effort led by the Polk County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office (PSCO) Vice Unit. Their efforts found and rescued at least two sex trafficking victims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former cop DiPrima was arrested after he tried to solicit an escort while attending the American Polygraph Association seminar in Orlando on August 31. He thought he was speaking to a sex worker, but was actually talking to an undercover PSCO detective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cartersville Police Department said in a press release that DiPrima had resigned Thursday following the department placing him on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/09/12/biden-loosens-tech-export-restrictions-on-china/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/09/12/biden-loosens-tech-export-restrictions-on-china/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Quietly Loosens Tech Export Rules to Chinese Communist Firms Just Days After Huawei Lobbyist&rsquo;s Brother Joins White House.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House quietly loosened Trump-era restrictions on the sharing of U.S. technology with firms blacklisted for their ties to the Chinese Communist Party, including the controversial Huawei, The National Pulse can report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commerce Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issued a revision to a Trump-era Export Administration Regulations (EAR) newly authorizing the release of certain technology and software for the alleged purpose of &ldquo;standards setting and development in standards organizations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move, which applies to firms that have been blacklisted by the U.S. government, was advertised as addressing confusion over whether American companies need a license to share &ldquo;low-level&rdquo;technology with sanctioned parties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Huawei Technologies Co. &ndash; which was included in the original export ban, as telecommunications firm has extensive links to the Chinese Communist Party &ndash; will now be able to receive certain technologies from American companies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labeled a &ldquo;national security threat&rdquo; by the Trump administration and a decades-long Chinese military collaborator by the U.S. Department of Defense, Huawei routinely provides the regime backdoor access to its products, networks, and devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Department has also emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party uses Huawei as an &ldquo;instrument not only for making money but also for pursuing the Party-State&rsquo;s agenda and fulfilling its strategic objectives [&hellip;] deeply enmeshed in Beijing&rsquo;s system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes after months of wrangling by Huawei lobbyists, those of whom include leading anti-Trump and pro-Biden individuals, such as Trump impeachment support Stephen Binhak, and the brothers of both Biden advisor Steve Richetti and newly minted Biden climate czar John Podesta.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine hails snowballing offensive, blames Russia for blackouts</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian forces kept pushing north in the Kharkiv region and advancing to its south and east, Ukraine's army chief said on Sunday, a day after their rapid surge forward drove Russia to abandon its main bastion in the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian officials accused retreating Russian forces of launching retaliatory attacks on civilian infrastructure, including a thermal power station in Kharkiv, that the authorities in Kyiv said caused widespread blackouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"No military facilities, the goal is to deprive people of light &amp; heat," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter of the attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow denies its forces deliberately target civilians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskiy has described Ukraine's offensive as a potential breakthrough in the six-month-old war, and said the winter could see further territorial gains if Kyiv received more powerful weapons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the worst defeat for Moscow's forces since they were repelled from the outskirts of the capital Kyiv in March, thousands of Russian soldiers left behind ammunition and equipment as they fled the city of Izium, which they had used as a logistics hub.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now we gotta finish with my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/efc12471-fe50-4326-8ff8-99fe0be4de20/tcnd-is-john-weird-hes-a-jeff.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>We open this episode celebrating John's birthday!&nbsp; (Sometimes we celebrate his birthday when he's not actually present...)&nbsp; Tabby is here for a little bit, and the cherry delight is truly delightful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered why restaurants often sing a special happy birthday song rather than the traditional version, allow Tabby to make up a nonsense explanation! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Later: John is encouraging his small congregation to visit ANOTHER small congregation for Sunday services. Does that make him weird?&nbsp; (Short answer: yes.)<br /><br />We spend the rest of the show unpacking WHY John is so weird.&nbsp; And we'll explain why every local church body in the country is a little bit different, but also mostly the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which role do you play in YOUR local church, Neighbor?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In the penultimate episode of this series, David addresses head on the prevailing pessimism for any expectation for cultural progress if Jesus is indeed returning soon. Is obedience then simply for the sake of personal sanctification? A close look at the thread of the Noahic covenant running from Genesis through the epistles gives us a different perspective that should attend our current labors.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Irish teacher has been jailed for refusing to call a boy a girl, Queen Elizabeth II has died, and jail time is being threatened in Europe for turning the heat up too high this winter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&hellip; and more on today&rsquo;s CrossPolitic Daily News Brief. My name is Toby Sumpter and today is Friday, September 9, 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/06/teacher-enoch-burke-jailed-over-trans-pronouns-flap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/09/06/teacher-enoch-burke-jailed-over-trans-pronouns-flap/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A teacher in Ireland has been suspended from work and then jailed for contempt of court after he refused to use the correct pronouns to address a transgender student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enoch Burke was arrested on Monday for violating a court order barring him from teaching at Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School in Westmeath, or even being present there, </span><a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2022/0905/1320639-enoch-burke/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the news site RTE.ie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Michael Quinn found Burke guilty of violating an order made by the High Court last week and sent him to Mountjoy Prison, where he will remain until either he purges his contempt or the court gives further orders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teacher remained defiant in the face of jail time, telling the judge that &ldquo;it is insanity&rdquo; that he would be led out of the courtroom and taken to prison for refusing to give up his Christian beliefs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I love my school, with its motto Res Non Verba, &lsquo;Actions not words,&rsquo; but I am here today because I said I would not call a boy a girl,&rdquo; Burke told the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scandal surrounding Burke began unfolding after the educator, who teaches history, politics and German at the school in Multyfarnham, County Westmeath, refused to address a transitioning student as &ldquo;they&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;he.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burke&rsquo;s stance prompted school officials to place him on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a disciplinary process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the teacher refused to stay away from campus, despite an injunction that was issued barring him from going to the school, or attempting to teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the judge issued an order to arrest Burke after he was found sitting in an empty classroom at the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burke was taken into custody at the school on Monday and taken directly to court, where he told the judge he could not comply with the injunction because it would violate his conscience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I am a teacher and I don&rsquo;t want to go to prison,&rdquo; Burke told the court. &ldquo;I want to be in my classroom today, that&rsquo;s where I was this morning when I was arrested.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added: &ldquo;Transgenderism is against my Christian belief. It is contrary to the scriptures, contrary to the ethos of the Church of Ireland and of my school.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>FLF Conference Plug</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you like Jesus &amp; beer? Then you and your family need to come to the Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee, on October 6-8. The topic of this conference is Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. Satan is the father of lies, and the mother of those lies is a government that has rejected God. Christians haven&rsquo;t been reading their Bibles, so we as a society are more susceptible than ever to satan and his lies. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, and more&hellip; AND, stuff for the kids too, like jumpy castles, and accidental infant baptisms! Sign up to attend with you and yours, or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her son King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was a "moment of great sadness" for him and his family and that her loss would be "deeply felt" around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said: "We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the coming period of mourning, he said he and his family would be "comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King and his wife, Camilla, now Queen Consort, will return to London on Friday, Buckingham Palace said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior royals had gathered at Balmoral after the Queen's doctors became concerned about her health earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the Queen's children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, also gathered there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Liz Truss, who was appointed by the Queen on Tuesday, said the monarch was the rock on which modern Britain was built, who had "provided us with the stability and strength that we needed".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking about the new King, she said: "We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King'."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1567928907411910656?s=20&amp;t=jRqdyIeyvfjUj4nDBZFGsg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1567928907411910656?s=20&amp;t=jRqdyIeyvfjUj4nDBZFGsg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, earlier this morning Uju Anya, Critical Race Theorist at Carnegie Mellon University tweeted: &ldquo;I heard the chief monarch of a thieving raping genocidl empire is finally dying. May her pain be excruciating.&rdquo; Twitter did delete the Tweet as violating its rules, but i a follow up tweet she wrote: &ldquo;If anyone expects me to express anything but disdain for the monarch who supervised a government that sponsored the genocide that massacred and displaced half my family and the consequences of which those alive today are still trying to overcome, you can keep wishing upon a star.&rdquo; Another tweet insists that Queen Elizabeth was not a remnant of colonial times but an active participant in colonialism, &ldquo;she actively tried to stop independence movements &amp; she tried to keep newly independent colonies form leaving the commonwealth. The evil she did was enough&rdquo; and a video is linked to an elderly Kenyan woman who says she was tortured with axes during Kenya&rsquo;s struggle for independence from British colonial rule. The woman in the video demands that Elizabeth pay her back for what was done to to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uju Anya writes so-called &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; curriculum for public schools as well as Diversity Equity and Inclusion training materials. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s doing a lot of good. Not really.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple point I want to make here is that this is a great example of how CRT is not helping anyone at all. Let&rsquo;s grant the possibility that the history is being presented accurately here. I suspect that there might be more to it than is being presented, but let&rsquo;s just grant it for the sake of the argument. You cannot build families, cultures, or nations on this kind of exacting demand for justice. You cannot get it. It&rsquo;s not possible. And it&rsquo;s not possible for two reasons at least: first, you can&rsquo;t quantify the damage and harm and hurt. Can you put that woman&rsquo;s tears in a bottle and measure them out? When would it be enough? It would never be enough. And second, what standard would you use to measure anyway? By what standard? If you appeal to Darwin, you just threw away your standard. If you appeal to Marx, then you are only appealing to a momentary revolution and you&rsquo;re condemned to eternal feuding, since once the oppressed class gets put in charge they will no doubt oppress the previously ruling class, and we will just play see-saw with revenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way out of this is the blood of Jesus. The only way out of this tailspin of feuding bitterness and rage and spite and hate is through forgiveness in the blood of Christ. This is true for England, America, and Kenya, and all the nations of the earth. There will be blood. The only question is whose blood and will it be efficacious blood. The blood of Jesus is efficacious. It actually takes away sin and guilt. It actually allows you to lay down your arms, lay down your vengeance, and forgive. May Uju Anja, the people of Kenya, and all people find peace in the Cross of Christ.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Queen herself once said, &ldquo;History teaches us we&hellip; need saving from ourselves, from our recklessness or our greed. God sent into the world&hellip; neither a philosopher or a general&hellip; but a Saviour with the power to forgive.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of natural gas in </span><a href="http://dailywire.com/topic/europe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has increased </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/back-to-the-dark-ages-tucker-carlson-details-europes-self-induced-energy-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than tenfold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">amid the fallout from the </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/ukraine-russia-war"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian invasion of Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while Russia severed natural gas shipments through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline last week. According to a </span><a href="https://www.blick.ch/politik/gfroerlis-muessen-im-ernstfall-bibbern-heiz-suendern-droht-der-knast-id17851055.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Swiss news outlet Blick, the nation&rsquo;s Federal Law on National Economic Supply permits authorities to fine and imprison residents who consume too much gas if energy rationing becomes necessary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who fail to comply with the temperature mandates could receive sanctions between 30 and 3,000 Swiss francs, the equivalent of $31 and $3,090, Federal Department of Finance spokesman Markus Sp&ouml;rndli told the outlet. Those found intentionally violating the statute would receive up to three years in prison, and those found with negligent violations could be forced to pay 180 days&rsquo; worth of fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the temperature controls, residents will be unable to heat swimming pools, saunas, radiant heaters, or warm air tents, while hot water will not be allowed to reach temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius, or 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The member states of the Swiss Confederacy have until September 22 to voice concerns over the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, a heatwave that has </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/california-democrat-made-fun-of-texas-for-power-issues-now-hes-reminding-his-state-to-brace-for-blackouts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> power supplies in California led utility company Xcel Energy to </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/colorado-residents-find-thermostats-locked-at-78-degrees-due-to-energy-emergency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lock the thermostats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 22,000 people in Colorado at 78 degrees Fahrenheit in the interest of protecting grid capacity. The residents had previously opted into an incentive program that let the firm &ldquo;ease the strain on the electrical grid&rdquo; during the &ldquo;hottest summer days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Union has adopted the official </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2050-long-term-strategy_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of becoming &ldquo;a climate-neutral society&rdquo; by 2050 in accordance with the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement. Citing the failure of hydropower facilities amid drought conditions, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen likewise </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/european-union-intends-to-flatten-the-curve-for-electricity-use"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a &ldquo;mandatory target&rdquo; for reducing usage in the European Union, of which Switzerland is not a member.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If you look at the costs of electricity, there are peak demands. And this is what is expensive, because, in these peak demands, the expensive gas comes into the market,&rdquo; she commented on Wednesday. &ldquo;So what we have to do is to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">flatten the curve</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and avoid the peak demands. We will propose a mandatory target for reducing electricity use at peak hours.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flatten the curve. Where have we heard that language before?</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief for Thursday, September 8th, 2022. Happy Friday Jr. everyone! Before we jump into the news today:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/fauci-jean-pierre-to-turn-over-emails-sent-to-social-media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/fauci-jean-pierre-to-turn-over-emails-sent-to-social-media</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fauci and Jean-Pierre ordered to turn over emails sent to social media companies:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Louisiana-based federal judge ruled that White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Dr. Anthony Fauci will have to turn over emails sent to social media companies on the subject of censorship and misinformation of online content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who are both Republicans, filed a lawsuit in May accusing President Joe Biden's administration of working in tandem with social media companies to suppress free speech, with specific allegations tied to information regarding elections and COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorneys general have been deliberating for months with the White House over which documents need to be shown in the lawsuit. On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Terry Doughty ruled the Biden administration must hand over Fauci's and Jean-Pierre's relevant emails within 21 days despite objections from the Justice Department, which cited executive privilege and presidential communications privilege.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crux of the lawsuit focuses on how social media companies handled claims about the origins of COVID-19, as well as how Big Tech platforms limited the reach of a New York Post article in November 2020 about information found on a laptop that once belonged to the president's son, Hunter Biden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their initial filing, Landry and Schmitt argue that "having threatened and cajoled social-media platforms for years to censor viewpoints and speakers disfavored by the Left, senior government officials in the Executive Branch have moved into a phase of open collusion with social-media platforms under the Orwellian guise of halting so-called 'disinformation,' 'misinformation,' and 'malinformation.'"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair of Republican attorneys general already obtained records earlier this month showing multiple federal agencies' officials contacted social media companies to develop content moderation strategies. One of the emails revealed the Department of Health and Human Services and Facebook personnel worked together to take down groups on the platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/american-federation-of-teachers-political-expenses-tax-form"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/american-federation-of-teachers-political-expenses-tax-form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal group asks IRS to audit AFT teachers union's political spending</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE &mdash; A conservative legal group is accusing the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest teachers union, of misreporting funds used on political causes to the IRS and is requesting an audit of the organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Wednesday letter to the IRS, a copy of which was provided exclusively to the Washington Examiner, the Landmark Legal Foundation requested the tax collection agency investigate the teachers union for allegedly failing to report its expenses related to political advocacy properly on its annual tax forms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union, led by President Randi Weingarten, has been a fixture of Democratic Party politics for years. Weingarten often appears with Democratic political candidates at campaign rallies, and the union has a long and well-documented history of supporting liberal causes, along with Democratic politicians and political action committees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a 501(c)5 tax-exempt organization, the AFT must annually submit Form 990 to the IRS. The form asks organizations if they have "engage[d] in direct or indirect political campaign activities on behalf of or in opposition to candidates for public office" with a yes or no answer box.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union checked "no" in response to the form's question from 2016 to 2019, according to 990 forms reviewed by the legal group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complaint to the IRS alleges that Weingarten and the AFT used funds from the "general treasury" to pay for various political activities, including campaigning on behalf of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, as well as sponsoring an "AFT Votes" bus tour during the 2020 campaign that "mobilized the public to vote for identified candidates for public office."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filed complaint comes just weeks after President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes funding for the IRS to hire an additional 87,000 agents, a fact that Landmark Legal noted in its complaint in urging the agency to investigate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the Washington Examiner reported that the AFT raked in a record $196 million in 2021 membership fees based on a report from Americans for Fair Treatment, a public sector union watchdog group.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death claims for working-age adults under group life insurance policies spiked well beyond expected levels last summer and fall, according to data from 20 of the top 21 life insurance companies in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death claims for adults aged 35 to 44 were 100 percent higher than expected in July, August, and September 2021, according to a report by the Society of Actuaries, which analyzed 2.3 million death claims submitted to life insurance firms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report looked at death claims filed under group life insurance policies during the 24 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from April 2020 to March 2022. The researchers used data from the three years before the pandemic to set a baseline for the expected deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While COVID-19 played some role in the majority of the excess deaths for adults over the age of 34 during the two pandemic years, the opposite was true for younger people. For people 34 and younger, the number of excess non-COVID deaths was higher than those related to COVID, the data show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the third quarter of last year, deaths in the 25-to-34 age bracket were 78 percent above the expected level and, for people aged 45 to 54, 80 percent higher than expected. Excess mortality was 53 percent above the baseline for adults aged 55 to 64.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One life insurance company stated that it recorded COVID-19 as the cause of death only when it could be determined to be the primary cause of death on a death certificate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also notes that white-collar workers had the highest number of excess deaths during the two years studied. The group, which includes accountants, lawyers, computer programmers, and most other jobs done in an office setting, had 23 percent more deaths than expected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sharp increase of deaths among working-age people was first brought to light by Scott Davison, CEO of the Indianapolis-based life insurance company OneAmerica, who said in a virtual press conference on Dec. 30, 2021, that his company and the life insurance industry as a whole was seeing a 40 percent increase in deaths among people ages 18 to 64.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden on Sept. 9, 2021, mandated COVID-19 vaccines for federal employees and health care workers in facilities certified by Medicare and Medicaid. The same day, the president tasked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with implementing a nationwide vaccine mandate on private businesses with 100 or more employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign to vaccinate the majority of the population against COVID-19 is the largest vaccination campaign in the history of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Aug. 31, about 90 percent of Americans 18 or older had gotten at least the first dose of one of the COVID-19 vaccines, and 77 percent had gotten both a first and a second dose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Robert Malone, a physician and research scientist credited with the invention of the mRNA technology for use in vaccines, says excess mortality must always be studied to determine whether a vaccine or medicine really is safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Excess mortality should be a signal, a trigger,&rdquo; he told The Epoch Times. &ldquo;When we see excess mortality like that&mdash;basically if you&rsquo;re running a clinical trial and you see this kind of excess mortality, you stop the trial. And you investigate the cause before you proceed. And if you&rsquo;re marketing a drug, generally, with this kind of data, you stop the distribution of the drug until you have sorted it out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malone mentioned what he calls the &ldquo;classic example&rdquo; of thalidomide, a morning sickness medication prescribed to a small number of pregnant women in the United States in the late 1950s and early &rsquo;60s that was effective in treating morning sickness, but caused severe deformities in their unborn children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drug maker had pressured the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug, but the FDA refused, based on the deformities that had been reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cholesterol medication is another example, he added, saying cardiologists were convinced in the 1990s that cholesterol was the &ldquo;bad actor&rdquo; and that heart disease numbers would drop if it could be brought down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So they came out with some really good drugs for dropping cholesterol, and they ran the trials,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it clearly showed that they were effective in dropping cholesterol in humans, to a remarkable level, very, very effective. And everything was on track for approval, at those doses. And then the all-cause mortality data started coming in.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And paradoxically, people were dying, but they weren&rsquo;t dying of heart attacks. Their heart attack death rate was better. They were committing suicide, because when you pull cholesterol out of the brain, you trigger depression.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malone was a professor of pathology at the University of California&ndash;Davis and at the University of Maryland, where he had a lab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of COVID-19, he said, the CDC and FDA have been in denial about what all-cause mortality data show, in particular on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), where the government has only considered deaths that occur within 2 to 3 weeks of vaccination, based on the belief that the mRNA doesn&rsquo;t stay in the body for longer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he says, studies clearly show that this isn&rsquo;t true and the mRNA stays in the body for at least 60 days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government is required to study all-cause mortality for any drug or vaccine, says Malone, usually for a period of at least one year following approval. But there&rsquo;s no indication, he says, that they&rsquo;ve done this for the COVID-19 vaccines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The FDA basically threw away the rulebook, and let Fauci do whatever he wanted to do,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enoch Burke, a school teacher in Ireland, was banned from his school over his refusal to use the pronoun &ldquo;they&rdquo; for a student, then arrested for returning Monday, according to the Irish news website RTE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School suspended Burke from teaching while he underwent a disciplinary process for refusing to use the preferred pronouns of a student who identifies as transgender, which he said would violate his Christian beliefs, and a court issued an injunction temporarily barring him from teaching, according to RTE. Burke returned to the school anyways, and he was arrested and taken to prison.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I am a teacher and I don&rsquo;t want to go to prison,&rdquo; Burke said, according to the New York Post. &ldquo;I want to be in my classroom today, that&rsquo;s where I was this morning when I was arrested &hellip; I love my school, with its motto Res Non Verba, &lsquo;Actions not words,&rsquo; but I am here today because I said I would not call a boy a girl.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was initially suspended Aug. 24, and the court order came down Friday after he continued attending school anyways, according to RTE. He defied the court order blocking him from teaching Monday and told the court that it would violate his conscience to obey it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burke said in court that he loves his students and the subjects he teaches and that he didn&rsquo;t want to go to prison, but he couldn&rsquo;t violate his conscience by participating in the child&rsquo;s gender transition process, according to RTE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;To be clear, this teacher was jailed for breaching a court order, not for &lsquo;misgendering&rsquo;. But that court order barring him from the school because he refused to use &lsquo;they&rsquo; for a male student, should never have been granted IMO,&rdquo; author and commentator on transgender issues Helen Joyce wrote. &ldquo;Sinister and absurd.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation&rsquo;s request for comment.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There is something new under the sun&mdash;totalitarianism. Often confused with authoritarianism or tyranny, totalitarianism is a modern phenomenon, only possible in modernity. It is also uniquely deadly in its implications. So, what is it about modernity that makes totalitarianism feasible, and what makes it different from earlier forms of political oppression? The pugsters explore the modern character of totalitarianism on today&rsquo;s Pugcast.</p>

Joe, Nate, and Ryan discuss the recently published Frankfurt Declaration of Christian and Civil Liberties, and the relationship of the Cultural Mandate and Great Commission. In its most basic formulation, we tend to see Christians desiring to conform to culture or to escape culture, though the biblical calling is for God's saints to transform and build culture.</p>
