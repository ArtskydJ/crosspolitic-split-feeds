<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-pressure-banks-atone-slavery-era-activities-redress-past-wrongs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-pressure-banks-atone-slavery-era-activities-redress-past-wrongs</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats pressure banks to atone for slavery-era activities to 'redress past wrongs&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks should fund community development in Black communities, support the education of the next several generations of Black students and take other steps to atone for the role they played financing and supporting slavery in America, witnesses told a House committee hearing organized by Democrats on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on "The Role of Financial Institutions in the Horrors of Slavery and the Need for Atonement," which could be the final hearing led by Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., before Republicans take control of the House in January.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Darity, a professor of public policy at Duke University, said the slave trade was a major contributor to the growth of the U.S. financial sector, and said slavery is why Black families are so far behind White families when it comes to household net worth. Darity said a 2020 study says the average White household net worth is $840,000 higher than net worth for Black families and said bridging that gap would be expensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The collective amount required to close the disparity for approximately 40 million black American descendants of persons enslaved in the United States will come to at least $14 trillion," he said in his written testimony. "This is a sum that cannot be met reasonably by private donors or other levels of government."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other witnesses offered ideas on how banks can atone for their participation in the slave trade, which Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, contributed to the vast wealth of U.S. financial institutions that was "built on the backs of enslaved people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Sarah Federman, associate professor at the University of San Diego&rsquo;s Kroc School of Peace Studies, said financial institutions today still need to answer for their role in slavery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">education would be a "major contribution," along with supporting economic development in Black communities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dania Francis, assistant professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, said after slavery ended, Black farmers lost farmland that is worth more than $300 billion today. She said financial institutions should fund studies examining the role they played and commit "funding and resources to community development activities in Black communities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lily Roberts, acting vice president of the Inclusive Economy Center for American Progress, said banks should eliminate wage disparities between Black and White workers and create "programs to redress past wrongs."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/government/state-houses/hawaii-activates-national-guard-mauna-loa-eruption-lava-overflows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/government/state-houses/hawaii-activates-national-guard-mauna-loa-eruption-lava-overflows</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii activates National Guard as Mauna Loa lava nears major highway, pockets of natural gas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The continuing flow of lava from the eruption roughly nine days ago from Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano has now forced the island state to activate its National Guard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state's emergency management said Monday that 20 Hawaii National Guard service members were put on active duty to assist with traffic control and other roles in response to the Nov. 27 eruption.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Interior Department said lava flow is now just roughly two miles away from a major highway known as Saddle Road.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There continued to be several small overflows from main channels recorded over the past day," the federal agency said Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials previously said the volcano would likely be confined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lava advanced Monday at a rate of about 20 feet per hour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Though the advance rate has slowed over the past several days, the lava flow remains active with a continuous supply," the federal department also said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lava advance rates "may be highly variable" over the next several weeks, according to officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities warned that lava may flow into vegetated areas and create secondary fires or even cause methane explosions by igniting underground natural gas pockets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents are urged to take precautions against volcanic glass fragments, which are being blown hundreds of meters away from the eruption.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AOC under investigation by House Ethics Committee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is under a House Ethics investigation, a statement from the Ethics Committee revealed on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Acting Chairwoman and Acting Ranking Member of the Committee on Ethics have jointly decided to extend the matter regarding Representative Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, which was transmitted to the Committee by the Office of Congressional Ethics on June 23, 2022," the letter states. The acting chairwoman is Democrat Susan Wild (D) and the acting Ranking member is Michael Guest (R).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also states that the "fact of a referral or an extension and the mandatory disclosure of such an extension and the name of the subject of the matter, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement does not reveal why Ocasio Cortez is under investigation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York congresswoman has faced ethics complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics over allegations that she illegally funneled cash through a PAC to her boyfriend, the Washington Examiner reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This Complaint alleges Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez improperly converted U.S. House resources to her non-official, personal use by obtaining an official &lsquo;@mail.house.gov&rsquo; e-mail address for her boyfriend, despite the fact he was not employed by her congressional office,&rdquo; that complaint, from March of 2019, read. &ldquo;Moreover, it appears she obtained the e-mail address for him by falsely designating him a &lsquo;staff&rsquo; member."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AOC was also hit with an ethics complaint after she accepted a free ticket for the Met Gala in September of 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Accountability Foundation's Thomas Jones wrote in an ethics complaint that AOC broke House rules by accepting "an impermissible gift"</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn Youngkin moves to reimburse fines for violating Covid lockdown restrictions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced on Tuesday his plans to pay back the people and businesses who were fined by the state for violating Covid lockdown policies put in place by his predecessor, Democratic former Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an executive order, Youngkin commanded all state enforcement agencies, boards, and commissions, to report the fines and disciplinary actions they imposed upon those individuals and entities. According to an official statement, a reimbursement process is in the works for his upcoming budget proposal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also announced he will direct agencies to cease any further collection and enforcement of any lockdown-related fines, fees, or suspensions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am today requiring a statewide review of Covid-19-related penalties imposed by the Northam administration. The fact that businesses are still dealing with Covid-19 related penalties and fines is infuriating. Livelihoods are on the line," said Youngkin. "In the previous administration, we saw our government shut down businesses, close our schools, and separate us from each other. While we can't undo the damage done during the Northam administration, we are taking action going forward to end COVID-era draconian overreach."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor's office statement added that the fine reimbursements will not apply to instances where the violation was in relation to practices "intended to protect the health and safety of individuals, patients, residents, and staff of hospitals, nursing homes, certified nursing facilities, hospices, or assisted living facilities."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philly gas station hires armed guards to protect against theft</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner of a gas station in North Philadelphia got so fed up with the prevalence of violent crime in the city that he hired heavily armed security guards to protect his customers and store.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are tired of this nonsense," he says. "Robbery, drug trafficking, hanging around, gangs. They are forcing us to hire the security, high-level security, state level."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the theft of his ATM by a group of vandals, as well has the repeated vandalism of his car, Patel finally felt the need to hire security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ABC7 News, crime in Philadelphia has risen quite significantly in the last few years, with firearm robberies at gas stations in particular having tripled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney David Thiruselvam, whose clients are primarily victims of crime, says that he currently has nine people suing gas station after being shot on their premises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Pennsylvania law, owners are responsible for protecting customers from known dangers while on their property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the locals' opinions, the move worked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since hiring the security force three weeks ago, his business has not experienced any incidents of loitering or other crimes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-jack-dorsey-calls-on-elon-musk-to-make-everything-public-now?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-jack-dorsey-calls-on-elon-musk-to-make-everything-public-now?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Dorsey calls on Elon Musk to make 'everything public now'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey expressed to Elon Musk in a tweet on Wednesday that, for the sake of transparency, the Twitter Files be released to the public to "let people judge for themselves."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, documents of what action took place to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story are in the hands of journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss. The first round of files were revealed on Friday, with Taibbi providing a "Supplemental" on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dorsey said in his tweet: "If the goal is transparency to build trust, why not just release everything without filter and let people judge for themselves? Including all discussions around current and future actions? Make everything public now. #TwitterFiles"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several revelations have been made so far, with several chat logs being made public. The names of key players have been revealed, including former Trust and Safety Chief Yoel Roth, the recently fired Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker, and former head of legal, policy, and trust Vijaya Gadde.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taibbi's first thread on the Twitter files states explicitly that the vast amount of censorship was done "without the knowledge of CEO Jack Dorsey," and that situation was difficult to manage after Dorsey became involved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Musk revealed that Twitter has interfered with elections. It was in response to a report from Reuters about Twitter's move to free speech under Musk, he replied that "The obvious reality, as long-time users know, is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections. Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective, transparent and even-handed."</span></p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/4dfeab22-32f1-495f-8538-0168fac4ec5f/daily-news-brief-for-wednesday-december-7th-2022.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Wednesday, December 7th, 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I get to the news today, how about a little on this day in history?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 7, 1941, Japanese planes attacked the United States Naval Base at Pearl HarborExternal, Hawaii Territory, killing more than 2,300 Americans. The U.S.S. Arizona was completely destroyed and the U.S.S. Oklahoma capsized. A total of twelve ships sank or were beached in the attack and nine additional vessels were damaged. More than 160 aircraft were destroyed and more than 150 others damaged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hurried dispatch from the ranking United States naval officer in Pearl Harbor, Admiral Husband Edward Kimmel, Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, to all major navy commands and fleet units provided the first official word of the attack at the ill-prepared Pearl Harbor base. It said simply: AIR RAID ON PEARL HARBOR X THIS IS NOT DRILL.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following day, in an address to a joint session of Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt called December 7, 1941 &ldquo;a date which will live in infamy.&rdquo; Congress then declared War on Japan, abandoning the nation&rsquo;s isolationism policy and ushering the United States into World War II. Within days, Japan&rsquo;s allies, Germany and Italy, declared war on the United States, and the country began a rapid transition to a wartime economy by building up armaments in support of military campaigns in the Pacific, North Africa, and Europe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there ya go, a little history for you guys on this Wednesday morning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s start the news off with this:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vladimir-putin-bans-all-lgbt-propaganda-far-reaching-move"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vladimir-putin-bans-all-lgbt-propaganda-far-reaching-move</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vladimir Putin bans all 'LGBT propaganda' in far-reaching move</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation banning all LGBT "propaganda" on Sunday, according to Russian media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The far-reaching bill prohibits the creation or sharing of content depicting nontraditional sexual relations, gender reassignment and pedophilia in a positive lights, according to state-run media. The law reportedly extends to social media platforms, as well as mass media like films and advertisement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law also has a provision pertaining to minors and empowers to country's media watchdog to implement systems preventing minors from viewing such content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law went into effect the same day it was signed, on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putin has long waged a political war against the LGBT movement in Russia, and his allies have in the past cited the movement's success in the U.S. as an excuse for expansive actions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, who authored the bill, cited trends in the U.S. and Europe as a reason to pass it in November.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He cited data from opinion polls, according to which 16% of Europeans aged 14 to 29 identify themselves as LGBT," the Duma reported at the time. "And in the U.S. state of Maryland, the number of students who have not decided on their gender due to the promotion of non-traditional relationships has grown almost six times in two years and today makes up 45% of all students in the state."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Duma did not cite where it received the polls, and it was not immediately clear if the polls are in fact accurate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violations of the new law are mostly punished with fines, ranging from $800 for citizens infringing on the lowest tier to $160,000 for legal entities that infringe on the highest tier, which is pedophilia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now moving on to our stellar economy:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2022/12/06/u-s-trade-deficit-rises-5-4-to-four-month-high/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2022/12/06/u-s-trade-deficit-rises-5-4-to-four-month-high/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Trade Deficit Rises 5.4% to Four-Month High</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nation&rsquo;s trade deficit widened 5.4 percent in October to a four-month high of $78.2 billion, data from the Commerce Department showed Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was lower than expected. Economists had forecast the deficit would rise to around $80 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The October increase in the goods and services deficit reflected an increase in the goods deficit of $6.1 billion to $99.6 billion and an increase in the services surplus of $2.1 billion to $21.4 billion. The U.S. is typically a net exporter of services to the rest of the world and an importer of goods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far this year, the goods and services deficit is up $136.9 billion, or 19.9 percent, from the same period in 2021. Exports increased $415.3 billion or 19.8 percent. Imports increased $552.2 billion or 19.8 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic weakness around the globe, particularly in Europe, has softened demand for U.S. energy imports, including natural gas and petroleum products. Crude oil exports, however, grew by $1.6 billion. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation so the declines also reflected the recent weakening of the dollar against many other currencies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Exports of consumer goods were also lower, led by a decline in pharmaceuticals due to lower demand for drugs to treat or prevent infection of China&rsquo;s coronavirus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. spent more on imported cars and pharmaceuticals. Imports of cell phones, toys, games, and sports equipment slipped lower.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s check in on our southern border:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/06/ice-biden-immigration-border/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/06/ice-biden-immigration-border/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE Is Massively Misreporting How Many Illegal Immigrants Are Being Released With GPS Trackers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is significantly misreporting the number of illegal immigrants released into the country with GPS tracking technology by nearly 600%, according to an internal document exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE disclosed privately to participants of a closed-door event about the agency&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alternatives to Detention&rdquo; Thursday, attended by ICE Director Tae Johnson along with several agency officials and non-profits, that 8,118 illegal immigrants are monitored with GPS tracking through the program as of Nov. 14. Publicly, however, ICE says on its website that 56,805 illegal immigrants are monitored by GPS as of Nov. 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former ICE Chief of Staff Jon Feere, who now serves as director of investigations at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), believes that the Biden administration is seeking to appease groups that have fought ICE detention, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which was listed as an attendee at Thursday&rsquo;s event. The ACLU has a campaign on its website titled &ldquo;SHUT DOWN THE ICE DETENTION MACHINE,&rdquo; which encourages the public to email Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to urge ICE against any new detention contracts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program given to the Thursday event&rsquo;s attendees also showed that ICE underreported illegal immigrants without tracking technology by more than 18,000%, as previously reported by the DCNF. ICE disclosed to the attendees that as of Nov. 14 there are 49,459 illegal aliens that aren&rsquo;t monitored with any tracking equipment, while its own website says that as of Nov. 19 there are 266.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration continues to see record numbers of migrants illegally cross the southern border, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountering over 2.3 million in fiscal year 2022 and more than 230,000 in October.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How about a word from our friends across the pond?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/uk-government-approves-climate-lockdown-trials-for-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/uk-government-approves-climate-lockdown-trials-for-2024/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK Government Approves Climate Lockdown Trials for 2024</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents would be confined to their local neighborhood and would not be able to leave unless they requested permission from the government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the climate lockdown plan, the &rsquo;15 minute cities&rsquo; would place electronic gates on key roads in and out of the city, so the government would be instantly alerted by anyone trying to leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who request permission to leave their city would be profiled by the government, which would make a decision on whether to let that person out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new scheme, residents would be permitted to leave their zone a maximum of 100 days per year, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, every resident must register their car details with the government, enabling them to be tracked via smart cameras around the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Vision News reported:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oxfordshire County Council, which is run by Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party, secretly decided to divide up the city of Oxford into six &rsquo;15 minute&rsquo; districts in 2021 soon after they were elected to office. None of the councilors declared their intention of imprisoning local residents in their manifestos of course, preferring to make vague claims about how they will &lsquo;improve the environment instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every resident will be required to register their car with the County Council, which will then monitor how many times they leave their district via number plate recognition cameras. And don&rsquo;t think you can beat the system if you&rsquo;re a two-car household. Those two cars will be counted as one, meaning you will have to divide up the journeys between yourselves. 2 cars, 50 journeys each; 3 cars, 33 journeys each and so on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new rules, your social life becomes irrelevant. By de facto, Councils dictate how many times per year you can see friends and family. You will be stopped from fraternizing with anyone outside your district, and if you want a long-distance relationship in the future, forget it; you are confined to dating only those within a 15-minute walk of your house.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single person&rsquo;s life will be at the mercy of Communists in the central office, dictating the same draconian rules we had to avert the last crisis, a mild flu virus so deadly 80% of people didn&rsquo;t even know they had it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An entirely new social structure is being imposed on Oxford&rsquo;s residents ( and more cities are to follow) under the lie of saving the planet. but what it really is, is a plan for Command and Control. There will be permits, penalties and even more ubiquitous surveillance. Council officials will determine where you can go and how often, and will log every time you do. 15-minute cities, or 15 minute prisons?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an article on The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s website, &rsquo;15 minute&rsquo; cities are a powerful tool for action:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would Paris&rsquo;s Mayor Anne Hidalgo have pushed for progressive urban design without this framing? Undoubtedly. But with COVID-19 and its variants keeping everyone home (or closer to home than usual), the 15-minute city went from a &ldquo;nice-to-have&rdquo; to a rallying cry. Meeting all of one&rsquo;s needs within a walking, biking, or transit distance was suddenly a matter of life and death. The pandemic created an urgency around equitable urbanism that sidelined arguments about bike lanes and other &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; that have roiled communities for years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such calls for draconian measures to fight climate change are nothing new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020, the Red Cross declared climate change is a more significant threat than COVID, saying it should be confronted with &ldquo;the same urgency.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Bill Gates demanded dramatic measures to stop climate change, arguing it would be worse than the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said that climate deaths would dwarf those of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is the solution? More lockdowns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politicians and government know that fear helps the public to accept dramatic curtailing of freedoms, especially with vague promises of safety. The COVID lockdowns proved this. So now power-hungry bureaucrats can utilize the precedents for more comprehensive lockdowns in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, from California:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/california-english-teacher-says-proper-grammar-is-white-supremacist-refuses-to-teach-it?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/california-english-teacher-says-proper-grammar-is-white-supremacist-refuses-to-teach-it?utm_campaign=64487</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California English teacher says proper grammar is &lsquo;white supremacist,&rsquo; refuses to teach it</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A California high school English teacher claimed that she undermines "white supremacy" in her classroom by educating students about the overemphasis placed on writing rules and grammar usage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Fox News, as a tenured English teacher at Oroville High School, Marta Shaffer began this school year by teaching parts of linguistics as a way of "fighting white supremacy in my classes." She posted on TikTok that her goal was to be "inclusive of all kinds of ways we use the language."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1599466639740706816"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1599466639740706816</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schaffer said in another video obtained by the outlet that a student's "codes" &ndash; how they speak at home or with friends &ndash; is "just as important, if not more than important," than a boss's expectations of how their employee communicate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Just because your teachers, your professors, and your boss may expect you to write and speak in a certain way that may not be natural to you, does not mean that your more natural&hellip; languages are not important. They are just as important, if not more important than the &lsquo;language of respectability.&rsquo;"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schaffer said she feels like a "cringe white lady" when "teaching students of color" about linguistics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey something we can both agree on ms. schaffer!</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Upon a deeper observation, It seems like the Left has no qualms calling upon &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Word&rdquo; as their authority and advancing &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Kingdom&rdquo;. Yes their interpretations are contradictory of the Bible, but they do not seem to back down with their rhetoric&hellip; </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCP-linked hackers stole $20 MILLION in Covid benefits from US</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secret Service announced that hackers linked to the Chinese government stole at least $20 million in U.S. Covid relief funds, primarily those meant to help small businesses and unemployed Americans, NBC reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theft from the Chengdu-based hacking group which goes by the name APT41 is the first instance of pandemic fraud tied to a foreign government that the U.S. has publicly acknowledged, and it may just be the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret service declined to comment on any other potential instances of state-sponsored fraud, but said that there are more than 1,000 ongoing investigations into the stealing of Covid relief funds involving domestic and international cyber criminals, acknowledging that APT41 is "a notable player."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear at this point whether the Chinese government directed APT41 to commit this fraud or simply looked the other way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I've never seen them target government money before," the head of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, John Hultquist said. "That would be an escalation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secret Service considers APT41 to be a "Chinese state-sponsored, cyber threat group that is highly adept at conducting espionage missions and financial crimes for personal gain."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials believe that the primary purpose of state-sponsored groups like this is to gather sensitive information from American individuals, businesses, and institutions that could be used by the Chinese for espionage purposes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point in time, law enforcement officials and counterintelligence experts and almost certain that every American has had all or most of their personal data taken by the Chinese government in one way or another.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor Department Office of Inspector General has estimated that more than $160 billion of the $872.5 billion set aside for Federal pandemic unemployment funds has potentially been siphoned off by cybercriminals, though some individual states estimate higher amounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other estimates that put that number as high as $350 billion.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/european-country-considers-banning-electric-vehicle-travel-amid-energy-crisis-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/european-country-considers-banning-electric-vehicle-travel-amid-energy-crisis-report</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Country Considers Banning Electric Vehicle Travel Amid Energy Crisis: Report</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland is considering banning electric vehicles for non-essential travel this winter as the continent deals with an energy crisis sparked by Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Telegraph reported that government officials have already drafted plans to conserve energy that could include limiting heat in buildings to no more than 68 degrees Fahrenheit and reducing the number of hours stores can be open.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stricter measures could be enacted, including banning large indoor gatherings like sporting events, concerts, and theatre events, the report said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland relies heavily on hydroelectric power, which constitutes nearly two-thirds of its energy supply, the excess of which it exports during the time of year that it can generate the most electricity from rain and snowfall, the report said. It then typically is forced to import energy during the rest of the year as its nuclear resources, which it has been working to phase out, and its fossil fuel resources are not enough to meet demand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country has created a two-tier system for dealing with the energy shortage: emergency and crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in the &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; tier, there are three levels of restrictions, and in the &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; tier, there are two levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicles would face restrictions in the third level of the emergency tier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late August, officials in California unveiled a plan to phase out new gas-powered cars and days later asked residents to avoid charging their electric vehicles in the interest of not overwhelming the power grid during a heat wave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warnings of low grid capacity came days after the California Air Resources Board issued new rules requiring 35% of new vehicles to produce zero emissions by 2026 &mdash; a standard that will rise to a 68% benchmark by 2030 and a 100% level by 2035. Yet experts have warned that the state&rsquo;s electric grid will require significant upgrades to manage a rapid transition away from internal combustion vehicles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Today, most people charge their electric cars when they come home in the evening &mdash; when electricity demand is typically at its peak,&rdquo; according to researchers at Cornell University&rsquo;s College of Engineering. &ldquo;If left unmanaged, the power demanded from many electric vehicles charging simultaneously in the evening will amplify existing peak loads, potentially outstripping the grid&rsquo;s current capacity to meet demand.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/canada-offered-assisted-suicide-paralympian-veteran-wanted-wheelchair-lift-installed-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/canada-offered-assisted-suicide-paralympian-veteran-wanted-wheelchair-lift-installed-report</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada offered assisted suicide to a Paralympian veteran who wanted a wheelchair lift installed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada's Veterans Affairs office offered to assist a Paralympian and veteran to commit suicide when she sought to have a wheelchair lift installed in her home, the woman told lawmakers last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine Gauthier, a 52-year-old retired corporal who competed in the 2016 Paralympics at Rio De Janeiro, testified to lawmakers that a VA official had offered &mdash; in writing &mdash; to provide her with a medically-assisted suicide kit. The case officer remains unnamed but reportedly made similar offers to at least three other veterans, according to the Independent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I have a letter saying that if you&rsquo;re so desperate, madam, we can offer you MAID, medical assistance in dying," Gauthier said in a hearing before the House of Commons veterans affairs committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the incident in a public statement on Friday after Gauthier said she personally wrote him a letter on the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are following up with investigations and we are changing protocols to ensure what should seem obvious to all of us: that it is not the place of Veterans Affairs Canada, who are supposed to be there to support those people who stepped up to serve their country, to offer them medical assistance in dying," Trudeau said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada first approved medically-assisted suicide in 2016, and the parameters around allowing it have since loosened. The law originally legalized assisted suicide only for those facing imminent death, but it now also includes those who suffered severe pain or disabilities, according to the Independent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gauthier's story comes just weeks after a Canadian fashion company glorified assisted suicide in a commercial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian fashion company La Maison Simons promoted the "beauty" in voluntary euthanasia in a promotional video titled "All is Beauty." The ad includes a voiceover from Jennyfer Hatch, a 37-year-old Canadian woman who voluntarily euthanized herself after suffering from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simons says that the ad aimed to "help people to reconnect to each other and to this hope and optimism," which he says "is going to be needed if we're going to build the sort of communities and spaces where we want to live and that are enjoyable to live in."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The &lsquo;All is Beauty&rsquo; campaign has come to an end this week. Simons is now entering their annual holiday sprint," a spokesperson for Simons told Fox News Digital. "In this context, all of their teams' efforts are focused on in-store and web holiday activities."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-michael-avenatti-sentenced-to-168-months?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-michael-avenatti-sentenced-to-168-months?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Avenatti sentenced to 168 months</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti has been sentenced to 168 months in prison for four counts of wire fraud.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This 14 year sentence is in addition to the five years he is currently serving for other charges, including stealing almost $300,000 in book-advance money from his then-client Stormy Daniels</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Avenatti plead guilty to four counts of wire fraud and a single count of tax fraud, and admitted to misappropriating funds from clients totaling around $10 million.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his sentencing on Monday, Avenatti appeared solemn, often keeping his head down and hands in front if him while hearing statements from two of his victims, according to Law and Crime News' senior reporter Meghann Cuniff, who was documenting the proceedings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It is now time to pay his debts to the victims, the government and society," the Judge said, right before sentencing him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avenatti became widely known across the country as the lawyer representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in her failed lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, after it was revealed that she was paid $130,000 in hush money before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about an alleged sexual encounter she had with Trump years earlier</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the "creepy porn lawyer" by Tucker Carlson, Avenatti was the darling of the mainstream media for a time, seen as a hero "David" for going after "Goliath" Trump, before Avenatti's fall from grace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of 2021, he was also convicted of extortion after trying to get Nike to pay him $25 million that he claimed he was owed on behalf of a Los Angeles youth basketball team. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison and wept hysterically in response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of the numerous fraud charges against him, he also admitted to blocking IRS efforts to collect unpaid payroll taxes of an estimated $5 million, include payroll taxes that had been withheld from employee paychecks of a Tully's Coffee operated by an Avenatti-owned company.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man thrown over the side of a bridge after Chargers game in wild incident caught on video says his attacker has still not been arrested by police</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man who was caught on video being thrown over the side of a footbridge while exiting a Los Angeles Chargers on November 20th is speaking out, blasting police for not arresting his attacker and saying he no longer feels safe attending games at SoFi Stadium.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, the man, who has been identified as Austin Willenbring, can be seen in a shoving altercation with some unknown individuals, who eventually lift him up and throw him over the side of the bridge railing to a concrete walkway below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, the men can be seen then dragging Willenbring to the railing before throwing him over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willenbring says that he suffered serious injuries as a result of his fall, including a concussion and broken ribs. Even still, he says that he and his sister were able to track down and identify the men who had thrown him over the railing, and even though they were able to make a positive ID to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies, and had video of the entire incident, police refused to make an arrest. WCAL also reports that there is no record that the man identified by Willenbring has yet been arrested by police or charged with any crime in connection with the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inglewood police told WCAL they are "still investigating" the incident, and Inglewood mayor James Butts defended the city's response to the incident, saying, "Here's the reality: When you have hundreds of thousands of people in one place, when you have alcohol involved, you're gonna have fights. It's an unfortunate fact of life. We have to put things in perspective, six million patrons in three years, three altercations."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willenbring says that he plans to cancel his season ticket package because he no longer feels safe going to games.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome, Neighbor! We're continuing our rebroadcast of John's first podcast episodes, ever.&nbsp; This is the Comedy Sojourn Episode #2, originally published in September 2016.&nbsp; Please forgive the audio issues. We were rubes back then... (Not like now--because these days we always get our audio equipment to work perfectly.)</p>
<p>Andrew and Tabby are John's two youngest children, and they have a lot to say about a spider they caught.&nbsp; Should they kill it or catch-and-release?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode:</p>
<p>"You could get eight really good drumsticks from that spider." --John Branyan</p>
<p>"We have butts, and we can't spin webs...cigarettes have butts, and they can't spin webs."</p>
<p>Tabby is getting married later this week, but she won't come back to visit if Dad and Andrew let the spider go in the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...Did you know, Dad, that some turtles breathe out of their butts?" --Tabby (Branyan) Farkas</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; John and the Peaches talk about the Atheist Hospice Care Worker.&nbsp; (With just a few interruptions from young girls with noisy toys.)&nbsp; How can an Atheist assign value to end-of-life care?</p>
<p>Quote from The Way of the Heathen: "We matter because we matter to each other in our own short time on our own short scale...we make each other important."</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>On this week's episode of OPEN MIKE, Mike has the pleasure of sitting down with Pastor Tobias Riemenschneider of the <em>Evangelical-Reformed Baptist Church in Frankfurt</em> (<a href="https://erb-frankfurt.de/leitung-der-kirche/">https://erb-frankfurt.de/leitung-der-kirche/</a>) and author of the&nbsp;<em>Frankfurt Declaration</em>. In it, they talk about the Lordship of Jesus Christ over all of life and how that affects all the various spheres of authority in life and the stunning reality that Germany strictly enforces a Nazi law forbidding homeschooling.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/yellen-blames-americans-splurging-pandemic-record-high-inflation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/yellen-blames-americans-splurging-pandemic-record-high-inflation</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Janet Yellen blames Americans' 'splurging' for record-high inflation</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen blamed consumers' excessive spending habits as a primary cause for the near 40-year-high in inflation on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden official appeared on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," where she was asked about the price increases that have plagued the U.S. for more than a year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colbert asked her to explain to his audience how inflation got out of hand when "two years ago everything seemed fine." The late-night host, known for his sycophantic boosting of President Biden and Democrats, even noted the Biden administration dismissed inflation as a "small risk" as recently as last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen argued the administration managed the COVID-19 pandemic so well that consumers felt comfortable to "splurge" on goods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YEgj_Svh78"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Is The U.S. Headed For A Recession? Sec. Janet Yellen Gives Her Outlook&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YEgj_Svh78&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Is The U.S. Headed For A Recession? Sec. Janet Yellen Gives Her Outlook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play 0:55-3:48</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no mention during the remarks about multitrillion-dollar spending bills that have been passed and signed during Biden's administration. She also isn't the only White House official who's blamed inflation on Americans spending recklessly or who has dismissed economic concerns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House chief of staff Ron Klain was mocked for suggesting rising costs and supply chain issues were a "high class" problem last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was also criticized for laughing at rising gas prices and offering Americans tax credits for installing solar panels on their homes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberal journalists like MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle have also argued consumers could afford to spend more money on groceries and utilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4% from September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite prices still being near the 40-year high, Biden told a reporter last month that the economy was "strong as hell."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/ny-democrats-want-taxpayers-to-shell-out-300m-to-help-illegal-migrants-avoid-deportation-we-have-a-moral-obligation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/ny-democrats-want-taxpayers-to-shell-out-300m-to-help-illegal-migrants-avoid-deportation-we-have-a-moral-obligation</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NY Democrats want taxpayers to shell out $300M to help illegal migrants avoid deportation: &lsquo;We have a moral obligation&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Albany Democrats, originally from New York City, are pushing for a bill to cover the legal fees of illegal immigrants battling deportation, which would cost taxpayers roughly $300 million, the New York Post reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manhattan Senator Brad Hoylman (D) and Queens Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz (D) support the legislation despite estimates that it will require a $55 million down payment in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the legislation are pushing for New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) to support the proposal and commit to $100 million in funding from the state&rsquo;s budget. On Wednesday, the governor committed to providing $3 million to nonprofit organizations assisting immigrants with their asylum applications.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics of the bill expressed concern that the legal defense could help potentially &ldquo;dangerous people&rdquo; remain in the United States and hurt public safety. Those opposed to the measure also cited budget concerns and noted that New York City is already estimated to spend $1 billion on costs related to the influx of migrants arriving in the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would cover legal defense costs for any incarcerated immigrant, regardless of the criminal convictions that initiated their removal proceedings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Assembly Minority Leader William Barclay of Pulaski stated, &ldquo;Democrats&rsquo; complete failure on border security and immigration shouldn&rsquo;t result in a $300 million tax on New Yorkers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Last year, New York City&rsquo;s radical Democrats wanted non-citizens to vote in local elections,&rdquo; Barclay continued. &ldquo;Now they expect the public to spend hundreds of millions to provide free deportation lawyers. Their political statements do not need to be contained in the state spending plan.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/government/congress/gop-senators-withhold-support-defense-funding-until-they-get-vote-end-military"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/government/congress/gop-senators-withhold-support-defense-funding-until-they-get-vote-end-military</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP senators to withhold support for Defense funding until they get vote to end military vax mandate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven GOP senators made the vow Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference, saying they would withhold the support if leaders of the Democrat-led chamber don't allow a floor vote on their proposal, according to NBC News.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said the group will not vote to get on the NDAA "unless we have a vote on ending this military vaccine mandate."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The libertarian-mined Paul typically votes against the act every year and is among the most critical in his conference about the federal government's handling of the pandemic, including mandated vaccinations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senators' effort could delay final passage of the annual bill, which Congress has consistently passed, but it would not prevent the Senate from eventually voting on the legislation, NBC also reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other six are Sens. Mike Braun, of Indiana; Ted Cruz, of Texas; Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin; Mike Lee, of Utah; and Rick Scott, of Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham says military recruitment had suffered as a result of vaccination requirements that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made mandatory last year for all service members. The requirement applies to all active duty and Ready Reserve service members including the National Guardsmen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/30/florida-school-boards-oust-superintendents-mask-mandates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/30/florida-school-boards-oust-superintendents-mask-mandates/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida School Boards Flip Red, Immediately Oust Superintendents Who Oversaw Mask Mandates</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two school boards with conservative majorities parted ways with their schools&rsquo; superintendents in November, both of whom oversaw the implementation of mask mandates into the fall of 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 29, Sarasota County Schools Superintendent Brennan Asplen agreed to step down after the school board criticized mask mandates which Asplen backed, while on Nov. 22 Brevard County Superintendent Mark Mullins, who faced backlash for supporting an extended mask mandate, agreed with the school board to enter into separation negotiations. Both school districts extended their mask mandates into the fall of the 2021-2022 school year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2021-2022 school year, Brevard Public Schools extended its emergency mask mandate through Nov. 28, giving parents an opt-out option, according to the school website. Sarasota County Schools implemented a mask mandate in August 2021 but it was repealed in October, according to the Herald-Tribune.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who endorsed recently elected members who flipped the school board majorities, signed an executive order in July 2021 requiring schools to give parents to opt their students out of school&rsquo;s mask mandates. The order came in response to schools implementing mask mandates in 2020, according to a press release by the governor&rsquo;s office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asplen, who took over in 2020, called the board&rsquo;s citing of his COVID-19 response &ldquo;ridiculous.&rdquo; School Board Chair Bridget Ziegler noted that the relationship between the board and the superintendent was broken.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moves by the Florida school boards come after the Berkeley County School Board in South Carolina, which flipped to a conservative majority, fired the school superintendent as well as the district&rsquo;s lawyer, banned Critical Race Theory from the classroom and set up a committee to review material flagged for pornographic content in its first meeting since being elected.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ccp-announces-they-will-ease-covid-restrictions-in-key-cities-amid-white-paper-protests?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ccp-announces-they-will-ease-covid-restrictions-in-key-cities-amid-white-paper-protests?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCP announces they will ease Covid restrictions in key cities amid White Paper Protests</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese city of Guanzhao has begun to ease Covid restrictions that have been in service to the nation's "zero Covid" policy, "announcing the lifting of all lockdowns," reports state-affiliated media outlet Hu Xijin. Lifting of Covid restrictions has been called something of a surrender, that the CCP is "throwing in the white flag."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Beijing has been gradually lifting lockdowns over the past few days," Hu Xijin futher reports. "Vice Premier Sun Chunlan on Wed formally noted the virus' weakening pathogenicity for the first time...China is speeding up to cast aside large-scale lockdowns." Officials in Zhengzhao, where Apple's Foxconn factory is located, announced an "orderly" return to business, opening supermarkets, gyms and restauarants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The southwestern city of Chongqing will allow the close-contacts of people with COVID-19, who fulfil certain conditions, to quarantine at home," Al-Jazeera reports. However, they also report that President Xi is unlikely to remove further restrictions, as Covid case counts are still reportedly at record levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes after the country has seen days of protests against Covid restrictions and lockdowns. The protests began after a fire in an apartment building in the city of Urumqi, which took the lives of 10, including a 3-year-old child.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is widely believed that firefighters were delayed in putting out the blaze due to lockdown restrictions which made it harder to gain access to the building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protests are the largest public display of anti-government behavior since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The protests also come shortly after the coronation of Xi Jinping at the national congress, essentially making the president leader of the country for life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CCP has been aggressive in their attempts to stop the White Paper Revolution protestors, who hold up white sheets of paper to oppose censorship. Apple has appeared to help the CCP, restricting the use of their AirDrop feature, which iPhone users can use to bypass the internet and internet censors and communicate phone to phone. Protests at the Foxconn Apple factory in Zhengzhao were squashed last week as the CCP instituted Covid restrictions to keep people locked down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country has been imposing mass testing requirements, separating family members who test positive, including young children. These restrictions and limitations have generated increasing anger in the Chinese populace, and Covid has continued to spread, despite these measures.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tom-brady-could-end-up-new-england-this-offseason-patriots-insider-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tom-brady-could-end-up-new-england-this-offseason-patriots-insider-says</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Brady could end up in New England this offseason, Patriots insider says</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Tom Brady reunion in New England?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Athletic&rsquo;s Jeff Howe, who has covered the Patriots for more than a decade, said, "Don&rsquo;t ever write off the Patriots," in a recent article that broke down where the veteran quarterback might play next season if he decides he wants to return for a 24th campaign in the NFL.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like Brady was forever done wearing red, white and navy blue when he moved on to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and ended up winning a Super Bowl there. But, as he&rsquo;s set to be a free agent once again after this season, Howe believes a reunion could be in the cards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howe added that no "egos" or "pride" would get in the way of Brady returning if it came down to that. Instead, the offensive play-calling under Matt Patricia would be questioned by Brady to make sure that he wouldn&rsquo;t be wasting his 24th season, considering that his days in the league are numbered (or so we all thought after he retired then decided not to in the same offseason).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on the Patriots&rsquo; end, they would also like to know what Brady plans to do. If it&rsquo;s a year-to-year decision, they may be less likely to want a reunion, especially after Mac Jones, the team&rsquo;s current starter, was drafted in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft to be their quarterback of the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones has played well, but Belichick has the obvious winning history with Brady. Howe doesn&rsquo;t think the Pats would even have to trade Jones because he&rsquo;s still under a lengthy, cheap rookie deal and could learn a lot from Brady.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, it&rsquo;s an option and pure speculation at this point because no one knows for sure if Brady will truly hang up the cleats for good after this season with the Bucs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howe also mentioned the San Francisco 49ers &mdash; Brady grew up a fan of them in San Mateo, California &mdash; the Tennessee Titans and the Las Vegas Raiders as potential destinations other than returning to Tampa Bay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This season, Brady hasn&rsquo;t seen the same offensive firepower he did in his first two seasons with the Bucs, as Bruce Arians' departure seems to have left a void. His offensive line troubles also haven&rsquo;t helped matters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers sit in first place in a dreadful NFC South at 5-6, with the Atlanta Falcons behind them at 5-7.</span></p>

<p>The conference featured many of the courageous pastors and congregants who stood up to the covid tyranny, kept the doors to their churches open and were fined and imprisoned for it. On top of the wonderful time sharing the word and encouraging like-minded brothers, the new documentary &ldquo;Of Anti-Christ and his Ruin&rdquo; was featured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P Nate, #1 and Air-Jordan weigh in on the conference, the doc and what they took away.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/house-passes-biden-backed-bill-avert-rail-strike"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/house-passes-biden-backed-bill-avert-rail-strike</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House passes Biden-backed bill to avert rail strike</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to avert a national railroad strike, but questions remain about whether the effort can clear the 50-50 Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By an 290-137 vote, House lawmakers voted to pass legislation blocking nearly 100,000 railroad workers from striking in early December. Economists and the White House have warned that a railroad strike could paralyze the nation's economy ahead of the holiday season.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We must act to prevent a catastrophic strike that would touch the lives of nearly every family," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation gives unionized train engineers and conductors three unpaid sick days a year for medical appointments, provided employers are given at least 30 days' notice about the time off. It's based on an agreement that railroad companies and transportation unions agreed to in September. While eight unions have already adopted the agreement, four have not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standoff between the holdout unions and railroad companies has failed to resolve itself even as White House officials have become increasingly involved. President Biden said the failure to achieve a breakthrough forced him to ask Congress to intervene and prevent a strike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressives have lambasted Biden's decision to ask Congress to intervene. Far-left lawmakers, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., say Biden's request for Congress to approve legislation blocking nearly 100,000 railroad workers from striking was inappropriate given the unions were still pushing for broader paid sick leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House on Wednesday also passed a separate bill 221-207 giving railroad workers an additional seven days of sick leave. It remains to be seen if it will be included in the version the 50-50 divided Senate will take up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the upper chamber, at least 10 Republican votes are needed for the legislation to overcome a filibuster, provided all 50 Democrats fall in line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s keep it within the Biden administration shall we?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-non-binary-nuclear-official-charged-stealing-womans-luggage-airport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-non-binary-nuclear-official-charged-stealing-womans-luggage-airport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-binary Biden nuclear official charged with stealing woman's luggage at airport</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Brinton, a senior Energy Department (DOE) official, was charged with stealing a traveler's luggage in the Minneapolis airport in September, shortly before quietly taking a leave of absence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brinton &mdash; who serves as the DOE's deputy assistant secretary for spent fuel and waste disposition &mdash; allegedly took a Vera Bradley suitcase worth $2,325 from the luggage carousel at the Minneapolis St. Paul Airport (MSP) on Sept. 16, according to a criminal complaint filed on Oct. 26 in Minnesota state court and obtained by Fox News Digital. Brinton had traveled from Washington, D.C., to MSP that day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the suitcase's owner alerted police, officers reviewed video surveillance of the carousel and identified Brinton taking the luggage before removing its tag identifying the owner, the court filings stated. Law enforcement observed Brinton using the luggage during at least two other trips to Washington, D.C., on Sept. 18 and Oct. 9.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, on Oct. 9, Brinton denied stealing anything when a police officer called to discuss the incident. Brinton confirmed still possessing the suitcase.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"If I had taken the wrong bag, I am happy to return it, but I don&rsquo;t have any clothes for another individual," Brinton told the officer. "That was my clothes when I opened the bag."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two hours after the phone call, Brinton called the officer back and apologized for not being "completely honest." But Brinton said it was a mistake and blamed being tired for taking the wrong bag at the carousel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"DEFENDANT said when they opened the bag at the hotel, they realized it was not theirs," the court filings stated.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanye Canceled &mdash; by Kanye; Walks Out of Tim Pool Interview When Asked to Defend His Antisemitism</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanye West, the rapper and entrepreneur who has become infamous for his antisemitic views, walked out of an interview Monday evening with podcaster Tim Pool the moment the host mildly challenged his views on Jews.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1597401435549110272"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1597401435549110272</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interview, which was streamed live on YouTube, included Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulous, who has recently joined West&rsquo;s entourage and nascent 2024 presidential campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pool allowed West to express his views, largely uninterrupted, for the first fifteen minutes of the broadcast. He claimed that his recent, controversial dinner with former President Donald Trump had been scheduled last month &mdash; apparently before West began making antisemitic comments such as the infamous &ldquo;death con&rdquo; tweet. The dinner was postponed until after the midterm elections; West confirmed that Trump did not know Fuentes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West claimed that it was &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; that people could see how Jews &mdash; whom he referred to as &ldquo;Zionists&rdquo; at one stage &mdash; cancel people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luke Rudkowski, one of Pool&rsquo;s co-hosts, said that West said as he was leaving: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in my truths.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Census: Christians a Minority in England; Non-religious Grow</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fewer than half the people in England and Wales consider themselves Christian, according to the most recent census &mdash; the first time the country's official religion has been followed by a minority of the population.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain has become less religious &mdash; and less white &mdash; in the decade since the last census, figures from the 2021 census released Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 46.2% of the population of England and Wales described themselves as Christian on the day of the 2021 census, down from 59.3% a decade earlier. The Muslim population grew from 4.9% to 6.5% of the population, while 1.7% identified as Hindu, up from 1.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 1 in 3 people &mdash; 37% &mdash; said they had no religion, up from 25% in 2011.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other parts of the U.K., Scotland and Northern Ireland, report their census results separately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secularism campaigners said the shift should trigger a rethink of the way religion is entrenched in British society. The U.K. has state-funded Church of England schools, Anglican bishops sit in Parliament's upper chamber, and the monarch is "defender of the faith" and supreme governor of the church.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Copson, chief executive of the charity Humanists U.K., said "the dramatic growth of the non-religious" had made the U.K. "almost certainly one of the least religious countries on Earth."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, one of the most senior clerics in the Church of England, said the data was "not a great surprise," but was a challenge to Christians to work harder to promote their faith.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have left behind the era when many people almost automatically identified as Christian, but other surveys consistently show how the same people still seek spiritual truth and wisdom and a set of values to live by," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 82% of people in England and Wales identified as white in the census, down from 86% in 2011. Some 9% said they were Asian, 4% Black and 3% from "mixed or multiple" ethnic backgrounds, while 2% identified with another ethnic group.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESPN Host Stephen A. Smith Apologizes For Using The Term &ldquo;Homosexual&rdquo; While Discussing Profanity-Laced Lamar Jackson Tweet</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson took offense at Twitter user CastleWillKill sharing his opinion that the Baltimore Ravens should let him walk rather than pay him $250 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CastleWillKill tweeted, &ldquo;When someone is asking for over 250 mil guaranteed like Lamar Jackson &hellip; games like this should not come to Justin Tucker. Let Lamar walk and spend that money on a well rounded team.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamar Jackson responded with a profanity laced tweet, to which Stephen A. Smith responded to, like so:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by Awful Announcing, Smith would later apologize for using the term &ldquo;homosexual&rdquo; while discussing Jackson&rsquo;s tweet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is absolutely no reason to apologize for using the term homosexual over gay. In fact, Smith should have used the word Sodomite instead.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This week&rsquo;s Pugcast presents a rich conversation with Dr. Michael Hanby, Associate Professor of Religion and Philosophy of Science at the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family at the Catholic University of America. Dr. Hanby has been at the forefront of cultural analysis with works critically engaging modern science and sociology, unmasking their problematic theological and philosophical underpinnings, unpacking the cultural havoc such underpinnings have resulted in. In view of his recent talk at the Touchstone Conference, The Politics of Nothingness, where Dr. Hanby digs deeply into the flood of causes which have led to the present crises in our culture, the Pugsters have a deep conversation with Dr. Hanby, especially about the important work of Augusto Del Noce on the Problem of Atheism. This conversation is a real treat!</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Wednesday, November 30th, 2022. Happy hump day everyone! I hope y&rsquo;all have been having a good week&hellip; and before we get to the news, do you want your kids to be able to take on our wicked culture, and be dangerous? Look no further than NSA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Saint Andrews:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&rsquo;s culture shifts like sand. But New Saint Andrews College is established on Christ, the immovable rock. It is a premier institution that forges evangelical leaders who don&rsquo;t fear or hate the world. Guided by God&rsquo;s Word, they take the world back because they&rsquo;re equipped with the genius of classical liberal arts and God-honoring wisdom, thanks to a faculty dedicated to academic rigor and to God&rsquo;s kingdom.Find out more, at nsa.edu/</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHITE PAPER REVOLUTION SPREADS: Anti-CCP protests break out worldwide as Chinese students demonstrate in key cities</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following days of ongoing protests in China, the "White Paper Revolution" has spread outside of the country, with protestors across the globe, many of Chinese descent, standing in solidarity with those in China protesting their country&rsquo;s "Zero Covid" policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, college students at University of California Berkeley, NYU, and Columbia University gathered on their campuses, carrying white sheets of paper as those in China have been doing. The blank, white pages are a symbol of protest against Chinese censors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Berkeley, students set up a candlelight vigil for the victims of a fire in a Urumqi apartment building. At least 10 people died in the fire after months of a strict Covid lockdown saw residents locked inside of their homes by officials. Lockdowns were blamed for the inability of fire fighters to put out the blaze fast enough, in which a 3-year-old was among the casualties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protestors on Berkeley&rsquo;s campus set fire to a masked Winnie the Pooh stuffed animal, representing Chinese President Xi Jinping.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students from NYU gathered in New York City&rsquo;s Washington Square Park to protest in solidarity with Chinese citizens stepping up in their own country, setting up another candlelight vigil.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protestors in the square chanted "no lockdown, but freedom. No lies, but dignity. No Cultural Revolution, but reform. No supreme leaders, but votes. No slaves, but citizens. Twitter user Indy posted the footage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Columbia University in New York City, protestors used facemasks to cover the face of a statue that sits iconically before the schools largest library.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protestors held a banner that read, "Chinese Community Party, Step Down! Give Me Liberty of Death!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrations were also seen in Tokyo, Japan, with Chinese students protesting outside of the city&rsquo;s Chinese Embassy while holding white sheets of paper.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In London, England, protestors chanted "down with the party, down with Xi Jinping, Free China," flying the flag of East Turkestan, the region of China where the apartment fire broke out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protests had sparked in China following the Urumqi apartment fire last week. Chinese citizens took to the streets in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing in opposition of the country&rsquo;s "Zero Covid" policy, which issues strict restrictions for those found to be positive for the virus, including separating them from those who test negative, like family members.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis SLAMS Apple as 'vassal of the CCP' after it limits AirDrop on Chinese iPhones</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple has beed accused of being vassals for the Chinese Communist Party by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis after the tech giant restricted its AirDrop feature amid White Paper Revolution protests breaking out across the country. Chinese citizens are demonstrating against the CCP's lockdown policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The criticism comes as Apple and Google consider pulling Twitter from their respective app stores in response to owner Elon Musk's new free speech policies, which include dropping restrictions around so-called Covid disinformation. They have been encouraged to do so by some American journalists, including those at the Washington Post. Musk has said he is a free speech absolutist, and believes the platform should be open to discourse and should not engage in censorship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AirDrop feature is a vital tool for those in authoritarian countries, as the feature uses direct connections between phones rather than using any internet signal to communicate. On November 9, Apple released its new iOS. The update made it so that iPhones sold in mainland China can only receive messages from people for just 10 minutes before the function stops working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. DeSantis made several comments about China during a media appearance on Tuesday, where he accused Apple of being a "vassal of the CCP," and warned that "nuking" Twitter off the app store would be anti-free speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v1xw06a-desantis-slams-apple-for-being-a-vassal-of-the-ccp..html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v1xw06a-desantis-slams-apple-for-being-a-vassal-of-the-ccp..html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, Musk said that he was prepared to "go to war" with Apple over the prospect it pulling the app. In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk said that it is a "real problem" that Apple and Google "effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protests in China have raged on across several cities in respose to extreme measures taken by the CCP under President Xi Jinping. On Monday, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby was asked why the Biden administration had not responded more strongly in support of the ongoing people's protests in China against that country's authoritarian regime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirby said, "We're watching this closely as you might expect, we would. And again, we continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest. And I think we're gonna watch this closely and we'll see where things go."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirby said that President Biden would not be speaking on behalf of protestors, and that the protestors are "speaking for themselves."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Big Tech:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, YouTube spend MILLIONS to launch Global Fact Check Fund</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Google and YouTube announced that they will be providing a $13.2 million grant to the nonprofit Poynter Institute's International Fact Checking Network with the goal of launching a new "Global Fact Check Fund," set to launch in early 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move, which marks the companies' largest fact-checking grant to date, comes as they continue to ramp up their fight against "misinformation" online.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Google and YouTube, the grant will "support [the Poynter Institute's] network of 135 fact-checking organizations from 65 countries covering over 80 languages."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The companies justified their decision by noting that "helping people to identify misinformation is a global challenge."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Global Fact Check Fund," they explained, "will help fact-checkers to scale existing operations or launch new ones that elevate information, uplift credible sources and reduce the harm of mis- and disinformation around the globe."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations are expected to use the funding to "incorporate new technologies, create or expand digital footprints, optimize verification tools, and increase their capacities to deepen audience engagement through innovative storytelling formats such as audio, video, or podcasts."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The world needs fact-checking more than ever before," IFCN executive director Baybars &Ouml;rsek said. "This partnership with Google and YouTube infuses financial support to global fact-checkers and is a step in the right direction, and while there&rsquo;s much work to be done, this partnership has sparked meaningful collaboration and an important step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, investments in programs aimed at tackling mis- and disinformation online have grown in tandem with peoples' interest and awareness in the subject.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from Google, in October 2022, interest in mis- and disinformation across the world reached its highest point since 2004, when records began, with the most pressing topic being the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, big tech's fact-checking apparatus went into overdrive as companies struggled to keep up with information that seemed to be changing on a daily, if not hourly basis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube has been criticized for its crackdowns on those who shared ideas that opposed the mainstream, many of whom have had their views vindicated in the months since.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden rushing to track the $20 billion we gave Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans, who are poised to take control of the House in January, have promised to audit the immense amount of money our Congress has been shipping off to fight another country&rsquo;s war. Among the goals of the audit would be determining how much of the money ended up in the &ldquo;wrong hands&rdquo; as previous tracking efforts proved the Biden administration only inspected a small fraction of the funds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are not without allies across the aisle in this effort. As it turns out, there are still a few, truly and consistently, anti-war folks left on the Democrat&rsquo;s bench who share the GOP&rsquo;s concern over our involvement in this conflict.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The taxpayers deserve to know that investment is going where it&rsquo;s intended to go,&rdquo; Rep. Jason Crow, D (CO), said. &ldquo;In any war, there can be missteps and misallocation of supplies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to reports, only 10% of the 22,000 weapons the US gave Ukraine between February and November 1 have been inspected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The threats of an audit have led to a lot of handwringing by warmongers in both parties, as well as overseas. Members of Parliament have worried out loud that these investigations may lead to the US cutting its funding to Ukraine altogether&hellip;which would be, umm, ideal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we should absolutely not be involved in this proxy war that is threatening global peace, spurring an energy crisis, and deepening the recession many countries including our own are experiencing, a basic audit of the funds is the bare minimum here. It is outrageous that we&rsquo;re sending billions of dollars to this cause at all, much less without any idea how they are being utilized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Congressional leaders, namely Rand Paul, have been working to mandate such oversight for some time and have largely been opposed by both Republican and Democrats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enter a war, the US is supposed to require a vote by all members of Congress. That hasn&rsquo;t happened in over two decades while, at the same time, we have invested trillions of taxpayer dollars and given up thousands of American lives involving ourselves in conflicts that don&rsquo;t pertain to us and that the American people never got to vote on.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monkeypox Gets Canceled: WHO Says Name is Racist, Changes It to &lsquo;Mpox&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what seems to be another foray into left wing &ldquo;logic,&rdquo; the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Monday that they would no longer use the term &ldquo;monkeypox&rdquo; because of &ldquo;racist and stigmatizing language&rdquo; over usage of the term.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHO released a statement which read in part, &ldquo;Following a series of consultations with global experts, WHO will begin using a new preferred term &lsquo;mpox&rsquo; as a synonym for monkeypox. Both names will be used simultaneously for one year while &lsquo;monkeypox&rsquo; is phased out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend of renaming diseases is not a new one. Political correctness was front and center for WHO as far back as 2015 when they released &ldquo;Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Diseases.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, WHO stated that new disease names should be assigned, &ldquo;with the aim to minimize unnecessary negative impact of disease names on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare, and avoid causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An earlier announcement was made in June after approximately thirty scientists declared there was, &ldquo;urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing nomenclature for the monkeypox virus.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration, in their never ending search for perfect political correctness compliance, had already privately urged a name change, arguing that calling it monkeypox could be hampering vaccination efforts.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NHL Denies The Truth And Reality, Embraces And Promotes Transgender Idol Worship</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Hockey League made it abundantly clear they now worship at the altar of transgenderism when they recently declared that they deny reality by claiming that men can become women and women can become men.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization posted to Twitter their support of a Team Trans Draft Tournament that was held in Middleton, Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They wrote, &ldquo;The NHL is proud to support this past weekend&rsquo;s Team Trans Draft Tournament in Middleton, Wisconsin. This was the first tournament comprised entirely of transgender and nonbinary players, with around 80 folks participating!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization took it a step further when they responded to a user who asked, &ldquo;So, men playing on womans team?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The league responded, &ldquo;Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Nonbinary identity is real.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tweet and the celebration of the tournament are not only a denial of reality, they are promoting other people to embrace in this denial of reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This statement of idol worship comes a little over a month after the NHL embraced anti-white racism where they claimed in their Accelerating Diversity &amp; Inclusion report that the organization&rsquo;s teams are too white. In order to address what they view as a problem they revealed plans to reduce the percentage of white people that work for them.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welp, there you go&hellip; hockey is dead. What do you make of the NHL worshiping at the altar of transgenderism and encouraging others to join in their idolatry?</span></p>

<p>Ezra Institute Fellow Dr. James White joins us this week to talk about the Protestant fascination with Aquinas, and the path that leads from Thomism to Roman Catholicism. Dr. White explains some of the reasons why Protestants are induced to follow Thomas, the fundamental issue of authority that is at stake, and what Thomas would have thought of the current Pope.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of tyranny&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/clashes-in-shanghai-as-covid-protests-flare-across-china-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/clashes-in-shanghai-as-covid-protests-flare-across-china-2</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clashes in Shanghai as COVID protests flare across China</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of demonstrators and police clashed in Shanghai on Sunday night as protests over China&rsquo;s stringent COVID restrictions flared for a third day and spread to several cities in the wake of a deadly apartment fire in the country&rsquo;s far west.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wave of civil disobedience is unprecedented in mainland China since President Xi Jinping assumed power a decade ago, as frustration mounts over his signature zero-COVID policy nearly three years into the pandemic. The COVID measures are also exacting a heavy toll on the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here because I love my country, but I don&rsquo;t love my government &hellip; I want to be able to go out freely, but I can&rsquo;t. Our COVID-19 policy is a game and is not based on science or reality,&rdquo; said a protester in the financial hub named Shaun Xiao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protesters also took to the streets in the cities of Wuhan and Chengdu on Sunday. In Beijing, small gatherings held peaceful vigils, while students on numerous university campuses around China gathered to demonstrate over the weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fire on Thursday at a residential high-rise building in the city of Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region, triggered protests after videos of the incident posted on social media led to accusations that lockdowns were a factor in the blaze that killed 10 people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urumqi officials abruptly held a news conference in the early hours of Saturday to deny COVID measures had hampered escape and rescue efforts. Many of Urumqi&rsquo;s 4 million residents have been under some of the country&rsquo;s longest lockdowns, barred from leaving their homes for as long as 100 days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday in Shanghai, police kept a heavy presence on Wulumuqi Road, which is named after Urumqi, and where a candlelight vigil the day before turned into protests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We just want our basic human rights. We can&rsquo;t leave our homes without getting a test. It was the accident in Xinjiang that pushed people too far,&rdquo; said a 26-year-old protester in Shanghai who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The people here aren&rsquo;t violent, but the police are arresting them for no reason. They tried to grab me but the people all around me grabbed my arms so hard and pulled me back so I could escape.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Sunday evening, hundreds of people gathered in the area. Some jostled with police trying to disperse them. People held up blank sheets of paper as an expression of protest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Reuters witness saw police escorting people onto a bus which was later driven away through the crowd with a few dozen people on board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday, the vigil in Shanghai for victims of the apartment fire turned into a protest against COVID curbs, with the crowd chanting calls for lockdowns to be lifted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From one tyrannical government to another:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/more-canadians-being-driven-to-euthanasia-to-escape-crippling-poverty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/more-canadians-being-driven-to-euthanasia-to-escape-crippling-poverty/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Canadians Being Driven to Euthanasia to Escape Crippling Poverty</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Farsoud was on the verge of being homeless and admitted his health condition would not allow him to survive on the streets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farsoud said that he did not want to die but could not afford to find another place to live, and instead opted for the country&rsquo;s assisted suicide laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City News Reporter Cynthia Mulligan said: &ldquo;Amir Farsoud has applied for medically assisted dying, known as (MAiD) he lives in constant agony due to a back injury but has started the process for end of life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Because his rooming house is up for sale and he can&rsquo;t find anywhere else to live that he can afford,&rdquo; Mulligan added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, a Canadian woman with a chronic health also chose to end her life under the country&rsquo;s assisted suicide laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, another woman, suffering from the same condition, reached the approval to end her life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Guardian reported at the time:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, a 51-year-old Ontario woman known as Sophia was granted physician-assisted death after her chronic condition became intolerable and her meager disability stipend left her little to survive on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The government sees me as expendable trash, a complainer, useless and a pain in the ass,&rdquo; she said in a video obtained by the network. For two years, she and friends had pleaded without success for better living conditions, she said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now a second case has emerged with several parallels: another woman, known as Denise, has also applied to end her life after being unable to find suitable housing and struggling to survive on disability payments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both were diagnosed with multiple chemical sensitivity (MCR), a condition in which common chemicals, such as those in cigarette smoke and laundry detergents, can trigger nausea, blinding headaches and in extreme cases, anaphylactic shock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Forbes reported earlier this month, Canada is often cited by those concerned about medically assisted dying as evidence of a &lsquo;slippery slope. Its MAID (Medical Assistance in Dying) law was introduced in 2016 for adults with conditions where death is reasonably foreseeable &ndash; expected within six months. It was extended to those with severe chronic but not terminal physical ailments in 2021 and will be further made available to those with severe chronic mental conditions in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently under consideration is the possibility of advance directives for people falling into conditions like dementia that will remove decision-making ability.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, this progression is proof of a &lsquo;slippery slope&rsquo; &ndash; once one element is allowed, others will inevitably follow until almost anything is permitted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For others, it is a careful and considered roll-out of a new set of laws &ndash; up to, but not beyond, a logical and morally defensible limit. In truth, Canada is not particularly exceptional in its approach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything currently permitted there is also available in a number of other countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada reversed 22 years of its jurisprudence by striking down the country&rsquo;s ban on assisted suicide as unconstitutional, blithely dismissing fears that the ruling would &lsquo;initiate a descent down a slippery slope into homicide&rsquo; against the vulnerable as founded on &lsquo;anecdotal examples.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next year, Parliament duly enacted legislation allowing euthanasia, but only for those who suffer from a terminal illness whose natural death was &lsquo;reasonably foreseeable,&rsquo; the spectator reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on that note&hellip; how about some good news?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2022/11/27/handgun-owners-carrying-daily-in-us-doubled-in-4-years-poll-finds-n2616399"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2022/11/27/handgun-owners-carrying-daily-in-us-doubled-in-4-years-poll-finds-n2616399</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handgun Owners Carrying Daily Doubled Thanks to Soft-on-Crime Woke Policies</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans feel less safe under President Joe Biden, and thanks to soft-on-crime woke cities, crime has surged during the last two years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Biden continues to threaten the Second Amendment, Americans are taking their safety into their hands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a new study by the University of Washington, the number of U.S. adult handgun owners carrying daily nearly doubled in four years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The November 16 study found that 6 million adults carried a firearm on themselves in 2019, which is up by 3 million in 2015.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-protection was cited as the main reason for the uptick in gun holders, with seven out of 10 saying that they carry a gun to protect themselves against other people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, only 9 million people reported carrying a handgun. Now, at least 16 million people say they carry a loaded weapon on them at least once a month.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total number of Americans owning handguns spiked from 38 million to 53 million in just a few short years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes as Biden called to ban assault rifles, claiming that it is &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; red flag laws are not being enforced throughout the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is going to attempt to pass a bill on the matter during Congress&rsquo; lame-duck session, right before Republicans take over the House, which they would most likely veto any sort of gun restricting laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans have heard time and time again from Democrats how more gun laws need to be enacted. Calling it &ldquo;sick&rdquo; that semi-automatic weapons are still allowed, Biden has zeroed in on trying to &ldquo;get rid of assault weapons.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now finally today, this one hits close to home here in Moscow Idaho, and we ask for your prayers for the police investigating this case, as well as for the families of those who lost loved ones:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-student-murders-update-police-why-key-details-withheld-from-public"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-student-murders-update-police-why-key-details-withheld-from-public</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho Student murders update: Police say why key details are being withheld from the public</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks have passed since authorities first began investigating the brutal murders of four University of Idaho students in Moscow, Idaho and no suspect or person of interest has been identified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police have also not yet provided key details surrounding the murders of Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, but they are doing so intentionally, according to Aaron Snell of the Idaho State Police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an interview on Fox News&rsquo; "Lawrence Jones Cross Country," Snell told host Lawrence Jones that investigators "don't currently have a suspect" but that keeping certain information "from view is going to be critical into trying to develop that."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Idaho police communications director answered: "It will potentially put more fear, more suspicion on a wide variety of people versus if we use that to really refine where we're at in our investigation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones also spoke with former NYPD Inspector Paul Mauro, who similarly confirmed that information from criminal profilers and evidence collected at the scene was being withheld.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mauro said Saturday evening that in addition to protecting the integrity of the investigation, the scarcity of key details that have been released to the public could lead investigators to swiftly find a suspect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A murder weapon has also not been found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four students were found dead at a house just yards from the U of I campus, hours after police say someone attacked them in their sleep.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snell said authorities also believe the attack "was a targeted incident" toward one or more of the three women who lived there. Chapin, the sole male victim did not live at the home and was visiting his girlfriend, Kernodle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for who was the target, that information is not publicly known.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snell also assured community members that investigators are utilizing the best technology available to get a picture of the series of events of Nov. 13.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another concern Snell addressed is the potential contamination of the crime scene, as two roommates are believed to have been in the home at the time of the murders. They are cooperative and have been ruled out as suspects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other people were invited into the home between when the bodies were initially found and when law enforcement arrived but Snell said the investigation was not compromised.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All individuals who were in the home when police arrived have been cleared.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor!</p>
<p>It's nearly December, and things are hectic around here. So, we're REPOSTING the very first podcast episodes we ever published!&nbsp; &nbsp;These were the days long before we joined the Fight Laugh Feast Network--when we sat around a tiny, hand-held recorder at JOHN'S house (not the Peaches' house), and we let the dog in and out while we chatted about culture, faith, and family.&nbsp;<br /><br />On this inaugural episode:</p>
<div>We explain the purpose of the podcast is to invite our neighbors into the chaos of our everyday life, for good conversation. There are some clicks, pops, and other technical issues with the recording because the producer is an amateurish hack who lacks even basic recording skills.&nbsp; He improves in future episodes...(kind of).</div>
<p>The Peaches and John discuss the usefulness of spirited debate in culture and religion.&nbsp; We also discuss whether or not Cami should have a snack.</p>
<p>This was first broadcasted in the fall of 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reach out to the Comedian Next Door, email <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>.&nbsp; Also, visit johnbranyan.com to get your tickets to Vacay with Comics 2023. It's going to be epic.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">What happened to fertility around the world? The numbers have dropped dramatically. Once we talked about the "Population Bomb.&rdquo; Now people talk about the "Birth Dearth.&rdquo; It seems counterintuitive that we have fewer kids the more we can afford them. Kevin DeYoung recently discussed the Case for Kids in an important essay published in First Things in the November 2022 issue. The Pugsters talk to Kevin about this important subject and why he thinks that it is a spiritual malaise that is at the root of it.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Wednesday, November 23, 2022. I&rsquo;m back ladies and gentleman! Gabe and I have made our return from Waterloo Canada, and the Church at War Conference; where we were able to fellowship with the likes of Pastor Tim Stephens, Jacob Raome, and Pastor James Coates, among a whole bevy of other rowdy Christians, who gave up their comforts, their careers, and sometimes, their families, for our King, Jesus Christ. Keep our brothers and sisters in Canada in your prayers as they make war against their wicked culture. Before I dive into the news:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this! White House shuts down reporter's Fauci question on COVID origin: 'I'm done with you'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/dl77nDxM47o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/dl77nDxM47o</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -Play 0:40-1:56</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa&hellip; order in the court ladies and gentleman!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre snapped at reporters who raised questions about the origins of COVID-19 during Tuesday's press briefing, which featured outgoing White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During questions after the White House coronavirus response team updated reporters on the administration's vaccine efforts, Daily Caller White House correspondent Diana Glebova attempted to ask a question regarding what Fauci has done to investigate the origins of COVID-19. But Jean-Pierre shut Glebova down and rebuked her for speaking out of turn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Today News Africa journalist Simon Ateba spoke up and said her question was valid and should be asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You need to call people across the room. She has a valid question, she's asked about the origin of COVID," Ateba said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fauci, who will step down as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in December, has faced questions from Republican lawmakers over his agency's support for coronavirus research in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIAID has provided millions of dollars in grant funding to EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit group that GOP critics claim has supported bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawmakers interested in the lab-leak origins theory of COVID-19 want to probe whether that research was the genesis of the pandemic and whether Fauci played any role in approving money that was sent to the Wuhan lab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/here-where-last-uncalled-house-races-stand-two-weeks-election-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/here-where-last-uncalled-house-races-stand-two-weeks-election-day</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is where the last uncalled House races stand two weeks from Election Day</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As results from midterms elections continue to trickle in two weeks past Election Day, four critical House races in Alaska, California and Colorado still remain uncalled.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Digital breaks down the outstanding races and what is taking so long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California, which has two of the four uncalled races, is a predominately vote-by-mail state, meaning every registered voter is automatically mailed a ballot 29 days prior to Election Day. With 22 million registered voters and weeks-long processing times, this means race calls can move very slowly in the Golden State.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California still has 593,925 remaining ballots to be counted, according to estimates from the California Secretary of State's report on Monday. Of the unprocessed ballots remaining, about 500,000 of these ballots were mailed in Election Officials. California permits election authorities one month to complete tallying which mean voters could be waiting as late as Dec. 8 for final race outcomes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In California's 3rd Congressional District, Republican Kevin Kiley holds a commanding lead over Democrat Kermit Jones; however, approximately only a little over half of ballots have been counted in the "likely Republican" race. California accepts mail-ballots for the week following Election Day, although the ballots must be postmarked by Nov. 8. The ballots must also go through a signature verification process before being counted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second uncalled race in California lies in the state's 13th Congressional District. This toss-up race is among the tightest remaining as Republican John Duarte narrowly leads Democrat Adam Gray by less than 800 votes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska's At-Large Congressional District still remains uncalled, held up by the vote counting process of the state's newly implemented ranked-choice voting system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seat has been rated by Fox News' Power Rankings as "lean Democratic" as a result of the ranked-choice system that gives incumbent Democrat Rep. Mary Peltola an advantage against her Republican opponents, former Gov. Sarah Palin and Nick Begich.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peltola led in the first round of the vote, with Palin in second and Begich in third, but failed to secure 50%, meaning those who voted for the candidate with the least number of votes will have their second choice vote reallocated to the other candidates until one reaches 50%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials will commence the counting of second- and third-place votes Nov. 23, meaning that Alaskans may know the final outcome of the House race by end of day, if all goes as expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado predominantly votes by mail, but processing is much swifter than California. In 2020, 90% of the vote was counted by Wednesday morning after Election Day, according to the Associated Press. Even so, mail-in ballots from out of state and overseas military service members can arrive as late as Wednesday as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite relatively speedier ballot processing times, Colorado's 3rd House district still remains too close to call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incumbent Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert was not expected to have such a close race with her Democratic opponent, Adam Frisch, in the "likely Republican" seat. The one-term congresswoman is narrowly leading the vote count by a little more than 500 votes, according to the Associated Press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the race qualifies for a recount under Colorado state law, Frisch conceded to Boebert on Friday. However, the Associated Press has still not called the race as of Tuesday.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ap-fires-reporter-responsible-for-fake-story-alleging-russian-missiles-hit-poland?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ap-fires-reporter-responsible-for-fake-story-alleging-russian-missiles-hit-poland?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AP fires reporter responsible for fake story alleging Russian missiles hit Poland</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press has reportedly fired journalist Jim LaPorta, who was one of two bylines that ran with the false report that Russian missiles hit Poland. The only source of that story was anonymous, which goes against AP's policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retracted story alleged that a senior US intelligence official said that Russian missiles "crossed into NATO member Poland, killing two people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story was taken down the next day and replaced with an editor's note stating that the story was false and that "subsequent reporting showed that the missiles were Russian-made and most likely fired by Ukraine in defense against a Russian attack."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AP's news values and principles state that there must be more than one anonymous source to run a story unless the "material comes from an authoritative figure who provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy," the AP said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaPorta wrote the article along with John Leicester, who is still working with AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/11/21/gen-z-whose-votes-bolstered-democrats-in-the-mid-terms-are-suffering-massive-pandemic-induced-depression/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/11/21/gen-z-whose-votes-bolstered-democrats-in-the-mid-terms-are-suffering-massive-pandemic-induced-depression/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gen Z &ndash; Whose Votes Bolstered Democrats in the Mid Terms &ndash; Are Suffering Massive Pandemic-Induced Depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of Gen Zers are struggling with mental health problems, according to a new survey, which reveals many of these problems were first identified during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is further evidence of the serious health consequences caused by the social-distancing measures taken in response to the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation Z is the third-largest population in America, after millennials and baby boomers. While Zoomers are often singled out for praise by the corporate media for racial and sexual diversity, it&rsquo;s also becoming clear many of them are suffering mental health issues to a far greater degree than earlier generations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey was carried out by Harmony Healthcare IT, an Indiana-based data-management company. Just over 1000 individuals aged 18 to 24, with a roughly equal gender balance, were asked a range of detailed questions about their mental health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-two percent of those surveyed said they were suffering from a diagnosed mental-health problem, with 25 percent saying their diagnosis took place during the pandemic.&nbsp; Anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and bulimia were just some of the conditions the respondents reported. By comparison with millennials or Gen X-ers, Zoomers are twice as likely to report struggling with emotional distress on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near 70 percent said that they felt the pandemic had a negative effect on their mental health. Zoomers appear to be deeply anxious, with 85 percent saying they were worried about the future. Nine out of ten Zoomers diagnosed with a mental-health issue have anxiety and eight out of ten suffer from depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particular concerns for Zoomers include personal finances, the economy, their health, the environment, politics, and the workplace. Three-quarters of Zoomers say they feel disadvantaged by comparison with older generations, and 90 percent have a hard time picturing a stable future for themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty percent of the study participants said they have a regular therapist, while 57 percent take regular medication and 39 percent attend therapy for mental health issues at least once a week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandemic Damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study is further evidence that the pandemic &ndash; in particular the social-distancing measures adopted by most governments around the world &ndash; had serious adverse consequences for the young that far outstrip any damage they might have suffered from contracting the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other studies have already substantiated the mental effects of isolation and exposure to fear and uncertainty about the virus&rsquo;s effects. A meta-analysis from the University of Calgary suggested that as many as one in four children worldwide are now suffering from depression and anxiety as a result of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These unintended effects have not just been psychological. A recent study showed children are exercising less and spending more time sitting down than ever before as a result of the pandemic. Researchers at the University of Bristol revealed that fewer than four out of 10 children were doing sufficient daily exercise at the end of 2021. Obesity rates have risen at a &ldquo;staggering&rdquo; pace, according to the American CDC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The restrictions are even believed to have affected babies in the womb. A study based on a review of 250 babies born in New York between March and December 2020 suggested that the pandemic had serious adverse developmental effects on newborns, even if the mother had not had COVID-19 during the pregnancy. The researchers believe that increased maternal stress during pregnancy may be to blame, as well as reduced interactions with other infants and more stressful interactions with parents and caregivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like the effects of the pandemic and the overzealous responses of government &ldquo;experts&rdquo; will continue to ramify through the increasingly unhappy lives of our younger generations, long after COVID-19 itself becomes a distant memory.</span></p>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Chatting with David Pendleton (Call Your Friends) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/e9163167-7499-484f-bf11-04778c34185b/tcnd-chatting-with-david-pendleton.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The intro is fake news.&nbsp; John isn't at the kitchen table--and The Peaches isn't co-hosting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />David Pendleton is a long time friend of the family and a gifted ventriloquist.&nbsp; (That's the type of skill that translates well in an audio-only podcast, doesn't it?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The men talk about various projects they're working on, but they DON'T want to be "intentional" with their conversation. (Ew.)&nbsp; &nbsp;David wants the conversation to be interesting for you, Neighbor.&nbsp; But--John isn't very worried about that...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cue the unscripted discussion now!</p>
<p>-Why do we only call our friends when we have something specific to talk about? (Or is that just a "Male Tendency"?)</p>
<p>-What are the differences between "real conversation" and social media speeches? (And what's up with texting?)</p>
<p>-The lack of human interaction is impacting how people actually THINK and process reality.</p>
<p>AND MORE!...including some discussion about prison sentences and the death penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find more information about David Pendleton's comedy by visiting anythingcantalk.com.&nbsp; Also, reach out to John Branyan by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>.&nbsp; Thanks for visiting with us, Neighbor!&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Apostle Paul says Christians are not to &ldquo;have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,&rdquo; but are to &ldquo;expose them.&rdquo; Yet, when it comes to legislation being filed around the country opposing &ldquo;gender affirming care&rdquo; for minors, many Christians are being tempted to join those whose worldview is darkness and, therefore, ultimately unfruitful. David exposes the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; worldview to which many are falling prey by using observations by J. Gresham Machen taken from <em>Christianity and Liberalism</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Abbott to deploy National Guard, gun boats to secure Texas border against invasion of illegal aliens</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Texas governor Greg Abbott announced that he had invoked the Invasion Clauses of both the state and federal Constitutions in an attempt to put an end to Biden's border crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement posted to Twitter, Abbott explained that by treating the flow of illegal migration as an "invasion," Texas would be able to tackle the problem with unprecedented vigor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I invoked the Invasion Clauses of the US &amp; Texas Constitutions to fully authorize Texas to take unprecedented measures to defend our state against an invasion," Abbott stated, adding that he's "using that constitutional authority, &amp; other authorization &amp; Executive Orders to keep our state &amp; country safe."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott revealed that his government will deploy both the National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety to "repel," turn back and arrest those trying to enter the country illegally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, he expressed intentions of constructing a border wall in multiple counties, deploying gun boats, and designating Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott noted that Texas does not intend to act alone in this endeavor, and will enter into agreements with other states and foreign nations to secure the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 2 million migrant encounters were recorded in Fiscal Year 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-wins-gop-nomination-for-house-speaker"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-wins-gop-nomination-for-house-speaker</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy wins GOP nomination for House speaker</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy won the Republicans' designation for House speaker on Tuesday, but questions remain over his ability to lock up the spot on the floor in January.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy, R-Calif., beat back a challenge by more conservative elements in the House Republican Conference represented by Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The final vote tally was 188-31.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Biggs&rsquo; support came from members of the hard line House Freedom Caucus. Biggs had previously chaired the group, which counts more than two dozen House Republicans among its membership, between 2019 and 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy, meanwhile, was able to assemble a large cross-section of the House GOP conference behind his candidacy. That included conservative hardliners like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and centrists like Rep. Brian FitzPatrick of Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the number of people who opposed him could cause trouble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Losing 31 means he is in serious danger of not having the votes in January which would mean he&rsquo;d need to drop out either that day or he could decide to before," said a senior aide to GOP leadership. "At that point, others would pounce."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To become speaker in January, McCarthy will need at least 218 votes if the entire 435-member House is seated and voting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the potential Republican majority looks to be anywhere between 218 seats, the bare minimum needed to control the House, and 228 seats. The latter would constitute a sweep of all outstanding races, including some in which Democrats are favored, but still falls far short of the 60 seats McCarthy predicted could be possible under a GOP wave that never materialized.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2022/11/15/key-inflation-metrics-surges-again-n2615978"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2022/11/15/key-inflation-metrics-surges-again-n2615978</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Inflation Metric Makes Biggest Jump Since June</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The October read on producer inflation showed some of the highest numbers in months on key indicators of price increases that have come as a result of the Biden administration and congressional Democrats' tax-and-spend agenda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Month-over-month, headline PPI inflation advanced 0.2 percent in October &mdash; the same as in September &mdash; and prices upstream from consumers increased a full eight percent in the 12 months ending in October.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core PPI number that excludes more volatile foods, energy, and trade services also saw prices increase 0.2 percent for an annual advance of 5.4 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the more alarming data points in the latest Producer Price Index report include the index for final demand goods, which advanced 0.6 percent in October &mdash; the largest advance since June when that metric increased 2.2 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration's war on safe, cheap, and reliable energy has also taken a toll on inflation, as seen again in October's PPI report in which most of the month-over-month increases "can be traced to a 2.7-percent jump in prices for final demand energy," the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted in its latest report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What's more, 60 percent of October's price increases for final demand goods are attributable to the index for gasoline which jumped 5.7 percent. At the same time, prices also increased for diesel fuel, fresh and dry vegetables, residential electric power, chicken eggs, and oil and gas field machinery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only potential bright spot in October's PPI report is the 0.1 percent decrease seen in final demand services, its first downward movement since November of 2020. However, final demand services excluding trade, transportation, and warehousing increased by 0.2 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/bus-carrying-illegal-aliens-to-arrive-in-philadelphia-this-week?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/bus-carrying-illegal-aliens-to-arrive-in-philadelphia-this-week?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bus carrying illegal aliens to arrive in Philadelphia this week</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia is preparing for the potential arrival of a busload of migrants coming from Del Rio, Texas, later this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the city told Fox News that information regarding the bus and its arrival are still not clear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney told NBC Philadelphia that the city would welcome the migrants "with open arms," though he also remained unclear of the timeline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city is confident that they have enough of a plan in place, including shelter, food, and clothing. There are also plans to try and expedite work permits for the migrants so that they may become self-sufficient sooner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other self-proclaimed sanctuary cities that have received migrant buses in the last few months have reported being overwhelmed by the influx of illegal immigrants, so much so that a public emergency was declared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Governor Greg Abbott first announced that he would be transporting busloads of migrants out of Texas back in April. He has since then sent out hundreds of migrant buses to sanctuary cities across the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 300th bus filled with migrants from Texas left for Chicago last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The migrant buses have been dismissed by Democrats as simply a publicity stunt, but Abbott insists that the move is to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed border towns that take the brunt of Biden's failing immigration policies.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Soccer Embraces Acts Of Grave Depravity By Making The Traditional Crest Rainbow Colored &ldquo;To Support And Embrace The LGBTQ Community&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by The Daily Mail, USMNT&rsquo;s Chief Communications Officer Neil Buethe explained the decision to include the rainbow crest, &ldquo;As part of our approach for any match or event, we include rainbow branding to support and embrace the LGBTQ community, as well as to promote a spirit of inclusiveness and welcoming to all fans across the globe.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added, &ldquo;As a result, locations that we will manage and operate at the FIFA World Cup, such as the team hotel, media areas and parties, will feature both traditional and rainbow U.S. Soccer branding.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buether provided another statement to Reuters explaining the rainbow crest, &ldquo;Our rainbow badge has an important and consistent role in the identity of U.S. Soccer. As part of our approach for any match or event, we include rainbow branding to support and embrace the LGBTQ community, as well as to promote a spirit of inclusiveness and welcoming to all fans across the globe.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then reiterated, &ldquo;As a result, locations that we will manage and operate at the FIFA World Cup, such as the team hotel, media areas and parties, will feature both traditional and rainbow U.S. Soccer branding.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter also addressed the rainbow flag being displayed at the team&rsquo;s training facility in Qatar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/TNchAw4Bjsc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/TNchAw4Bjsc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -Play 6:38-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be The Change was started in the wake of George Floyd&rsquo;s death. The U.S. Soccer website explains, &ldquo;Back in late 2020, following the death of George Floyd and the continued importance of the Black Lives Matter movement, the U.S. Men&rsquo;s National Team players came together and had conversations about the social injustices that exist at home and across the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message doesn&rsquo;t just include promotion of the violent Black Lives Matter movement that destroyed numerous cities and lives that have still not recovered to this day, the promotion of the immoral LGBTQ lifestyle that Catechisms declare as &ldquo;acts of grave depravity&rdquo; and &ldquo;intrinsically disordered,&rdquo; but it also spawned into an anti-self defense campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, if the US really wanted to make a stand as opposed to just virtue signaling, how about you just not play? What about instead of virtue signaling, we saw some virtue doing? Just a thought. Even though homosexuality isn&rsquo;t virtuous&hellip;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Liberty Dispatch</strong> ~ November 15, 2022</p>
<p class="p1">On this episode of Liberty Dispatch, hosts Andrew and Matty examine the week that was in their Week-in-Review, they recap the <em>Emergencies Act </em>Inquiry, and the Liberal's plan to increase Canadian immigration at the very time the country's institutions are failing.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>This week the Rebels continue the new mini series started last week about Paradigm Shifts in faith and doctrine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A paradigm shift is a fundamental change in thinking or assumptions. Certain doctrines, when discovered in scripture or embraced in the life of a believer have the potential to change EVERYTHING!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second installment of this fun series P Nate, #1 and Air Jordan are back in Garage-Mahal to discuss why Complementarianism is not enough... and how they&rsquo;ve transitioned from a pretty complementarian lite- to a rich and robust Patricarchical view of the World.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Tuesday, November 15th, 2022. Just a heads up ladies and gentleman, I will be out of the country and into Canada with Gabe the Waterboy the 16th-21st, so we will only have a newsbrief today, and Wednesday morning, but not to worry, I&rsquo;ll be back next week to bring you the news&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Redballoon</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so long ago, the American dream was alive and well. Employees who worked hard were rewarded, and employers looked for people who could do the job, not for people who had the right political views.&nbsp; RedBalloon.work is a job site designed to get us back to what made American businesses successful: free speech, hard work, and having fun.&nbsp; If you are a free speech employer who wants to hire employees who focus on their work and not identity politics, then post a job on RedBalloon.&nbsp; If you are an employee who is being censored at work or is being forced to comply with the current zeitgeist, post your resume on RedBalloon and look for a new job. redballoon.work, the job site where free speech is still alive!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/maricopa-election-officials-launched-pac-in-2021-to-stop-maga-candidates?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/maricopa-election-officials-launched-pac-in-2021-to-stop-maga-candidates?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maricopa election officials launched PAC in 2021 to stop MAGA candidates</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been revealed that embattled Arizona's Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer and Supervisor Chairman Bill Gates in 2021 started a political action committee to stop MAGA candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 17, 2021, Meg Cunningham from the Kansas City Beacon tweeted that Richer, "the Maricopa County recorder, is launching a PAC to support Rs running for non-federal AZ offices who 'acknowledge the validity of the 2020 election and condemn the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as a terrible result of the lies told about the November election.'"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richer retweeted her saying, "Thanks to a few generous donors this is now launching. Join me if you care about traditional Republican 'stuff' (free people, free markets, rule of law), but also don&rsquo;t believe in conspiracies about the 2020 election or that Jan 6 was a tourist event."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PAC called Pro Democracy Republicans of Arizona claims on their website that they are "fighting to keep our democratic institutions alive."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website is sparse on details aside from how to donate but does have a few sentences on their mission. "The Arizona election wasn&rsquo;t stolen. We Republicans simply had a presidential candidate who lost, while we had many other candidates who won. It&rsquo;s time we Republicans accept and acknowledge that fact."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Candidates come and go. But our democratic institutions are long-lasting, and peaceful transitions of power are a hallmark of the United States.&nbsp; We should not abandon this history in favor of conspiracy theorists and demagoguery."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"To that end, we are launching this PAC to support pro-democracy Arizona Republicans."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political pundits, candidates, and others have continued to slam Arizona&rsquo;s Maricopa County Elections Department for ongoing failures in their election system. Almost a week after election day, the county, as well as the state, are some of the last to not have candidates declared as winners, as votes continue to be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Secretary of State, gubernatorial Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs was in charge of overseeing the election after failing to recuse herself.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1590526914019864577"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1590526914019864577</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:00-2:12</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday night, Republican gubernatorial nominee and Trump-endorsed candidate Kari Lake called out her opponent and Maricopa County Richer as "incompetent."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of Arizona's gubernatorial race between Hobbs and Lake are still pending as is the senatorial race between Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican challenger Blake Masters.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/another-court-rules-against-biden-administrations-student-loan-forgiveness-program_4862341.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/another-court-rules-against-biden-administrations-student-loan-forgiveness-program_4862341.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appeals Court Rules Against Biden Administration&rsquo;s Student Loan Forgiveness Program</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal appeals court on Nov. 14 entered a ruling against the student loan forgiveness program announced by President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erasing student loan debt would be &ldquo;irreversible,&rdquo; a panel of the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ruled, entering an injunction against the administration pending an appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel consisted of U.S. Circuit Judges Bobby Shepherd, a George W. Bush appointee; Ralph Erickson, a Donald Trump appointee; and Steven Grasz, another Trump appointee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They sided with Missouri and five other Republican-led states that had sued Biden and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona after the announcement of the program, alleging that it was illegal for the executive branch to enact such widespread loan relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden administration officials have said that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 grants the authority for the relief, which is expected to cost about $400 billion and apply to tens of millions of Americans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court ruling came after U.S. District Judge Henry Edward Autrey, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected the states&rsquo; suit, finding that they lacked standing to sue on behalf of the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three appeals judges disagreed, finding that MOHELA is effectively an arm of the state of Missouri and even if it wasn&rsquo;t, the financial effect of the administration&rsquo;s debt discharge still threatens Missouri because it would affect the state&rsquo;s Lewis and Clark Discovery Fund, a capital fund that can support projects at colleges. The fund receives money from MOHELA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling follows a separate appeals court decision to temporarily block the program and U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman, a Trump appointee, finding it unconstitutional and vacating it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Pittman&rsquo;s ruling, dated Nov. 8&mdash;the same day as the midterm elections&mdash;the administration stopped accepting applications for the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administration lawyers have already appealed that ruling and the government will hold onto information from the 26 million borrowers, including the 16 million who have already been approved for relief, &ldquo;so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court,&rdquo; White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2022/11/14/oregon-leftists-bragging-about-new-gun-control-law-n510693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2022/11/14/oregon-leftists-bragging-about-new-gun-control-law-n510693</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon leftists bragging about new gun control law</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red wave in Oregon didn&rsquo;t happen for the most part, though Republicans took a House seat here and there and performed well in the more rural, western part of the state as usual. The hype surrounding the possibility that Democrat Tina Kotek could be defeated, turning the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion red, fizzled in the end. Another piece of bad news turned up in a ballot measure that didn&rsquo;t draw all that much attention on the national level. Measure 114 passed on election day, ushering in a new round of gun control restrictions and requirements. NBC News launched into a celebration of this &ldquo;victory&rdquo; in which they bemoaned the rising number of deaths involving firearms in recent years while claiming (without evidence) that this new law in Oregon would do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this climate, voters in Oregon have fought back. Heading into the midterm elections, voters took it upon themselves to strengthen gun laws by proposing Measure 114, a ballot initiative that requires a background check, a license and safety training to buy firearms in the state. The measure also prohibits large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon&rsquo;s measure is particularly important because Congress, the courts and many state legislatures have done so little to contain the violence. Meanwhile, the number of gun deaths in the United States has skyrocketed &mdash; in fact, our analysis of the data shows that guns drove a recent spike in homicides and suicides&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the Supreme Court&rsquo;s expansion of Americans&rsquo; right to own guns, it can be frustrating to consider what preventive steps are possible. The Oregon referendum, however, is an example of how laws can prevent gun violence. Firearm purchaser licensing, as contained in the ballot measure, is one of the most effective policies at reducing gun deaths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, there&rsquo;s nothing really unique or groundbreaking about this measure when compared to similar proposals in other liberal states. They are requiring all purchasers of firearms to complete a background check (which everyone already had to do anyway) and complete mandatory gun safety training before being able to obtain a license to own a gun. It also limits the size of magazines to ten rounds of ammunition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Measure 114 really does is make it more time-consuming, expensive, and laborious for lawful residents to legally obtain a firearm. NBC goes to great lengths to document how many gun-related deaths have been recorded in the country of late, concluding that Oregon&rsquo;s law will impact those statistics in a positive way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, what&rsquo;s entirely missing in this liberal &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; is any sort of context or even a nod to the reality of gun crime in the United States. Yes, more people are getting shot. That&rsquo;s only one facet of the rising violent crime rates we&rsquo;ve been seeing, primarily in urban areas. And the NBC report conveniently ignores the fact that the vast, vast majority of the people being shot are the victims of criminals who could never pass a background check and get their guns on the black or gray markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also ignored in this report is the reality that lower-income minority citizens are disproportionately the victims of these gun crimes. And by making it harder for the law-abiding to obtain a firearm, you&rsquo;re making it hard for them to defend themselves if such a thing happens to them.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/report-ftx-ceo-detained-by-authorities-in-bahamas?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/report-ftx-ceo-detained-by-authorities-in-bahamas?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX CEO detained by authorities in Bahamas</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the collapsing cryptocurrency company FTX, along with two others associated with the company, director of engineering Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang, are "under supervision" in the Bahamas after the trio reportedly were planning on fleeing to Dubai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Cointelegraph, "Right now three of them, Sam, Gary, and Nishad are under supervision in the Bahamas, which means it will be hard for them to leave."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubai is a city in the United Arab Emirates that prior to February 24, 2022, had no extradition treaty with the United States. However, as of that date, the two countries signed a mutual legal assistance treaty which does permit extradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency company FTX, run by CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the second biggest Democrat donor right after George Soros, collapsed last week as details emerged regarding their financial practices, which led to a run by customers on FTX.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX did not have the funds to pay out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"FTX is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the management and handling of client funds. With this latest development, FTX has more questions to answer as scrutiny builds around the SEC investigation," Cryptoslate reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly $5 billion was withdrawn from FTX on Sunday. The trouble began for FTX last week when rival crypto company Binance said they were selling off their holdings of FTT, the proprietary coin of FTX. After Binance's comments, FTX was in financial trouble and essentially sought a bailout from other firms, Binance among them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Post reports that FTX's implosion followed revelations "that co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried had been funneling money to a sister trading company run by his girlfriend." That company, Alameda Research, is run by Bankman-Fried's girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, and is also based in the Bahamas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance announced that they would buy the company, then pulled out of the deal, saying that after some due diligence, they decided it would not be a good investment. Part of the issue for Binance is that Alameda Research, helmed by Bankman-Fried's girlfriend, holds a great deal of their assets in FTT, and FTX had invested their customers' funds into Alameda through a "back door," without oversight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">etails have emerged that FTX had partnered with Ukraine to process donations to their war efforts within days of Joe Biden pledging billions of American taxpayer dollars to the country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one hits close to home for our producer Neil, as this was his first ever favorite fighter when it came to MMA&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2022/11/13/23456635/two-time-ufc-title-challenger-anthony-rumble-johnson-dead-at-38"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.mmafighting.com/2022/11/13/23456635/two-time-ufc-title-challenger-anthony-rumble-johnson-dead-at-38</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-time UFC title challenger Anthony &lsquo;Rumble&rsquo; Johnson dead at 38</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony Johnson, a Bellator fighter and two-time UFC title challenger, has died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was 38 years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MMA Fighting has confirmed the news with sources with knowledge of the situation, following an outpouring of messages on social media regarding Johnson&rsquo;s death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause of death has yet to be announced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson is best remembered for a pair of UFC stints from 2007-2012 and 2014-2017. His first run with the promotion saw him emerge as an intriguing welterweight prospect with unmatched knockout power, while his second run occurred as a light heavyweight. It was during Johnson&rsquo;s second UFC run that he defeated the likes of Glover Teixeira, Ryan Bader, Alexander Gustafsson, and Phil Davis, and earned two cracks at the light heavyweight championship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He announced his retirement after a 2017 title fight loss to Daniel Cormier, but returned to competition in 2021 and fought once for Bellator, defeating Jose Augusto by second-round knockout. In October 2021, Johnson was to fight Bellator light heavyweight champion Vadim Nemkov as part of a grand prix tournament, but was forced to withdraw from that contest due to an undisclosed illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson&rsquo;s pro MMA record was 23-6 with 17 wins coming by way of KO/TKO.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're at the end of a long, tiring day. But we're still going to record a podcast, because we're just that generous, Neighbor! Get ready for some hard-hitting social commentary.</p>
<p>John is concerned his vote may not be counted because of his writing utensil, and the Peaches briefly considered running for school board on the platform: "My Kids Will Never Attend Here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEXT: There's an article published by Desiring God which actually acknowledges the sinfulness of women, and we almost can't believe it!&nbsp; (Title: "She Needs Truth: How Hard Words Serve Women")</p>
<p>LATER: Imagine being inspired and uplifted by a politician's speech... Imagine needing to hear that a Democratic candidate "sees you."&nbsp; Yikes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINALLY: Social media has really messed up a lot of people.&nbsp; The Peaches used to see the Internet as a Mission Field, but maybe we've been sending people out there to evangelize before they were ready. Christians are not doing a great job standing up to the evil, on the whole.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Senate runoff: Walker hauls in $3.3 million on first day of new campaign</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker hauled in $3.3 million in fundraising on the first day of his Senate runoff campaign with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, Walker&rsquo;s advisers shared first with Fox News on Thursday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on Thursday, the campaign raised an additional $1 million before noon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walker, who finished roughly 35,000 votes behind Warnock out of nearly 4 million votes cast in the Senate election in the battleground state of Georgia, is returning to the campaign trail Thursday, teaming up with conservative Sen. Ted Cruz at a rally in Canton, a small city about 40 miles north of Atlanta. Walker&rsquo;s campaign tells Fox News that it plans to be back up on television with an ad later this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Georgia secretary of state's office announced Wednesday that the Senate election was headed to a runoff since no candidate received over 50% of the vote. According to the latest unofficial and incomplete returns, Warnock was at 49.4%, Walker at 48.5% and Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver at 2.1%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Georgia law, if no candidate tops 50% of the vote in the general election, the two top vote-getters face off in a runoff, which this cycle is being held four weeks later on Dec. 6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warnock, who is the minister at Atlanta&rsquo;s famed Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, narrowly edged Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Georgia&rsquo;s twin Jan. 5, 2021, Senate runoff elections. His victory, along with now-Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff&rsquo;s razor-thin win over GOP Sen. David Perdue, gave the Democrats the Senate majority.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Walker campaign source told Fox News that they plan to hold rallies in large-population areas where turnout happens, with the aim to energize supporters of former President Donald Trump, "soft Republicans" and independents to vote in the runoff contest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The source said that it would make sense for Trump and for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also extremely popular with conservatives nationwide, to stump with Walker in Georgia in the weeks ahead and added that the campaign is looking into the possibility of making that happen. The source added that GOP Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp may join Walker on the campaign trail as early as next week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kemp, who comfortably won re-election on Tuesday with an eight-point victory over Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams in a rematch of their 2018 nail-biter, said Wednesday on "Fox and Friends," "I feel very good about getting Herschel across the finish line."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rival Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) announced Thursday a new $7 million field organizing investment in the Georgia runoff, which the Senate Democrats&rsquo; campaign arm says will fund direct voter contact programs, beefing up Warnock&rsquo;s already "robust" field organizing efforts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warnock, in a fundraising email to supporters, noted that "Donald Trump, [longtime Senate GOP leader] Mitch McConnell, and the entire Republican establishment have spent millions to prop up my opponent, Herschel Walker, and defeat me. And they're about to spend a whole lot more to definitively turn Georgia red."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona election results delayed until after weekend, Maricopa officials say</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election results in Arizona will likely be delayed past the weekend as a Maricopa County spokesperson said the counting of ballots will not be done Friday as original expected. The nation anxiously awaits the results of the gubernatorial election and senate races.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kari Lake faced off against Democrat Katie Hobbs, who refused to step onto the debate stage and address her opponent, while Blake Masters seeks to unseat incumbent Mark Kelly for an Arizona senate seat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ali Bradley reports, "AZ: Spokesperson for #MaricopaCounty elections tells me the majority of ballots won&rsquo;t be done being counted until after the weekend. They initially anticipated 95-99% of ballots to be completed by Friday. An historic 290k ballots were dropped off #ElectionDay causing the delay."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the early morning hours of Election Day, voters experienced issues with Maricopa County's tabulator machines, with one polling worker revealing that around 25 percent of ballots were being rejected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then the counting of votes has been trickling in, especially after 290,000 ballots were dropped off Election day. There has been much speculation as to why there are so many delays, and accusations levied at election officials, who are blamed for delaying and stalling the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday evening, Maricopa County officials revealed that 70 out of 223 voting locations, or nearly one out of every three, were impacted by printer issues on Election Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to AZ Mirror, Republicans voting by mail was down during the lead-up to the election, with Democrats leading early turnouts. Republican voters had been expected to turn up in force on Election Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with Charlie Kirk on Tuesday, Turning Point Action Chief Operating Officer Tyler Bowyer revealed that his ballot, and many others, had been printed so badly that machines couldn&rsquo;t read the.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA drops charges against Konnech CEO over storing data on Chinese servers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Los Angeles County prosecutor George Gascon dropped criminal charges against Eugene Yu, CEO of the Michigan election software company Konnech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu was arrested in October, and stands accused of storing data on poll workers in a China-based server, which was a breach of the company&rsquo;s contract with LA County.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the district attorney&rsquo;s office said that it had dropped the case due to concerns regarding the "pace of the investigation" and the "potential bias in the presentation" of evidence in the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mr. Yu is an innocent man," said Gary Lincenberg, Yu&rsquo;s lawyer, adding that "conspiracy theorists" were using the arrest to "further their political agenda."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Times, the sudden dismissal of the case leaves questions unanswered about Yu&rsquo;s activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The district attorney&rsquo;s office did not clarify whether the company had, in fact, stored data in China. It was also not clear whether additional criminal or civil charges could be filed against Mr. Yu or Konnech from Los Angeles County or dozens of other counties that use Konnech&rsquo;s election management software," the New York Times reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu and Konnech had been at the center of a lawsuit against True the Vote, alongside leaders Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization said at a conference over the summer that its team had located and downloaded Konnech&rsquo;s poll worker data from the Chinese servers, and said that it had delivered the data to the FBI.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Konnech accused True the Vote of hacking and defamation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dropping of charges comes just days after Engelbrecht and Phillips were released from jail after refusing to release the name of a confidential informant to judges in the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Reuters, the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office had indicated that it had not ruled out refiling charges after a review of evidence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office said that it had created a new team of investigators to review the "immense volume of digital data" it has collected in the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gascon has faced a recall effort since taking office, with those against Gascon accusing him of being soft on crime. In July, the recall effort had received enough votes to proceed, though in August, it was revealed that they did not in fact have enough signatures, with nearly 90,000 signatures of the 566,857 signatures being from not registered voters and roughly 45,000 were duplicates, according to Los Angeles Magazine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hearing has been moved up regarding the recall effort and their signatures to December 6, with the group being granted an expedited review of the signatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After assuming office in December of 2020, Gascon immediately began sweeping reforms to the criminal justice system in the city. Such reforms include ending sentence enhancements, doing away with cash bail, prohibiting anyone under the age of 18 from being tried as an adult, and refusing to work with immigration enforcement officials.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/SHOCKER-biological-males-dominate-non-binary-division-in-new-york-city-marathon?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/SHOCKER-biological-males-dominate-non-binary-division-in-new-york-city-marathon?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SHOCKER: Biological males dominate 'non-binary' division in New York City Marathon</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the second year running, biological males have dominated the non-binary category of the New York City Marathon, and this year, their physical sporting advantage was awarded a cash prize, meaning equal prize money for men and women competing in the event is now a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NYC Marathon made the decision to include a non-binary category for the first time in 2021 but didn&rsquo;t offer any prize money for the winners. This year, however, the non-profit organization New York Road Runners paid out $9,000 to Jacob Caswell who finished in first place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Mara Yamauchi, a two-time Olympic marathoner, and Robert Johnson, co-founder of LetsRun.com, published an article arguing that gender identity has no place in sport, and that the decision to pay out prize money to the winner of the non-binary category was a mistake and amounts to discrimination against female athletes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A non-binary category &hellip;introduces something which is irrelevant in sport - belief - as a sports category,&rdquo; they explain in the article. &ldquo;Other beliefs, such as religion or political affiliation, are as irrelevant as the belief that one is non-binary.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A non-binary category discriminates against females because males run, on average, about ten percent faster than females&hellip;So females in the non-binary category are not competing on a level playing field,&rdquo; the article continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two athletes went on to question what the prize money was rewarding, stating that it clearly wasn&rsquo;t athletic excellence given that the winner of the non-binary category would have finished in 147th place if competing in the men&rsquo;s category. The NYRR had intended to pay out $15,000 in prize money but only two non-binary runners managed to finish within the 3:10 cutoff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article was shared on LetsRun.com and received a significant amount of feedback, with many agreeing that gender identity has no place in sports, while others felt being inclusive was more important than fairness. Johnson posted a statement in the website&rsquo;s chat forum defending the points made in the article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to numerous people asking why he cared, Johnson responded that the truth matters and there &ldquo;needs to be a respect for objective scientific facts for society to function.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Bible tells ONE story through its 66 books. Scripture is analogous to itself, that is, the Bible is entirely consistent within itself. There are no contradictions. So the best interpreter of the Scripture is the Scripture itself. The New Testament is the best commentary on the Old Testament, and the Old helps us to better understand the New. Interpreting the Bible takes work, but we must read Scripture in light of other Scripture.</p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There Will Be Senate Runoff Next Month in Georgia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Georgia election official said early Wednesday that it is likely there will be a Senate runoff election slated for December between incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and GOP challenger and former NFL star Herschel Walker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warnock appeared to hold a slim lead over Walker with around 98 percent of the vote counted. Warnock, however, did not reach the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff in the state. No election forecasters, including The Associated Press, have called the race.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver garnered about 2.1 percent of the vote. If the Georgia Senate race heads to a runoff, only Walker and Warnock would remain on the ballot&mdash;and Oliver would be removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walker, meanwhile, appeared to be more optimistic. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come to lose,&rdquo; Walker said, according to AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A runoff campaign would be a four-week blitz that, depending on the outcomes in other Senate contests, could reprise the 2020 election cycle, when two Senate runoffs in Georgia doubled as a national winner-take-all battle for Senate control. Victories from Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) left the chamber divided 50&ndash;50 between the two major parties, with Vice President Kamala Harris giving Democrats the tie-breaking vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Runoff dynamics this year would vary widely depending on the Senate makeup. If the Senate majority already has been settled, it could make it easier for Warnock to frame the race as a localized choice between himself and Walker. But if the Georgia outcome determines which party will hold a majority and set the agenda, Walker could have the upper-hand in his effort to tie Warnock to President Joe Biden and national Democrats.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-candidate-unseats-house-veteran-historic-upset-dems-took-granted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-candidate-unseats-house-veteran-historic-upset-dems-took-granted</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP candidate unseats Democratic leader in historic upset: Dems 'took it for granted'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Sean Patrick Maloney was defeated by GOP nominee and State Assemblyman Mike Lawler in a historic House loss in Tuesday's midterm election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawler, who ran heavily on crime and the economy, will unseat the longtime congressman who was first elected in 2013, The Associated Press projects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I think he took it for granted." Lawler said in an interview with Fox News Digital on Wednesday. "As recently as a month ago he was traveling to Paris, London and Geneva to raise money for the DCCC. He did not start campaigning seriously in the district until a couple of weeks ago."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maloney has come under fire in recent days for suggesting that families struggling with the impacts of inflation eat Chef Boyardee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These comments come on the heels of Maloney's frequent trips to high-end European cities over the summer to raise money for House Democrats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawler made crime a key focus of his campaign, running in a district where over half of the households have a cop, veteran or first-responder living in them, according to Lawler.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this big-ticket win, the upset was one of only a handful House pickups for Republicans on a night where many political analysts and polls predicted a "red wave." The balance of power in the House is still in play with many races still uncalled.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ballot-initiatives-protecting-access-abortion-win-across-five-states-midterms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ballot-initiatives-protecting-access-abortion-win-across-five-states-midterms</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballot initiatives protecting access to abortion win across five states in midterms</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters across the country backed a series of ballot initiatives on Tuesday protecting access to abortion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results were largely uniform from California to Montana to Michigan. Voters backed proposals to enshrine abortion rights into law, while simultaneously striking down efforts by conservatives to restrict the practice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, voters passed a ballot initiative creating a right to abortion within the state's constitution. The initiative, which passed by roughly double digits, according to the Michigan Board of Elections, also strikes down a 1931 law that bans abortion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters backed similar ballot measures in Vermont and California enshrining abortion rights into their respective state constitutions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Republican-led Kentucky and Montana, meanwhile, voters struck down ballot initiatives seeking to restrict access to abortion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky's citizens opted against amending the state constitution to clarify there is no right to abortion or a requirement for the government to fund the practice. The initiative failed by a 52-47% margin with nearly 90% of votes counted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montana's voters, on the other hand, are poised to reject a ballot measure codifying into state law federal protections for infants born after a botched abortion. The initiative would have defined an infant "alive" at any gestational age as a legal person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have also instituted criminal penalties for health care providers that did not provide life-saving care to infants born during an attempted abortion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While votes are still outstanding and the ballot initiative has not been officially rejected, opponents have a healthy lead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/11/08/2022-election-cycle-sets-midterm-spending-record-16-7-billion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/11/08/2022-election-cycle-sets-midterm-spending-record-16-7-billion/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 Election Cycle Sets Midterm Spending Record of $16.7 Billion</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 election cycle set a midterm spending record of $16.7 billion, according to OpenSecrets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total represents money spent on both federal and state races.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No other midterm election has seen as much money at the state and federal levels as the 2022 elections,&rdquo; Sheila Krumholz, OpenSecrets&rsquo; executive director, told CNBC. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing record-breaking totals spent on elections up and down the ballot.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats raised over $1.1 billion from grassroots donors in 2022, double the amount of Republicans&rsquo; grassroots efforts, according to the WinRed and ActBlue fundraising platforms, the Financial Times reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican PACs and committees out-raised Democrat committees and PACs by about 50 percent for a total of $1.1 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican donors who greatly contributed to the effort were historically active GOP backers. Half of the GOP committee and PAC money came from about 10 donors, &ldquo;including $77mn from Richard Uihlein, $67mn from Ken Griffin, $44mn from Jeff Yass and $40mn from Timothy Mellon. Steve Schwarzman, Peter Thiel and Larry Ellison have each given $31mn-$34mn to these groups,&rdquo; the Times reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the money was spent on Senate races.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/08/zelenskyy-negotiations-russia-economy-midterms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/08/zelenskyy-negotiations-russia-economy-midterms/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&rsquo;s Zelenskyy Says He&rsquo;s Open To Negotiations With Russia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signaled a willingness to consider negotiations with Russia after it was reported Washington has urged Ukraine to ease up on its hard line against negotiations with Russia on Monday, according to The Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking ahead of his video address to the global climate summit held in Egypt, Zelenskyy laid out several conditions for returning to the negotiating table with Moscow, including respecting Ukraine&rsquo;s pre-war borders, offering reparations for the damage done to Kyiv and prosecuting those who have committed war crimes, according to the WSJ. The U.S. urged Kyiv to maintain a public appearance of openness to negotiating with Russia, even while acknowledging Russian leaders will not agree to withdrawal from occupied areas of Ukraine, The Washington Post reported Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. leaders have reiterated that Ukraine has the final word on negotiating terms, according to the WSJ. Kyiv previously insisted no further talks could happen unless new leadership took over at the Kremlin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouragement to keep an open posture toward negotiating with Russia is intended to secure the lasting support of allies, officials familiar with the matter told the Post. Many governments, including the United States, face growing opposition from constituencies concerned that funding the Ukrainian resistance could deepen economic hardships as inflation refuses to let up and food shortages loom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy also on Monday urged &ldquo;unwavering unity&rdquo; in the U.S. until Ukraine sees &ldquo;peace restored,&rdquo; according to AFP, as the U.S. will see votes cast for midterm elections Tuesday evening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. support for Ukraine could dip if the GOP achieves a majority in the House and Senate after the elections, a possibility increasingly on the table as Republican favorability rose in pre-election polls. Republicans have been more willing than their Democratic counterparts in Congress to express skepticism about the logic behind weapons transfers, and Republican voters consistently fall lower than Democrats in the opinion polls measuring willingness to support Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Republican leaders have doubled down on their stance in support for Ukraine.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celtics' Jaylen Brown disagrees with terms of Kyrie Irving's return to Nets, doesn't think he's antisemitic</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown said on Monday the National Basketball Players Association disagreed with the benchmarks set for Kyrie Irving in order for him to return from his Brooklyn Nets suspension.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving was suspended for at least five games until he adequately came to terms with the harm he caused when he tweeted a link to a movie that spread antisemitic misinformation. According to The Athletic, the terms included an apology, a donation of the agreed-upon sum of $500,000 to organizations that fight hate, complete sensitivity training, complete antisemitic/anti-hate training, meet with Anti-Defamation League and Jewish leaders in Brooklyn and meet again with Nets officials, including team owner Joe Tsai.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown told the Boston Globe on Monday he did not believe Irving was antisemitic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I don't believe Kyrie Irving is antisemitic," he told the paper. "I don't think people in our governing bodies think he's antisemitic. He made a mistake. We understand from an outside perspective how important sensitivity is to not condone hate speech and not condone anything of that nature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We don't want to stand up for somebody in order to not condemn hate speech, but I don't believe Kyrie Irving is antisemitic. And hopefully the NBA feels the same way."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said the players had "discomfort" with the rules, because the current CBA does not include exact guidelines on punishment regarding social media posts. The Washington Post&rsquo;s Candace Buckner noted that Adam Silver fined J.R. Smith in the past for previous social media posts. Irving tweeted a screenshot of the synopsis of the movie.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There is an interesting distinction between what somebody says verbally and what somebody posts as a link on a platform with no description behind it," Brown said. "Some people will argue there's no difference and some people will argue there is a difference. There's no language in our CBA. There's no rules against it. This is uncharted territory for everybody.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The terms in which he has to fulfill to return, I think not just speaking for me, speaking as a vice president from a lot of our players, we didn't agree with the terms that was required for him to come back, and we're waiting for this Tuesday meeting to happen to see what comes of it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown and Irving are vice presidents of the players union. Irving met with NBA commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning ladies and gentleman, this is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, November 9th, 2022. The midterm elections are still in full swing in some states, as results are still trickling in&hellip; let&rsquo;s get to the news:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As things stand now according to the Associated Press:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP leads the democrats with 47-46 seats taken. 51 is needed for majority.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the house, the GOP leads with 199 seats to the democrats 174 seats. 218 seats are needed for majority.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Arizona, currently democrat Katie Hobbs holds a slim lead over Republican Kari Lake, with 66% of the vote reporting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Oregon, Tina Kotek the democrat, has a slim lead over Republican Christine Drazen, with 67% of the vote reporting&hellip; and Drazen for those of you who remembered even had the support of one of the Nike founders.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2022/11/09/who-will-republicans-hold-accountable-for-tuesday-night-n2615702"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2022/11/09/who-will-republicans-hold-accountable-for-tuesday-night-n2615702</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Voters Deserve Answers and Accountability</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's no way to sugarcoat it &mdash; Republicans got bamboozled in the midterms. All the polls that we reported showing Republican candidates surging in the final weeks of their campaigns, the race ratings from the Cook Political Report, and the overconfident statements from GOP leaders were all significantly overly optimistic about what we all watched play out on Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were GOP victories &mdash; Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio in Florida, J.D. Vance in Ohio, Ted Budd in North Carolina, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Jen Kiggans in Virginia, to name a few &mdash; but conservatives were sold a false bill of goods from the leaders tasked with delivering GOP majorities. Those promising great success in order to consolidate power, in a drapes-measuring move, hoping to land a leadership position in a new Republican majority may be the worst offenders who owe the Republican electorate the most answers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them are the leadership of the Republican National Committee, including Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the chairs of the National Republican Congressional Committee &mdash; Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) &mdash; and National Republican Senatorial Committee &mdash; Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), and the House Republican Leader &mdash; Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an election year that favored Republicans purely for its timing as the first midterm of the Biden administration, an advantage that should have been helped by a president with chronically underwater approval, inflation above eight percent, surging crime and drug overdose crises, a wide open border, and so many more reasons, there's no reason Republican candidates should have performed as poorly as they did.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://redstate.com/bonchie/2022/11/09/breaking-pennsylvania-senate-race-called-n655867"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://redstate.com/bonchie/2022/11/09/breaking-pennsylvania-senate-race-called-n655867</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania Senate Race Called for Fetterman</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat John Fetterman has won the Pennsylvania US senate election against Republican Mehmet Oz. The race ended up close, but Fetterman&rsquo;s overperformance with blue-collar voters pushed him over the finish line. He will now head to Washington, DC, in January as part of what will almost certainly remain a Democrat-controlled Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can you say? The Republican Party lost to a man who is not cognitively all there. As Matt Walsh put it: The Republican Party outside of Florida has no message. No discipline. No leadership. No courage to confront the important issues head on. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re losing to literally brain damaged candidates. We need a total overhaul.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I think I like Jeff Durbin&rsquo;s take better: &ldquo;Our nation won't see meaningful and lasting change apart from Christ through any election. Transformation comes through regeneration and repentance. Hope is in the King and not the legislature. Red without His blood is meaningless. Conservative without Christ is futile.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Results in Nevada Senate race delayed due to paper ballots</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada's midterm election results have been delayed, according to local election officials, leaving the state's high-stakes Senate race outcome in the balance as of early Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving the news: Two counties where the vast majority of Nevada voters reside aren't expected to start counting some mail-in ballots until Wednesday, The Nevada Independent reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Clark County, a shortage of election workers was causing the delay, while Washoe County received large volumes of mail and drop-off ballots, per the Independent, which spoke to county officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada state law also allows mail-in ballots to arrive days after Election Day so long as they are postmarked by Nov. 8, per Forbes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada's race is one of four key Senate battlegrounds that remained uncalled early Wednesday. Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona are also unresolved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they're saying: "Clark is not counting drop boxes tonight, but, to be clear, we said all along that we would only have some of the results on election night," Jennifer Russell, a spokesperson for the Nevada secretary of state, told NBC News Tuesday. "By law, Nevada counties have until Nov. 12 to receive mail ballots."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We're all used to elections where it was as simple as plugging in USB sticks and running the results," Bethany Drysdale, a spokesperson for Washoe County, told the Reno Gazette Journal. "We can't do that now because there are so many paper ballots. It's going to take longer. This is the new normal for election night."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/2022-midterm-elections-voting-results-predictions-candidates-updates"><strong>https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/2022-midterm-elections-voting-results-predictions-candidates-updates</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key races across the country still being called, House, Senate majorities still up for grabs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Senate results: Warnock, Walker tell supporters to hang tight with race too close to call</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Senate race in Georgia does not have a clear winner as neither incumbent Democrat Sen. Raphael Warnock nor his Republican challenger Herschel Walker have claimed an outright majority of the vote so far.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Wednesday morning, the race is too close to call, according to the Fox News Decision Desk, with more than 3.8 million ballots cast and Warnock leading Walker by approximately 35,000 votes. Warnock holds 49.42% of the vote, with 1,935,464 votes in his favor, and Walker has 48.52% with 1,900,168 votes. Third-party candidate Chase Oliver has 80,895 votes with 97.94% of precincts reporting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia law requires a candidate to surpass 50% of the vote to win an election, and a runoff between the top two vote-getters will be held on Dec. 6 if no candidate meets that requirement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stacey Abrams, after election loss, vows 'I won&rsquo;t stop running for a better Georgia'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams lost to Gov. Brian Kemp for the second time on Tuesday, but indicated that she does not plan on exiting the political arena.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams gave a concession speech on Election Night&nbsp; after results showed that she had lost to Kemp in a race that was not particularly close.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams famously declined to formally concede to Kemp in 2018 after a narrow defeat, claiming at the time that the election was rigged by voter suppression. This time around, she made no such claim and only looked to the future.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Alabama election results: Republican Katie Britt becomes state's first female elected senator</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Katie Britt has made history by becoming the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The self-described 40-year-old "mama on a mission" is projected by Fox News&rsquo; Decision Desk to defeat Democrat Will Boyd after, so far, capturing around two thirds of the vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Republican George Santos flips Democratic House seat in New York</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican George Santos flipped New York&rsquo;s 3rd Congressional district Wednesday and secured another House seat for the GOP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santos defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman, who was vying to fill the Long Island seat after Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi announced he would be retiring to take a stab at New York governor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suozzi came in a distant third in the Democratic primaries in the governor&rsquo;s race, but Santos secured his place in Congress by running on cutting taxes, boosting border security and rallying against cashless bail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press called the race shortly after 1:30 a.m. once the Republican held a lead of 54.2% of the vote over Zimmerman&rsquo;s 45.8%, with 90% of the votes already counted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s worth noting that Santos is a homosexual&hellip; so we need to be praying for his repentance on that front.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Squad&rsquo; rolls to easy victories in House races</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the worst news of the day&hellip; The progressive House members collectively known as the &ldquo;Squad&rdquo; easily won reelection in their respective elections on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Cori Bush, D-Mo., and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., were all projected by The Associated Press as winning by wide margins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowman, who represents New York's 16th Congressional District comprising parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, had the slimmest margin of victory and yet still was leading 65%-34% against Republican challenger Miriam Flisser, with more than 91% of results reporting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley, and Tlaib were the founding members of the "Squad," who gained notoriety as freshman lawmakers after the 2018 election for pushing the Democratic House conference to the left. Bush and Bowman joined the informal group after winning election in 2020.</span></p>

<p><strong>Kentucky voters reject constitutional amendment declaring no right to abortion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in Republican-leaning Kentucky have rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have denied any right to abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of Tuesday&rsquo;s election comes months after the Supreme Court overturned the right to abortion in a decision that has led to near-total bans in a dozen states, including in Kentucky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ballot question had asked Kentuckians if they wanted to amend the constitution to say: "To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outcome highlights a gap between voters and the state&rsquo;s Republican-controlled Legislature, which added the proposed amendment to the 2022 general election slate a year ago in a move some thought would drive more conservative voters to the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While seen as an important win for abortion-rights advocates, the amendment's defeat will have no practical impact on the right to an abortion if a sweeping ban on the procedure approved by lawmakers survives a legal challenge presently before the state Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><strong>Michigan voters pass measure protecting abortion rights, other pregnancy-related decisions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people of the state of Michigan voted in favor of a new measure that protects abortion and other decisions related to reproduction and pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposal 3 amends the state constitution by adding rights to abortion and contraception. It states that everyone has a "fundamental right to reproductive freedom," defining this as including -- but not being limited to -- "prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management, and infertility care."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure also allows the state to regulate abortion after the time a fetus becomes viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approval of the proposal came months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which gave states the power to protect or ban abortion. The decision in June lead to near-total bans in a dozen states and was a hot topic leading up to the midterms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The passing of the proposal puts a definitive end to a 1931 ban on abortion that had been blocked in court, but could have been reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents to the measure said protecting abortion rights could have far-reaching effects on other laws in the state, such as one requiring parental notification of an abortion for someone under age 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal experts said changes to other laws would only happen if someone sued and won, a process that could take years and has no certainty of success, The Associated Press reported.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cornerstone Work &amp; Worldview Institute:</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/11/brooklyn-nets-reportedly-have-6-demands-including-sensitivity-training-that-kyrie-irving-must-meet-in-order-to-be-reinstated/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/11/brooklyn-nets-reportedly-have-6-demands-including-sensitivity-training-that-kyrie-irving-must-meet-in-order-to-be-reinstated/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn Nets Reportedly Have 6 Demands Including Sensitivity Training That Kyrie Irving Must Meet In Order To Be Reinstated</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new report claims the Brooklyn Nets have at least six demands Kyrie Irving must meet in order for him to be reinstated for the team after they suspended him for sharing a movie link to his Twitter account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving was indefinitely suspended after he shared an Amazon link to the film Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America The Movie to his Twitter account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the suspension announcement, Irving apologized for sharing the movie link.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now a new report from The Athletic&rsquo;s Shams Charania claims the Nets have six demands Irving must meet in order to return to the team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charania wrote on Twitter, &ldquo;Sources: Nets have delivered Kyrie Irving six items he must complete to return to team: &ndash; Apologize/condemn movie &ndash; $500K donation to anti-hate causes &ndash; Sensitivity training &ndash; Antisemitic training &ndash; Meet with ADL, Jewish leaders &ndash; Meet with Joe Tsai to demonstrate understanding.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unclear how legitimate these demands are given Irving had previously announced in a joint statement with the NBA and the Anti-Defamation League that he would donate $500,000 to the Anti-Defamation League.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADL rejected Irving&rsquo;s donation with the organization&rsquo;s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt responding to Irving&rsquo;s apology. YouTuber Ryan Kinel of Sports Wars reacted to this list of demands and the actions the Brooklyn Nets and the NBA have taken against Irving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WARNING: A few spots of language:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>This week in the thought of Thomas Aquinas, we examine the idea of natural law, and conclude that, as articulated by Aquinas, it is an idea that gives unwarranted scope to human reason, and effectively makes God equal with His law. In contrast, Scripture teaches that God is the source of all definition, and that human law must be positivized in an historical context.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Liberty Dispatch</strong> ~ November 8, 2022</p>
<p class="p1">On this episode of Liberty Dispatch, hosts Andrew and Matty recap the week that was in the Public Emergency Order Commission in the&nbsp;<em>Week-In-Review</em>. They also examine the Toronto District School Board's overtly Marxist student census, and how it is a bad omen for Ontario education, they also examine the radical Bill C-11 which will change the nature of Canadian media for the worse.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief, for Tuesday, November 8th, 2022. I hope you all had a wonderful weekend with you and yours. And happy election day by the way! Get out and VOTE today, as it is our duty as Christians to work to shape this nation in God&rsquo;s image. Without further adieu, let&rsquo;s get you caught up on the news:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-elon-musk-endorses-gop-in-midterms?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-elon-musk-endorses-gop-in-midterms?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk endorses GOP in midterms</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet posted on Monday morning, less than 24 hours before Election Day, new Twitter owner Elon Musk recommended that Americans vote for Republican candidates during their visit to the polls tomorrow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet addressed to "independent-minded voters," Musk wrote, "Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v153b3f-elon-musk-says-he-will-vote-for-republicans-this-election.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v153b3f-elon-musk-says-he-will-vote-for-republicans-this-election.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk&rsquo;s tweet comes as Republican candidates in key states have either taken the lead or have come within striking distance of their Democrat counterparts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Arizona&rsquo;s Senate race, incumbent Mark Kelly is up just one point, according to RealClearPolitics&rsquo; average of polls. In the state&rsquo;s gubernatorial race, Republican candidate Kari Lake is up 1.8 points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pennsylvania, GOP Senate candidate Mehmet Oz is up 0.1 percent over Democrat John Letterman. In a poll from Trafalgar, Republican candidate Doug Mastriano is down just 4.3 points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blue state of New York, gubernatorial incumbent Kathy Hochul holds a 6.2 point lead over Lee Zeldin, who has quickly closed the gap ahead of Election Day. Independent polls have pointed to Zeldin taking the lead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Florida&rsquo;s governor race, incumbent Ron DeSantis holds an 11.5 point lead over Democrat challenger Charlie Crist, according to RealClearPolitics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in the deep blue states on the west coast, Republican challengers are closing the gap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/consumer-confidence-in-housing-hits-new-low-says-fannie-mae.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/consumer-confidence-in-housing-hits-new-low-says-fannie-mae.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer confidence in the housing market hits a new low, according to Fannie Mae</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising mortgage rates, high home prices and uncertainty in the overall economy have Americans feeling more pessimistic about the state of the housing market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, just 16% of consumers said they thought now is a good time to buy a home, according to a monthly survey by Fannie Mae. That is the lowest share since the survey began in 2011. The share of respondents who thought now is a good time to sell a home also dropped from 59% to 51%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fannie Mae&rsquo;s survey looks not just at buying and selling but tests sentiment about home prices, mortgage rates and the job market. It combines them all into one number, which also fell for the eighth straight month and now sits at a new low.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A higher share of consumers, 37%, said they expect home prices to drop in the next 12 months. That compares with 35% in September. More also believe mortgage rates will rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-rising interest rates are what turned the red-hot housing market on its heels in early summer. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage started the year near a record low, around 3%. By June it crossed 6%, and it&rsquo;s now just over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As continued affordability constraints reduce homebuyer demand, and homeowners become reluctant to sell at potentially reduced prices, we expect home sales to slow even further in the coming months, consistent with our forecast,&rdquo; wrote Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae&rsquo;s chief economist, in a release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home prices dropped again in September, according to Black Knight, albeit at a slower monthly pace than they did in July and August. Prices are now down 2.6% since June, the first three-month decline since 2018, when interest rates also rose. It is the worst three-month stretch for home prices since early 2009. Prices, however, were still 10.7% higher in September than the same month last year.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Blocks NY Gun Law, Excoriates Democrats Trying To &lsquo;Eviscerate The Bill Of Rights&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Trump-appointed judge in New York last week blocked a gun law from taking effect and took Democrats to task for trying to &ldquo;eviscerate the Bill of Rights.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge John Sinatra Jr. issued an injunction blocking a gun law that bars people in New York from bearing arms in places of worship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The court reiterates that ample Supreme Court precedent addressing the individuals right to keep and bear arms &ndash; from Heller and McDonald to its June 2022 decision in [New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen] &ndash; dictates that New York&rsquo;s new place of worship restriction is equally unconstitutional,&rdquo; Sinatra said, The Daily Caller reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Constitution and the Bill of Rights are the Status quo &ndash; not 2022 legislation on the books for nine weeks,&rdquo; the judge continued, taking aim at the Democrat-controlled New York legislature. &ldquo;Legislative enactments may not eviscerate the Bill of Rights. Every day they do is one too many.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The nation&rsquo;s history does not countenance such an incursion into the right to keep and bear arms across all places of worship across the state,&rdquo; Sinatra wrote. &ldquo;The right to self defense is no less important and no less recognized at these places.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal judge in October issued a temporary hold on the law, similarly writing, &ldquo;In Bruen, the Court made the Second Amendment test crystal clear: regulations in this area is permissible only if the government demonstrates that the regulation is consistent with the Nation&rsquo;s historical tradition of sufficiently analogous regulations. &hellip; New York fails that test. The State&rsquo;s exclusion is, instead, inconsistent with the Nation&rsquo;s historical traditions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen decision, the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that longtime restrictions New York placed on carrying concealed firearms run in violation of Americans&rsquo; Second and 14th Amendment rights, The Daily Wire reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case centered on a 1911 New York state law that conditioned the right to a concealed carry permit on &ldquo;good moral character&rdquo; and &ldquo;proper cause.&rdquo; The Supreme Court majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, took issue with the latter condition, which unlawfully forced New Yorkers to demonstrate &ldquo;a special need for self-defense.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need,&rdquo; Thomas wrote. &ldquo;That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant&rsquo;s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Press sec says Biden's 'words were twisted' when he said he wanted to shut down coal plants</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a White House press briefing on Monday, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about Joe Biden's remarks on Friday where he promised to shut down coal plants across the country and she said it was "a bit loud and hard to hear."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v1sb6as-november-7-2022.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v1sb6as-november-7-2022.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Biden promised to permanently end coal production in the United States while speaking in Carlsbad, California at a political event "touting his administration's economic policies."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden claimed that the US is going to "become a wind generation" and "it&rsquo;s going to save them a hell of a lot of money and using the same transmission line that they transmitted the coal-fired electric on, we're going to be shutting these plants down all across America and having wind and solar power."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, said on Saturday that President Biden's comments were "outrageous" and that the president owed coal miners an "immediate and public apology."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Manchin's response, Jean-Pierre put out a statement that read, "The President&rsquo;s remarks yesterday have been twisted to suggest a meaning that was not intended; he regrets it if anyone hearing these remarks took offense."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The President was commenting on a fact of economics and technology: as it has been from its earliest days as an energy superpower, America is once again in the midst of an energy transition," the statement read, indicating that the US must embrace "clean and efficient American energy."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court Orders Release of True the Vote Leaders From Jail</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two leaders of the election integrity group True the Vote were released from jail after an appeals court overruled a judge&rsquo;s order that they be detained for contempt of court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips were ordered released by a panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit late on Nov. 6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;IT IS ORDERED that Petitioners&rsquo; opposed motion for release from detention is GRANTED pending further order of this court,&rdquo; the panel said in the order, which was obtained by The Epoch Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel consisted of Circuit Judges Catharina Haynes, a George W. Bush appointee; Kurt Engelhardt, a Donald Trump appointee; and Andrew Oldham, a Trump appointee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht and Phillips were released on Nov. 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht and Phillips were sent to jail on Oct. 31 by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt, a Reagan appointee, who found them in contempt of court for not revealing the identities of people who allegedly accessed information from Konnech, a Michigan-based election management software company whose founder was recently arrested for allegedly stealing poll worker data and hosting the information on servers in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order for confinement was to be in place until the defendants &ldquo;fully comply&rdquo; with an order that they reveal certain information, including the identities, Hoyt said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht and Phillips say they passed on information that was legally obtained from Konnech to the FBI. One of their attorneys identified one of the individuals in question, Mike Hasson, during an October hearing. But they have declined to share the name of the second person. Both the individuals are FBI informants, Phillips asserted during one hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contempt order came after Konnech sued True the Vote and its founders for defamation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its opposition to the petition, Konnech said that the True the Vote founders were trying to &ldquo;strip the District Court of its contempt power&rdquo; and that they &ldquo;have no one but themselves to blame for their confinement&rdquo; after defying Hoyt&rsquo;s order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers for the firm said, &ldquo;Petitioners&rsquo; imprisonment is not an emergency especially in this case where the Petitioners are contemnors and recalcitrant witnesses who hold the keys to the jailhouse, and can free themselves immediately upon purging their contempt.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Houston Astros, did this:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/06/dusty-baker-finally-wins-world-series-as-a-manager/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/11/06/dusty-baker-finally-wins-world-series-as-a-manager/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOUSTON &mdash; The Astros&rsquo; manager stood on the stage where the World Series trophy was presented late Saturday night and channeled his inner Jimmy Johnson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;How about those Astros!&rdquo; Dusty Baker said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 25 seasons managing in the major leagues and two previous trips to the World Series, Baker is finally a world champion manager. With the Astros&rsquo; 4-1 victory over the Phillies in Game 6, the 73-year-old Baker became the oldest manager to lead a team to a World Series title.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hired to stabilize the organization before the 2020 season &mdash; in the aftermath of the team&rsquo;s sign-stealing scheme from 2017 that cost former manager A.J. Hinch his job &mdash; Baker might now be the most popular man in Texas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker took the Giants to Game 7 of the World Series in 2002 before they lost to the Angels. Under his guidance last season, the Astros made it to the World Series before losing to the Braves in six games.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Astros rolled to the AL West title this season, winning 106 games, before starting the postseason 7-0 with ALDS and ALCS sweeps of the Mariners and Yankees, respectively. The Phillies, however, jumped ahead 2-1 in the World Series, before the Astros closed it out with three straight victories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are projected to have a good night on Nov. 8 in the Senate, according to a new forecast released Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model from RealClearPolitics shows that the GOP will control the Senate with 54 seats, as compared to Democrats&rsquo; 46 seats. It predicted that Republicans will now likely take seats in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes as recent polls signaled that Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with the direction the United States is heading. One from Gallup found that 17 percent of respondents said they&rsquo;re satisfied with where the country is going, which is the worst of any midterm since at least 1982, according to the pollster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, decades-high inflation appears to remain the top issue for many voters. A poll from Quinnipiac released Wednesday found that 36 percent of voters view inflation as the top issue, which far outpaces the No. 2 choice, abortion, which garnered 10 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have targeted the Biden administration and Democratic policies as a primary cause of decades-high inflation. They&rsquo;ve also said that polices around oil drilling and COVID-19 lockdowns have harmed the U.S. economy and that Democrats are to blame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that poll, 34 percent said that they believe President Joe Biden is handling the economy well, whereas 61 percent said he isn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden and members of his party have focused on abortion following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s historic reversal of Roe v. Wade over the summer as well as accusing Republicans and supporters of former President Donald Trump of being extremists who will undermine U.S. institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday evening, Biden continued that trend and attempted to tie the alleged attack targeting Paul Pelosi to claims that the 2020 election was stolen. The suspect in that incident last week, David DePape, was known to be involved in far left-wing circles and reportedly had a history of mental illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several polling analysts on Wednesday told The Epoch Times that polls&mdash;even those that show Republicans pulling slightly ahead of Democrat candidates&mdash;could suffer from a &ldquo;bandwagon effect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poll results from FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics, and others like The New York Times have frequently favored Democrats in Senate and gubernatorial races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Lonny Leitner, vice president of the government affairs firm LS2 Group, said that many polls don&rsquo;t sample enough people.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2022/11/01/kari-lake-takes-another-blowtorch-to-the-media-over-hobbs-hq-break-in-n2615240"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2022/11/01/kari-lake-takes-another-blowtorch-to-the-media-over-hobbs-hq-break-in-n2615240</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kari Lake Torches the Media: You Idiots Will Fall for Anything</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona secretary of state and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs is desperate. Her Hail Mary throw in the waning days of the 2022 cycle was akin to some pathetic exercise to remind voters there&rsquo;s a Democrat on the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, there was a break-in at her campaign headquarters where Hobbs, without evidence, accused Republican opponent Kari Lake of inspiring the burglary. The media ran with it, but Lake is just too good at slapping down narratives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when Lake was recently asked about being an "election denier," she shut it down by sharing statements&nbsp; dating back to 2000 from a slew of high-profile Democrats who questioned our elections where Republicans won. With Hobbs hiding in the bunker, even refusing to take questions about the break-in, Lake trots out there and torches the media over how their narrative about this event aged like milk. The culprit who broke into Hobbs&rsquo; campaign office was arrested, and there&rsquo;s no evidence that the attack was politically motivated</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knows how to counterpunch, especially on the narratives where the liberal media can mount no defense because they&rsquo;re wrong. There are no shades of gray or nuance&mdash;nothing politically motivated about the Hobbs campaign office incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doubled down her attack on the press:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1585777715906457600"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1585777715906457600</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wouldn&rsquo;t be asking a question that&rsquo;s for sure&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake has been making the most of her free media opportunities, leading to an impressive poll surge. Recent surveys have Lake ahead, including liberal polls&mdash;Data for Progress has her leading Hobbs by four points. Most attempts to smear Lake as a crank have been mitigated by her two-decade career as a television journalist; Arizona voters are familiar with Lake. Hobbs&rsquo; antics could have been avoided if she had just agreed to debate Lake, but it&rsquo;s too late for that, and the Arizona Democrat most likely would have been eviscerated on the stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, you nominated an atrocious candidate for whatever reason, and now you can&rsquo;t do much with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Arizona to Ohio we go&hellip;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://humanevents.com/2022/11/03/ohio-education-board-vp-insists-biological-sex-is-not-a-scientific-fact?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://humanevents.com/2022/11/03/ohio-education-board-vp-insists-biological-sex-is-not-a-scientific-fact?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio Education Board VP Insists Biological Sex Is Not a 'Scientific Fact'</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vice president of the Ohio State Board of Education does not know what the definition of biological sex is, and does not think it is a scientific fact to say that there is just one definition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha Manchester, who holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Education and has served on the State Board since Jan 2017, made the comments at an executive committee meeting convened to debate a resolution that seeks to reject Biden&rsquo;s proposed Title IX change adding gender identity as a protected characteristic alongside sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution, titled &ldquo;Resolution to support parents, schools, and districts in rejecting harmful, coercive, and burdensome gender identity policies and to protect federal funding subject to Title IX&rdquo; was introduced in September by board member Brandon Shea. It argues that &ldquo;sex is not arbitrarily &lsquo;assigned at birth&rsquo; but rather identifies an unchangeable fact&rdquo; and suggests that the Title IX change would &ldquo;require that K-12 schools socially transition minor children to a different gender without requiring parental consent.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A video clip of the vice president&rsquo;s confusion during the debate about the most fundamental fact of human existence was shared on Twitter by child-safeguarding advocate Chris Elston.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1587901632955961344"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1587901632955961344</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchester&rsquo;s confusion about such a basic fact of biology evidently stems from gender identity ideology pushing the idea that sex is complicated and impossible to define. Google &ldquo;What is biological sex?&rdquo; and the first page of hits contains a baffling array of articles about how sex is complex and there are more than two sexes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the top spot is Planned Parenthood, telling readers that the term biological sex &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t fully capture the complex biological, anatomical, and chromosomal variations that can occur. Having only two options (biological male or biological female) might not describe what&rsquo;s going on inside a person&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an article titled The Myth of Biological sex, Forbes informs readers that &ldquo;there is no one parameter that makes a person biologically male or female.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is simply not true. Sex is defined by which gamete type the reproductive system developed to produce. Males have the reproductive capacity to produce small gametes (sperm), and females have the reproductive capacity to produce large gametes (eggs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to push the idea that the categories of male and female are blurry or don&rsquo;t exist and that therefore males can be women if they say so, a favorite tactic of trans activists is to use people who are born with Disorders of Sex Development (DSDs) as pawns in their linguistic game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activists will point to people born with X0 Turner syndrome for example and suggest that these individuals are neither male nor female, ignoring the fact that Turner syndrome is a DSD that can only affect females. This exact argument was made by expert witness Dr. Greta Bauer in the hearing of a Canadian nurse on trial in British Columbia for allegedly transphobic beliefs, one of which is the belief that there are only two sexes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive committee voted to hold an additional meeting on Nov 14 to continue the debate, according to WOWK 13 News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving overseas&hellip;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-south-korea-threaten-end-kim-regime-north-korea-uses-nuclear-weapon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-south-korea-threaten-end-kim-regime-north-korea-uses-nuclear-weapon</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US, South Korea threaten to 'end' Kim regime if North Korea uses nuclear weapon</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and South Korea issued a joint warning to North Korea on Thursday, warning that any use of nuclear weapons would result in the end of Kim Jong Un's regime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea fired an unprecedented 23 missiles in a single day on Wednesday amid extensive joint air force exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. Kim's regime has made veiled threats about nuclear weapons in recent days as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Any nuclear attack against the United States or its allies and partners, including the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim regime," South Korean Defense Minister Jong-Sup Lee said Thursday, in a joint news conference with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and South Korean militaries announced an extension to a joint air force exercise earlier on Thursday. The move came in response to North Korea launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and two short-range missiles after Wednesday's barrage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Korean media reported that officials believe the North's ICBM failed in flight but did not elaborate. Meanwhile, North Korea's two short-range ballistic missiles fell into the sea to its east. Japan initially sounded alarms after tracking suggested the ICBM would fly over the island nation, but officials later said they lost track of it mid-flight, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea has grown increasingly aggressive since the U.S. and South Korea began joint military exercises in September. The country also flew 12 warplanes near the South Korean border in early October. The sortie included eight fighter jets and four bombers. South Korea responded with a flight of 30 warplanes, but the two groups did not engage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and South Korea's joint air force exercise, Operation Vigilant Storm, was scheduled to end Friday but will now extend into the weekend following North Korea's launches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Korea had a failed missile launch of its own in October. The malfunction came as the U.S., South Korea and Japan were seeking to send a message to the North Korean regime after it sent its own ballistic missile flying over the island of Japan. U.S. military officials clarified that the warhead on South Korea's missile did not explode, but the propellant caused a large blast and flames.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No injuries were reported from the incident, civilian or otherwise, and South Korean officials say no buildings were damaged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now y&rsquo;all know what time it is&hellip; my favorite topic, sports!!!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/01/philly-restaurants-refused-to-serve-astros-before-game-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/11/01/philly-restaurants-refused-to-serve-astros-before-game-3/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loyalty is Philly Special.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Series intensity in the City of Brotherly Love was amplified when two local businesses refused to feed the Astros ahead of Game 3 on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angelo&rsquo;s Pizzeria in South Philadelphia, an institution in the city, refused to provide catering for the visitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;d cook for the Astros, you&rsquo;re out of your mind,&rdquo; a man said in a video posted to the eatery&rsquo;s Instagram account. &ldquo;We said no to them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Astros didn&rsquo;t have much luck at Mike&rsquo;s BBQ, either. The restaurant posted a text exchange with the team that didn&rsquo;t seem to get very far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Houston is widely loathed by a number of fanbases across MLB &mdash; and at least one Phillies player on the roster &mdash; the treatment might not have anything to do with the franchise&rsquo;s recent history of cheating. It seems more likely it&rsquo;s just a good old fashion dose of Philly hospitality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Astros didn&rsquo;t get any reprieve on the field as the Phillies routed them 7-0 in Game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead after Tuesday&rsquo;s game was postponed due to rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phillies crushed five homers with Bryce Harper getting the festivities started with a two-run blast in the first inning. The Phillies are now 6-0 this postseason at Citizens Bank Park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A lot of really good hitters in the lineup,&rdquo; said third baseman Alec Bohm, who added a solo shot to leadoff the second inning against Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games 4 and 5 are in Philadelphia on Wednesday and Thursday night as the Astros look to fight back in series &mdash; and find a place that will serve them food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we go from pettiness, to a genuinely disturbing story&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/11/four-players-suspended-after-brawl-breaks-out-after-msu-vs-michigan-game/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/11/four-players-suspended-after-brawl-breaks-out-after-msu-vs-michigan-game/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four Players Suspended After Brawl Breaks Out After MSU Vs. Michigan Game</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An altercation broke out between players following the Michigan-Michigan State game on Saturday. A crowd of Michigan State Spartans appeared to be attacking Michigan players in the tunnel following the in-state rivalry game. Michigan AD Ward Manuel said Michigan&rsquo;s postgame fight is being reviewed by law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Michigan Police Assistant Chief Melissa Overton said the investigation is ongoing, working in conjunction with the Michigan State Police and Michigan&rsquo;s athletics and football programs. Spartans head coach Mel Tucker said Michigan is working with law enforcement, the Michigan campus leadership, and the Big Ten Conference to assess what happened, including identifying additional players involved and contributing factors in the altercation. Tucker added that the suspensions will stay in place until the investigation, which includes law enforcement, Big Ten, and Michigan, is completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Mel Tucker suspended Four Michigan State players &ndash; Tank Brown, Khary Crump, Angelo Gore, and Zion Young, saying that decisions were made based on video evidence from the incident. Neither Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh nor Manuel would disclose on Saturday which Wolverines were involved in the altercation, although Harbaugh said two players were involved &ndash; one, he said, suffered a nasal injury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the immediate aftermath on Saturday evening, MSU coach Mel Tucker said at his postgame news conference that he was not aware of any altercations after the game between the Michigan players inside the Michigan Stadiums tunnel and that a fact-finding process was underway. The suspensions were ordered after school officials reviewed video of Saturday&rsquo;s 29-7 loss to host team Michigan in Ann Arbor and discovered the four were part of a group of teammates surrounding a rival, Michigan coach Mel Tucker said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident comes amidst a frustrating season for the Spartans. The 29-7 loss to Michigan puts Michigan State at 3-5 overall and 1-4 within their conference, last in the East division. With games looming against #14 Illinois and $16 Penn State, MSU is in real danger of not reaching bowl eligibility. A result that would add further embarrassment to a proud program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&rsquo;s my take&hellip; those players who jumped the Michigan players, should be expelled from Michigan State, and should never put the pads on again&hellip; what an absolute disgrace.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In June, the United States Supreme Court decided a 2nd Amendment controversy and reversed <em>Roe v. Wade</em> citing William Blackstone&rsquo;s Commentaries on the Laws of England as authority. After you listen, you will be astounded to learn how much the cosmology of Genesis Chapters 1 through 3 informed Blackstone&rsquo;s description of the nature of law. You will know what even most Christian lawyers don&rsquo;t know about law.</p>]]></description>

All biblical language must be interpreted in light of how it's used elsewhere in the Bible.

The basic principles of hermeneutics should always direct how we read and understand the prophetic passages of the Bible.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Thursday, November 3rd, 2022. Good to be back with you all, let&rsquo;s get right into the news!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new statement hinted at that policy change, saying when determining future hikes, the Fed &ldquo;will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists are hoping this is the much talked about &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&rsquo;s statement also expanded on previous language simply declaring that &ldquo;ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.&ldquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new language read, &ldquo;The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks initially rose following the announcement, but turned negative during Chairman Jerome Powell&rsquo;s news conference as the market tried to gauge whether the Fed thinks it can implement a less restrictive policy that would include a slower pace of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On balance, Powell dismissed the idea that the Fed may be pausing soon though he said he expects a discussion at the next meeting or two about slowing the pace of tightening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also reiterated that it may take resolve and patience to get inflation down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the Fed&rsquo;s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago &ndash; 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing demand has plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn&rsquo;t as bad as feared but also due to growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.09%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just for a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/bidens-cdc-replaces-word-woman-with-pregnant-person-in-flu-vaccine-guidance?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/bidens-cdc-replaces-word-woman-with-pregnant-person-in-flu-vaccine-guidance?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's CDC replaces word 'woman' with 'pregnant person' in flu vaccine guidance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has removed the word woman from sections of its safety guidance on flu vaccines during pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, gendered terms such as woman, women, mother and she/her pronouns were all erased from the Q &amp; A section of the Flu Vaccine Safety and Pregnancy page in August of last year. The words were replaced with gender-neutral language such as &ldquo;pregnant people&rdquo; and the gender-neutral pronoun &ldquo;their.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the words woman and mother still appear in other sections of the CDC website, such as the Vaccines During Pregnancy FAQ page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Influenza is more likely to cause severe illness in pregnant people,&rdquo; says the CDC. &ldquo;Flu shots given during pregnancy help protect the &lsquo;pregnant parent&rsquo; and the baby from flu.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those advocating for the use of gender-neutral language in the healthcare setting argue that the intention is to ensure that everyone feels included.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for example because a tiny number of females who identify as men may become pregnant, the word woman should be removed from maternity care to include them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But feminist campaigners have suggested that the so-called inclusive language only appears to go one way. Ovarian cancer apparently now affects &ldquo;people&rdquo; not women, but prostate cancer still affects men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthline referred to &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;vulva-owners&rdquo; last year on its HPV information pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, MedicineNet.com kept the definition of male as &ldquo;the sex that produces spermatozoa&rdquo; but redefined female as being a complicated mix of chromosomal anomalies and gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has led some to speculate that this new inclusive language is not so much about being inclusive of everybody and more about ensuring that the word woman is never used in a way that excludes males who identify as women, while at the same time not reminding those males of their biology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&rsquo;s culture shifts like sand. But New Saint Andrews College is established on Christ, the immovable rock. It is a premier institution that forges evangelical leaders who don&rsquo;t fear or hate the world. Guided by God&rsquo;s Word, they take the world back because they&rsquo;re equipped with the genius of classical liberal arts and God-honoring wisdom, thanks to a faculty dedicated to academic rigor and to God&rsquo;s kingdom.Find out more, at nsa.edu/</span></p>

<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/nation/economy/facebook-stock-down-70-down-800-billion-market-cap-year-nears-end"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/nation/economy/facebook-stock-down-70-down-800-billion-market-cap-year-nears-end</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors reportedly disgruntled as Facebook stock down 70%, company out $800 billion in market cap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors in Facebook parent company Meta are reportedly growing dissatisfied with the company's fixation on the "metaverse" as the corporations' stock continues to plunge and its market capitalization continues a long slide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has seen its stock plummet throughout 2022, shedding more than 70% of its value from the start of the year as it fell from over $330 per share in January to nearly $90 per share this week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company's market cap has also plunged from its high last year, dropping from just over $1 trillion in August of 2021 to under $250 billion in November.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors, meanwhile, are reported to be unhappy with the company's business direction, specifically founder Mark Zuckerberg's fixation on the virtual reality "metaverse," a project that has generated relatively little excitement outside of esoteric tech circles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Tierney, an investment officer for Meta shareholder AllianceBernstein, told the Financial Times that, had any other company plowed so much money into a strategically dubious project, "you&rsquo;d have activist investors writing letters, proposing alternative slates of directors, demanding change."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Older, an asset manager at Carmignac, claimed that Zuckerberg has been "tone-deaf to the investment community, doubling down on everything."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The timeline for the metaverse is very stretched. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to know if it is the right move for five or 10 years," he told FT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta, meanwhile, told FT that the company "value[s] the opinions of our investors and regularly engage with them to ensure we&rsquo;re aware of their respective perspectives.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas woman who helmed female ISIS battalion sentenced to 20 years in prison</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Fluke-Ekren, a 42-year-old woman who grew up on a farm in Overbrook, Kansas, was sentenced to two decades in prison on Tuesday for leading the Khatiba Nusaybah, an all-female ISIS battalion in Raqqa, Syria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluke-Ekren's own children asked the judge to hand down the maximum sentence, 20 years, during victim impact statements at the hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluke-Ekren tearfully spoke to the judge before her sentencing. "I deeply regret my choices, but I also deeply sympathize with women abused and raped in Syria."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a plea deal made with the government, Fluke-Ekren admitted she translated and analyzed documents taken from the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, after the terrorist attack on the facility in 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She tried to explain to the court some of her actions during the seven years she spent in Syria. "I was afraid of my conduct in Benghazi. I just didn&rsquo;t see a way out."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluke-Ekren also stressed that for most of her time in Syria, she had been just a mother, caring for her several children as well as other children and their mothers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Judge Leonie Brinkema said she did not find Fluke-Ekren&rsquo;s claims "wholly credible," saying she had "downplayed the impact" of her role in the Benghazi attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge continued, "There&rsquo;s no question you were providing material support for a terrorist organization," and emphasized several times during the hearing that was the crime for which Fluke-Ekren would be sentenced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the sentencing hearing, two of Fluke-Ekren&rsquo;s adult children gave emotional statements against their mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layla Ekren was visibly trembling in court for nearly an hour before she got her chance to tell Brinkema that her mother abused her as a child. She told the court about one instance in Syria when the family had lice, and her mother held her down on the ground and poured the medicine on her eyes in an apparent attempt to blind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Assistant U.S. Attorney Raj Parekh laid out the allegations against Fluke-Ekren in a sentencing memo, writing that she urged a woman to commit a suicide bombing and told others that her oldest son was born after she was raped by an American soldier as a way to gain favor with other terrorists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations calls on Israel to get rid of nuclear weapons</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution calling on Israel to dispose of all of its alleged nuclear weapons and to put its nuclear sites under the jurisdiction of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution, led by the UN's First Committee, which deals with nuclear disarmament, passed 152-5 over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt submitted the resolution to the General Assembly in New York with sponsors including the Palestinian Authority and 19 countries including Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, the Jerusalem Post reported.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five countries that opposed the resolution were Canada, Israel, Micronesia, Palau and the United States. Twenty-four countries including European Union members, abstained from the vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel has never admitted to having nuclear weapons but is widely believed to have them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel is one of the few U.N. member states that has not signed the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iran is a signatory on the treaty, but international authorities believe that Tehran may already possess nuclear weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution, on the "risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East," did not include Iran.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution calls on Israel "to accede to the Treaty without further delay, not to develop, produce, test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons, to renounce possession of nuclear weapons and to place all its unsafe guarded nuclear facilities under the full scope of Agency safeguards as an important confidence-building measure among all States of the region and as a step toward enhancing peace and security."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dwyane Wade's Ex-Wife Fears He's 'Pressuring' Zaya Into Name And Gender Change For Financial Gain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dwyane Wade&rsquo;s ex-wife, Siohvaughn Funches-Wade, the star&rsquo;s first wife and mother of his two oldest children, filed paperwork this week asking a judge to postpone their daughter Zaya&rsquo;s sex change until she&rsquo;s 18. In Funches-Wade plea to the judge, she claims the NBA star is exploiting their daughter for financial income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Blast, Funches-Wade has sentiments about Zaya being pressured into the permanent change by Dwayne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have concerns that (Dwyane) may be pressuring our child to move forward with the name and gender change in order to capitalize on the financial opportunities that he has received from companies,&rdquo; she said in her legal filing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing was in response to an August petition by Dwayne asking permission for Zaya to legally change her name from Zion Malachi Airamis Wade to Zaya Malachi Airamis Wade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zaya came out as transgender in 2020 at the age of 12. Dwayne&rsquo;s argument concerning his ex-wife&rsquo;s petition was acknowledging that he is the legal guardian of their children and has the legal right to make decisions on his daughter&rsquo;s behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funch-Wade says during a conversation in April, Dwayne told her &ldquo;a lot of money had been already made, and that additional money will be made in relation to our child&rsquo;s name and gender issue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funch-Wade alleges her ex-husband only informs her of their children&rsquo;s life choices out of &lsquo;courtesy&rsquo; but states she wants to be hands-on in all decisions affecting the children. She also claims he is legally required to consult her on &ldquo;major decisions affecting care, welfare, activities, health, education and religious upbringing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funch-Wade and Dwayne will have a hearing in December to determine whether Zaya can change her name and sex without her agreement.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Mere Christianity might be the most important work of apologetics in the last 100 years or more. Copies sold are in the millions. But it is not only a popular success, it is a profoundly insightful and deep work--C. S. Lewis understood the Christian faith better than any other writer in living memory, with the possible exception of G. K. Chesterton. Today the Pugsters reflect on the riches of Lewis's greatest apologetic work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justice Roberts blocks House committee from obtaining Trump tax returns</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has granted an administrative stay of a lower court order that prevents the House Ways and Means Committee from accessing Trump's tax returns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stay is temporary and will last until the court considers a final decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the former president asked the Supreme Court to block the House Ways and Means Committee from accessing his tax returns after it requested six years' worth of Trump's returns as part of an investigation into IRS audit practices of presidents and vice presidents, reports ABC News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump accused the committee of seeking his taxes under dubious circumstances, with a petition to the Supreme Court reading "The Committee's purpose in requesting President Trump's tax returns has nothing to do with funding or staffing issues at the IRS and everything to do with releasing the President's tax information to the public."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, a federal appeals court ruled that the committee would be handed the tax returns, having first sought the returns in 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC reports that Trump "recently failed to block the request on Thursday when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals shot down his request to reconsider a unanimous opinion from one of its three-judge panels approving the committee's access to the documents."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump says that the panel's attempts to get their hands on his returns are purely political.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Voter registration has been a disaster': Democrats have lost 330,000 voters in Florida</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are not poised to do well in Florida next week. In fact, it looks like they may not do well in the state for some time. Since the 2020 election, Dems have lost more than 330,000 registered voters in the state while GOP registrations have surged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Florida Division of Elections released its voter registration report for the November election, known as book closing, earlier this month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken with the reports from the general elections in 2020 and 2018, Republicans and no-party-affiliate voters show a steady increase in voter registration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from 2020 to 2022, Democrats lost 331,810 voters&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News 6 political analyst and UCF professor Dr. Jim Clark says the problem can be laid at the feet of the Florida Democratic Party.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of this large shift in registrations is that the GOP now has a registration advantage in the state for the first time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of last month, there were 5.3 million registered Republicans and just under 5 million Democrats in Florida, marking the first time in state history that the GOP will carry a voter advantage on Election Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As bad as that news is, what&rsquo;s even worse is who Democrats are losing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have picked up where Trump left off. More than half of their gains in registered voters can be attributed to the 58,000 new Hispanic voters who checked &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; on their forms. Democrats, though, are bleeding support from these communities. The party saw a net loss of more than 46,000 Hispanic voters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reversal is made more stunning because Democrats entered the election cycle firmly aware of the trend and set out to address it, promising they would have dedicated staff and outreach focused on the disparate Hispanic communities that are scattered across the state&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also worth noting that Republicans saw a slight but sizable uptick of Black registered voters in the past two years while Democrats lost more than 71,000, a quarter of which came from Miami-Dade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of all of this is that Republicans are in a position to win in Miami-Dade County for the first time in 20 years. The party has picked up 11,000 new voters in the county since 2020 while Democrats have lost nearly 58,000 voters over the same time span.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of the registration advantage, the GOP also has a big money advantage. CNN notes that in 2020 Michael Bloomberg committed $100 million to help Biden win Florida. This year there are no outside benefactors coming to rescue the Democrats. Meanwhile, Gov. DeSantis has raised nearly $200 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&rsquo; (R) political operation reported raising $177.4 million through Sept. 9, breaking the gubernatorial fundraising record without adjusting for inflation, a new OpenSecrets analysis of state campaign finance filings found. His reelection campaign has raised over $31.4 million since January 2021, and Friends of Ron DeSantis, his state-level PAC that is not subject to contribution limits, raked in $146 million since January 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that even the Miami Herald doesn&rsquo;t see much hope for Democrats this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/republicans%20predicted-huge-house-win-forecast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/republicans%20predicted-huge-house-win-forecast</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Majority rules: Republicans predicted to have huge House win in new forecast</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Party is set to experience a big win in the House of Representatives come election night, gaining a double-digit edge in the lower chamber of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP needs to have a net gain of at least five seats in the House if it wishes to take the majority, but predictions released on Tuesday indicate that the party may have a 19-seat majority after election night, bringing its total to 236 seats. This estimate is based on if Republican candidates win half of the toss-up races that are in a dead heat, according to Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority by the GOP could be bigger or smaller, depending on voter outcome for the party. In a best-case scenario for Republicans, the party would leave election night with 249 seats, while a best-case scenario for the Democratic Party would be for Republicans to have only 223 seats after the election, according to the outlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Party's lead in the 2022 midterm House elections can possibly be attributed to its focus on inflation and crime, while Democrats have focused on abortion rights following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade earlier this year. An ABC/Ipsos poll conducted from Oct. 28-29 found that 26% of those surveyed ranked the economy as the most important issue, while 23% reported inflation was the most important. The poll surveyed 729 adults and had a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Republicans are expected to take control of the House, the Senate remains up in the air, as the party only won in 50 of the 100 simulated outcomes of the midterm elections for the Senate, according to FiveThirtyEight. The GOP needs to have a net gain of at least one senator if it wishes to take control of the upper chamber of Congress.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Army begins electrification push, C5ISR office aims to smooth bumps in the road</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Army seeks to be more energy efficient between fiscal 2023 and 2027, officials with the service&rsquo;s C5ISR Center told Breaking Defense they&rsquo;re working on a plan to make the transition, whether its to installation microgrids or the planned electrified vehicle fleet, smoother and smarter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Army&rsquo;s ambitious climate strategy, which it estimates will cost upwards of $6.8 billion over five years, follows three lines of efforts: installations, acquisition and logistics and training.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the strategy&rsquo;s implementation plan, released Oct. 5, $5.2 billion of that will go to the installation line of effort, wherein the service wants to field fully electric non-tactical vehicles and reduce greenhouse gasses. The Army also wants to operationalize 55 microgrids on its installations (20 microgrids by fiscal 2024, 15 more by FY26 and then 20 more in FY27) with a total cost of $1.6 billion. (The training portion is expected to cost far less.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service is currently working on implementing the first set of those tactical microgrids, which will allow the service to &ldquo;interconnect&rdquo; power equipment in an &ldquo;interoperable and smart way,&rdquo; Marnie Bailey, power division chief at the Army&rsquo;s C5ISR Center, told Breaking Defense in an interview this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the development of the tactical microgrid standard (TMS) has underpinned a lot of the research the Army has been doing in that area. TMS is an interoperability standard that allows devices to plug and play together, and that&rsquo;s what the Army wants to do with its power systems, Mike Gonzalez, expeditionary power and environmental controls branch chief at the C5ISR Center, added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next year, the Army wants to explore how to do active load management (things that consume power, like electronics) through the use of the TMS, which can monitor the loads and see how much power installations or bases are consuming on a regular basis, whether the facilities are stateside or in far-flung regions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Army&rsquo;s climate plan, the service plans to field an all-electric light-duty-non-tactical vehicle fleet by 2027 and is aiming for an all-electric non-tactical fleet overall by 2035.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Army wants to reap the benefits of the technologies and, at the same time, make sure the transition to these new concepts are seamless for soldiers. As part of that, the service is engaging in &ldquo;soldier touchpoints&rdquo; to get feedback on what is and isn&rsquo;t working. Those soldier touchpoints are key to making sure the Army doesn&rsquo;t spend years on stuff that&rsquo;s not performing in real situations, Gonzalez said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to how the Army sees in the opportunities space over the next fiscal years coming up, both Bailey and Gonzalez summed it up in three words: intentionality, flexibility and maximizing options. It also opens up opportunities for incorporating things like artificial intelligence in the future for things like controls, Bailey added, but the focus right now remains on implementing the interoperability standards into equipment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government Is Set To Spend More On Debt Payments Than The Entire Defense Budget</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest on federal debt is set to skyrocket, potentially surpassing defense spending by as early as 2025, CNN reported Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government made $475 billion in net interest payments in the fiscal year 2022 &mdash; which ended in September&nbsp; &mdash; up from $352 in fiscal year 2021, according to the Treasury Department. The number exceeds the $406 billion spent on transportation and veterans&rsquo; benefits, and is on track to eclipse the roughly $750 billion spent on defense this year between 2025 to 2026, according to CNN, citing financial analytics firm Moody&rsquo;s Analytics. (&lsquo;Reckless&rsquo;: Obama Economist Tears Apart Biden&rsquo;s Student Loan Forgiveness)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Regardless of who wins the midterms or in 2024, there are really difficult decisions that will have to be made,&rdquo; Dan White, an economist at Moody&rsquo;s Analytics, told CNN. &ldquo;This is really going to handcuff them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve has historically kept interest rates low in a bid to encourage economic growth and the purchase of U.S. debt by foreign investors, CNN reported. This contributed to aggressive borrowing campaigns by both the Trump and Biden administrations, which boosted the nation&rsquo;s debt past $31 trillion for the first time this year, that have &ldquo;fast-forwarded us almost an entire generation&rdquo; in terms of debt, White said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With inflation still above 8%, far above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s goal of 2%, it is unlikely that the Fed will slow its pace of interest rate hikes this week in a bid to put downward pressure on the economy and slow inflation, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. As interest rate hikes push economic activity down and the cost of interest up, the U.S. might soon be in a position where it struggles to make its interest payments, White told CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recession, which economists consider increasingly likely, would make it even more difficult to make interest rate payments, since governments typically spend more on social programs during recessions, White told CNN.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">XFL Unveils Eight Cities, Teams for 2023 Season</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, the third time&rsquo;s the charm for the XFL. The newest edition of the spring football league formally announced cities, team names and logos for its new season Monday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XFL failed to live past its first season in 2001 and the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered the 2020 season after only a few weeks, but 2023 will be a new year. The season is set to start Feb. 18, 2023, and games will be televised on ESPN, ESPN2, ABC and FX.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESPN&rsquo;s Laura Rutledge showed off the new logos, names and cities for all eight of the XFL&rsquo;s squads in the announcement video.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the eight franchises and coaches for the 2023 XFL season:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington (Texas) Renegades - Bob Stoops</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D.C. Defenders - Reggie Barlow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houston Roughnecks - Wade Phillips</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orlando Guardians - Terrell Buckley</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Antonio Brahmas - Hines Ward</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Sea Dragons - Jim Haslett</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Louis Battlehawks - Anthony Becht</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vegas Vipers - Rod Woodson</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief for Tuesday, November 1st, 2022. I hope you guys had an excellent Reformation Day, and that you parents got some sleep with any potential candy crazed kiddos, but if you didn&rsquo;t here&rsquo;s some news to keep you entertained&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/dhs-leaks-starting-in-2020-dhs-began-meeting-with-twitter-facebook-wikipedia-and-more-monthly-to-coordinate-content-moderation-efforts?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/dhs-leaks-starting-in-2020-dhs-began-meeting-with-twitter-facebook-wikipedia-and-more-monthly-to-coordinate-content-moderation-efforts?utm_campaign=64487</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS LEAKS: Starting in 2020, DHS began meeting with Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia and more monthly to coordinate 'content moderation' efforts</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Homeland Security has been working to influence big tech platforms. This became originally evident when the Biden administration launched the ill-fated Disinformation Governance Board early in 2022, but has been a focus of their efforts even beyond that now-defunct unit, and before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit that revealed via appended meeting minutes that former Microsoft executive Matt Masterson, who was formerly an official with DHS, told a DHS director in February 2022 that "Platforms have got to get comfortable with gov't. It's really interesteding how hesitant they remain." This according to The Intercept.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, it was reported that DHS met with Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, and other platforms in order to coordinate "content moderation" operations. These meetings were part of an ongoing initiative which saw collusion and collaboration between DHS and big tech to determine how "misinformation" would be dealt with on those platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas that came under this purview included the withdrawal from Afghanistan, undertaken disastrously by President Joe Biden in August 2021 as well as the origins of the Covid-19 virus, which became controversial enough that users were kicked off social media platforms for expressing the hypothesis that the virus originated in a Wuhan, China lab. A Senate report found last week that this was the most likely scenario. Information that could undermine trust in financial institutions was also targeted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act, signed by President Donald Trump, opened the door to this as it formed a new branch within DHS, which then undertook to deal with online "disinformation." CISA stated its understanding that the mission of that branch of DHS was "evolved," and meant to communicate their concerns on "disinformation" to social media companies. Social media companies took DHS' word for it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS used concerns about "marginialized communities" to justify their reach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of this effort became evidence as a result of an attempt to "fight disinformation" in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. Both Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey spoke about their platform's effort to suppress and censor reporting from the New York Post. They did this, in part, because the FBI had told these platforms to watch out for a "misinformation" dump.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the elction, there were "weekly teleconference to coordinate Intelligence Community activities to counter election-related disinformation." Since then, meetings have taken place every two weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Hunter Biden laptop story broke, revealing the Biden family's influence peddling and shady overseas business dealings with Ukraine and China, social media platforms took the bait from the government and ditched the story. Countless other mainstream media outlets followed suit, going so far as to report on why they would not report on the story, citing "hacking," "misinformation," and a "Russian plot."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these were incorrect, and many outlets, including The New York Times, had to walk it back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of documents revealed in Schmitt's suit, it is now apparent that DHS officials were in fact "leading the push to expand the government's reach into disinformation," and that the government "also played a quiet role in shaping the decisions of social media giants around the New York Post story." Post-election polling showed that many Americans would not have voted for Joe Biden had they known the Hunter Biden laptop story was fact and not a disinformation plot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case that revealed the information was brought this spring by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry against top administration officials in US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It alleged that President Joe Biden and other administration officials "pressured and colluded" with Big Tech companies to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story as well as information regarding the lab leak origin theory of COVID-19 and the security of voting by mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit named White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Chief Medical Advisor and NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and newly announced director of the DHS&rsquo;s Disinformation Governance Board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also named were the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that the federal government had violated constitutional rights to suppress free speech in "one of its greatest assaults by federal government officials in the Nation&rsquo;s history."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/paul-pelosi-attacker-told-investigators-he-planned-break-house-speakers-kneecaps-affidavit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/paul-pelosi-attacker-told-investigators-he-planned-break-house-speakers-kneecaps-affidavit</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pelosi attacker told investigators he planned to break House Speaker's 'kneecaps': affidavit</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David DePape, the 42-year-old illegal immigrant from Canada accused of breaking into the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week and attacking her husband with a hammer, allegedly wanted to hold the congresswoman hostage and threatened to break "her kneecaps" if he caught her lying, according to court documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco police arrived at the home and encountered Paul Pelosi, 82, and DePape struggling over a hammer. After the officers ordered them to drop the weapon, DePape allegedly seized control of it and swung it into Pelosi&rsquo;s skull.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police recovered zip ties in Pelosi&rsquo;s bedroom, found glass broken at the rear of the house, tape, rope, gloves and a journal, according to the FBI affidavit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Pelosi was taken to a hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery on a fractured skull, he told police from the ambulance that he had never seen DePape before and that the intruder showed up in his bedroom around 2:30 a.m. demanding to talk to "Nancy" &ndash; the House Speaker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawmaker&rsquo;s husband told DePape that his wife was out, and DePape allegedly decided to wait for her to return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Pelosi stated that his wife would not be home for several days, and then DePape reiterated that he would wait," according to the affidavit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"DePape stated that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her," the affidavit reads. "If Nancy were to tell DePape the &lsquo;truth,&rsquo; he would let her go, and if she &lsquo;lied,&rsquo; he was going to break &lsquo;her kneecaps.&rsquo;"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"DePape also later explained that by breaking Nancy&rsquo;s kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into Congress, which would show other Members of Congress that there were consequences to actions," the affidavit continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape also allegedly admitted to breaking into the home, using the hammer to shatter a glass door and surprising Paul Pelosi in his bedroom. He also allegedly confessed to cracking the 82-year-old's skull.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Immigrations and Customers Enforcement source told Fox News Monday that DePape is in the U.S. illegally after a "longtime" visa overstay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was born in Canada and emigrated to the U.S. about 20 years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape now faces federal charges and up to 50 years in prison according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/thegrio-kff-survey-black-voters-17-percent-support-defunding-police"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/thegrio-kff-survey-black-voters-17-percent-support-defunding-police</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 17% of black voters support defunding the police: Poll</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 17% of black voters say they support defunding the police, a poll released this week found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Survey of Black Voters, conducted by TheGrio and KFF and published on Wednesday, asked 1,000 black adults who say they are registered to vote for their opinion on policing. About half of those polled, 48%, said they would like to see police funding kept about the same, while 34% said they wanted increased financial support. Just 17% responded that they support decreased funding for police in their area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of black voters living in urban areas, 39% supported increased funding. That's a 10-point jump from the 29% of black voters living in suburban areas who said they back increased funds for police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll also found that 3 in 4 black voters viewed criminal justice and policing as a "very important factor in making their decision about who to vote for," including 77% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans. The issue of crime was as important for those who made under $40,000 per year as it was for those making over $90,000 annually.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The "defund the police" effort emerged through Black Lives Matter protests, which began in the early 2010s. The idea was initially dismissed as fringe but grew in prominence during the summer of 2020, when the murder of George Floyd sparked racial justice protests across the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notable progressives such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Cori Bush (D-MO), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) became ardent supporters of the defund movement. Other prominent Democrats, such as current Democratic candidates Stacey Abrams and John Fetterman, discussed reallocating funds to social services and investing in minority communities, as well as ideas for reimagining policing, in interviews. Clips from those conversations have been used by Republicans in ads against their candidacies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all Democrats got on board with the defund movement, though. Both President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) made frequent note of their support for increased police funding during the 2020 election cycle and hold the same positions now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/30/kyrie-irving-doubles-down-on-controversial-book-tweet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/10/30/kyrie-irving-doubles-down-on-controversial-book-tweet/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyrie Irving doubles down on controversial tweet: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand down&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a testy exchange with the media Saturday night, Kyrie Irving doubled down and dug in, defending not only his recent social media posts promoting a movie largely viewed as anti-Semitic, but also older ones amplifying conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving&rsquo;s posts from late this past week drew a statement from the NBA and a public rebuke from Nets owner Joe Tsai. Neither the league nor the team, however, convinced Irving to take down his initial post or back down in the slightest. And after the Nets&rsquo; latest loss, a 125-116 drubbing by the Pacers at Barclays Center, he vowed not to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_NkmhJkWA_8"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Kyrie Irving addresses backlash to his recent social media posts&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/_NkmhJkWA_8&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Kyrie Irving addresses backlash to his recent social media posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man&hellip; Things got a little testy&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving does indeed have a huge fan base, with 17.5 million followers on Instagram and another 4.5 million on Twitter. And on Thursday he took to both platforms to promote a 2018 movie called &ldquo;Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America.&rdquo; Both the film and the 2014 book it is based on are filled with anti-Semitic disinformation, including accusations of large numbers of Jewish people worshipping Satan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving has since been rebuked by the NBA Player&rsquo;s Association.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>When faced with a difficult task&mdash;like restoring the Western Legal Tradition&mdash;convictions based on truth are essential. But what will inspire the courage necessary to the task: truth alone or truth that is beautiful. If the latter, what can be said that makes law beautiful to anyone?</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief for Friday, October 28th, 2022. I&rsquo;m on my way to Boise to see my mom as we speak, but first, I figured I should get you the news heading into the weekend!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/facebook-fined-25m-for-breaking-washington-state-election-law?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/facebook-fined-25m-for-breaking-washington-state-election-law?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook fined $25M for breaking Washington state election law</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook&rsquo;s parent company Meta was issued a $25 million fine Wednesday for violating Washington state's campaign finance laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court documents, King County Superior Court Judge Douglass North found Meta to be in violation of Washington&rsquo;s political disclosure law 822 separate times between 2019 and 2021 and issued the maximum possible fine for each instance, which totaled up to $30,000 per violation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta was also ordered to "come into full compliance" with the state's election transparency laws within the next 30 days as well as pay the attorney's fees for the case, which Ferguson has requested be tripled for a total of $10.5 million. The final total will be decided by North at a later date.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Seattle Times, the state&rsquo;s election transparency laws, which have been in place since 1972, require ad sellers to "disclose the names and addresses of political buys, the targets of such ads and, the total number of viewers of each ad.&rdquo; The judge found that Meta had intentionally violated the standards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Democrat Attorney General Bob Ferguson said "that he had "one word for Facebook's conduct in this case &ndash; arrogance."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Times, "It intentionally disregarded Washington's election transparency laws," Ferguson said. "But that wasn't enough. Facebook argued in court that those laws should be declared unconstitutional. That's breathtaking."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferguson originally sued Meta, then still known as Facebook, for violation of the 1972 transparency laws in 2018 for $200,000. In response the company said they would stop selling political ads in the state rather than comply with the law. Ferguson filed a second lawsuit against the company in 2020 after a report revealed that the company was still selling political ads which were out of compliance with state law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Times, the company said that the laws "unduly burden political speech" and were "virtually impossible to comply with."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a motion filed in July, Ferguson wrote that Meta had failed to respond to multiple inspection requests regarding political advertisements on its platform in Washington between 2019 and 2021 and after several complaints were filed to the state Public Disclosure Commission, the Executive Director of the agency Peter Lavallee referred the case to Ferguson in September 2021 for potential legal action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spring, Meta filed a motion asking the court to strike down the regulations for commercial advertisers which was denied by North in September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/lori-lightfoot-demands-5-pay-rise-as-chicago-crime-rates-spiral-out-of-control/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/lori-lightfoot-demands-5-pay-rise-as-chicago-crime-rates-spiral-out-of-control/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori Lightfoot Demands 5% Pay rise as Chicago Crime Rates Spiral Out of Control</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot proposed giving herself a 5 percent annual pay increase despite mounting criticisms of soaring violent crime in her city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightfoot currently takes home an annual salary of $209,915, but the Mayor now demands an increase of up to 5 percent each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ordinance announced on Wednesday it would give Lightfoot, city clerk, and treasurer access to a pay increase each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This would mirror the process used by aldermen who are already eligible for the pay rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;To be clear, the ordinance that was introduced today would put the Mayor, the city treasurer, and the clerk in line with all the other elected officials regarding a cost of living increase,&rdquo; Mayor Lightfoot said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pay increase comes as violent crime in Chicago have increased by 37 percent since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shootings in the city are up from the previous weekend when nine murders and 31 victims were reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been a total of 2,313 shooting incidents reported in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last weekend, a total of 51 people were shot in Chicago, with some 11 victims dying in the 43 separate incidents &ndash; nine of the victims being juveniles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, 49,433 more crimes were reported in Chicago than 35,746 in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori Lightfoot vowed to tackle the city&rsquo;s crime rates after she was sworn into office in May 2019, but up to now, she has failed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chicago mayor also made a massive U-turn on her proposal to cut $59million from the Chicago Police Department&rsquo;s budget amid the defund the police&rsquo; protests in the summer of 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Lori Lightfoot denouncing the &lsquo;defund the police&rsquo; movement, Chicago&rsquo;s police union has since issued a vote of &lsquo;no confidence in the Mayor.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia Advances Bill Banning 'Gay Propaganda' and Content Promoting Transgenderism to Children</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the lower house of Russia&rsquo;s parliament, the Duma, voted to approve amendments to the country&rsquo;s 2013 legislation banning "gay propaganda."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These amendments will expand the 2013 law, which banned the dissemination of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations" to children, expanding it to include those 18 and older, according to the Associated Press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers in the Duma voted unanimously to approve the amendments, but still faces the upper house of Russia&rsquo;s parliament, the Federation Council, before it can be signed into law by Russian President Vladimir Putin, France 24 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New provisions in the amendment set out to ban "gay propaganda" for all Russians, not just minors, in advertisements, the internet, media, literature, and cinema. Also set to be banned is "propaganda of pedophilia."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendments would also look to ban the "denial of family values," and seeks to stop propaganda that could "cause minors to desire to change their sex."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreigners found in violation of the law could face expulsion.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/business/joseph-vazquez/2022/10/27/soros-gave-176m-lefty-group-pushing-facebook-tiktok-censor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://newsbusters.org/blogs/business/joseph-vazquez/2022/10/27/soros-gave-176m-lefty-group-pushing-facebook-tiktok-censor</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soros Gave $17.6M to Lefty Group Pushing Facebook, TikTok to Censor So-Called Election Disinfo</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another group heavily financed by liberal billionaire George Soros is joining a growing network of organizations he funds calling on Big Tech to do more to censor so-called election &ldquo;disinformation&rdquo; before the midterms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leftist group Global Witness released a co-authored piece of propaganda disguised as an &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; with New York University&rsquo;s Cyber Security for Democracy team (C4D) whining that Facebook and TikTok weren&rsquo;t censoring enough.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group&rsquo;s Oct. 21 press release on its report, headlined &ldquo;Facebook and TikTok fail to block deceptive ads with blatant US midterms disinformation,&rdquo; claimed its &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; was engineered to &ldquo;determine how well social media platforms are living up to their promises to stop disinformation that can destabilise democratic processes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soros&rsquo; Open Society Foundations gave Global Witness $17,657,000 between 2016 and 2020 alone. The group has offices in London, Brussels and Washington D.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group complained that TikTok &ldquo;approved 90 percent of ads featuring misleading and false election disinformation&rdquo; while Facebook allegedly &ldquo;approved a significant number of similarly inaccurate and false ads.&rdquo; Global Witness Senior Advisor John Lloyd tried to drum up fear about a supposed threat to &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; if Big Tech companies didn&rsquo;t up the ante on their censorship operations:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is high time they got their houses in order and started properly resourcing the detection and prevention of disinformation, before it&rsquo;s too late. Our democracy rests on their willingness to act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple media outlets like The New York Times and The Hill gobbled up and regurgitated Global Witness&rsquo; talking points without mentioning the group&rsquo;s financial ties to Soros:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times: &ldquo;TikTok failed to stop most misleading political ads in a test run by researchers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hill: &ldquo;TikTok, Facebook failed to remove ads spreading election misinformation: report.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune: &ldquo;TikTok let through 90% of ads spreading baseless claims around U.S. midterms, new report finds.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press: &ldquo;Report: TikTok bad at culling US election misinformation ads.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian: &ldquo;&lsquo;We risk another crisis&rsquo;: TikTok in danger of being major vector of election misinformation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Witness, however, praised YouTube for its obsession with censoring election content while still finding room to suggest it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough in censoring election content in Brazil. Could that be because Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is an ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump? Bolsonaro is currently in the middle of a highly contested election against leftist and disgraced former Brazilian President Luiz In&aacute;cio &ldquo;Lula&rdquo; Da Silva.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now&hellip; it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve got requests from my coworkers on this one: Our behind the scenes all-stars here at CrossPolitic Anna Hadfield, and Neil Alcomendras. By the way ladies he&rsquo;s still single&hellip; I&rsquo;ll go ahead and start with Neil&rsquo;s request&hellip; and that is Anderson Silva will be fighting Jake Paul in the ring this weekend&hellip; For those that don&rsquo;t know, Anderson Silva is one of the more decorated fighters in mixed martial arts. He is a former UFC Middleweight Champion and holds the record for the longest title reign in UFC history at 2,457 days. This started in 2006 and ended in 2013 and included a UFC record 16 consecutive victories in that span. Now a lot of people think Jake Paul is a joke, but my friend Neil, who knows a thing or two about fighting, says Paul is actually a solid boxer, and an athlete&hellip; but&hellip; the fight may reportedly be in jeopardy&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.badlefthook.com/2022/10/27/23426896/paul-vs-silva-arizona-commission-meet-regarding-anderson-eligibility-fight-boxing-news-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.badlefthook.com/2022/10/27/23426896/paul-vs-silva-arizona-commission-meet-regarding-anderson-eligibility-fight-boxing-news-2022</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake Paul&rsquo;s fight with Anderson Silva on Saturday is in at least potential jeopardy, as the Arizona Boxing &amp; MMA Commission will meet this evening about the event, following remarks recently made by Silva that he&rsquo;d been knocked out twice during training camp.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 47-year-old Silva said in an interview that was released this week &mdash; but reportedly actually took place a month ago &mdash; that he&rsquo;d been knocked out twice in sparring leading up to the fight, and the Arizona commission told ESPN&rsquo;s Marc Raimondi that they will &ldquo;review additional documentation submitted&rdquo; by Silva</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva has said he &ldquo;misspoke&rdquo; in the interview, noting that English is not his first language, and also that he was joking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a misspoken joke could threaten what is a major money event for himself, Paul, and Showtime Sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most likely outcome, just at a wager, is that the fight will go on unless Silva &mdash; or Paul, for that matter &mdash; failed a medical examination from the commission. It would seem pretty hard to prove that he wasn&rsquo;t simply joking or that he didn&rsquo;t just use the wrong words. But it&rsquo;s a situation where the commission have to at least review the issue officially, too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the fight does happen &mdash; and we&rsquo;ll know by tonight if it&rsquo;s going ahead or not, with the official weigh-in set for tomorrow morning &mdash; then the fight is on!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, time for the other item. Anna&rsquo;s family, and little brother&rsquo;s specifically, are big time Eagle&rsquo;s fans, and the Philadelphia Eagles are doing incredibly well this year. They&rsquo;re undefeated at the moment, with a perfect 6-0 record. They also just traded for a talented, and veteran defensive lineman in Robert Quinn. According to The MMQB's Albert Breer, the Bears are picking up $7.1 million of Quinn's remaining salary for this season. In turn, the Eagles will pay Quinn a shade over $700,000 for the duration of the campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quinn, 32, has had a quiet season for the Bears, posting one sack, three quarterback hits and eight tackles in seven games. It's a far cry from his 2021 season when he notched 18.5 sacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dating back to 2018, however, Quinn has rotated mediocre sack totals with big seasons:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018: 6.5 sacks in 16 games</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019: 11.5 sacks in 14 games</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020: Two sacks in 15 games</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021: 18.5 sacks in 16 games</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depth on the edge became a major need for the Eagles after Derek Barnett was lost for the season with a torn ACL in September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But folks it gets better&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next four quarterbacks the Eagles are scheduled to face have 12 career wins.T</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have 49 touchdowns and 41 interceptions, lifetime passer ratings ranging from 66.7 to 87.0 three wins this year and three career wins over winning teams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Steelers, Texans, Commanders and Colts continue with their current starting quarterbacks, the undefeated Eagles over the next four weeks will face rookie Kenny Pickett, who&rsquo;s thrown two TDs and seven INTs in his first three career starts; Davis Mills, who&rsquo;s won three of 17 career starts; Taylor Heinicke, who&rsquo;s played for three fewer NFL teams (five) than career wins (eight); and Sam Ehlinger, a 6th-round pick who&rsquo;s never thrown an NFL pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, yes, the Eagles appear to be wins over Pickett, Mills, Heinicke and Ehlinger away from a 10-0 record. This coming off a win over Cooper Rush in his sixth career start.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those quarterbacks will be facing a pass defense that through seven weeks is No. 1 in the NFL opposing passer rating and yards allowed and No. 2 in completion percentage and sacks.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Part Two. When it comes to Bible prophecy, we are often playing on a chessboard that&rsquo;s been set up by a group of competitors and with pieces that can move only in terms of their rules. This means that before there can be a discussion of any type of millennialism, there must be an evaluation of passages that seemingly discount each one. The prophetic board must be swept clean before any of the so-called millennial positions can be discussed.</p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/hundreds-of-employees-leave-twitter-for-jobs-with-meta-google-as-musk-deal-approaches?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/hundreds-of-employees-leave-twitter-for-jobs-with-meta-google-as-musk-deal-approaches?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of employees leave Twitter for jobs with Meta, Google as Musk deal approaches</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter employees are leaving at rates not seen before as a result of Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk's takeover, Business Insider reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several hundred employees have left the media giant in 2022, with 530 leaving in the last three months. Many have left to competitors such as Meta and Google, the outlet reports</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may not be bad news for Musk, however, as the multibillionaire reportedly has intentions of cutting staff by up to 75 percent, according to a report. Musk is set to close the deal on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk offered to buy Twitter in April but then sought to end the acquisition a few months later, which resulted in a legal battle between him and the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Musk announced he would go through with the original offer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Delaware Court of Chancery has given Musk until Oct. 28 to close the deal, otherwise, the matter will go to trial in November.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Fox News, on Tesla&rsquo;s earnings call last week, Musk said he was "excited about the Twitter situation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-mortgage-interest-rates-jump-716-highest-since-2001-2022-10-26/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-mortgage-interest-rates-jump-716-highest-since-2001-2022-10-26/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. mortgage interest rates jump to 7.16%, highest since 2001</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan rose to its highest level since 2001 as tightening financial conditions weigh on the housing sector, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) showed on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose by 22 basis points to 7.16% for the week ended Oct. 21 while the MBA's Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, fell 1.7% from a week earlier. Mortgage application activity is at its slowest pace since 1997.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage rates have more than doubled since the beginning of the year, as the Federal Reserve pursues an aggressive path of interest rate hikes to rein in stubbornly high inflation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank is expected to raise rates by 75 basis points for a fourth straight time at the conclusion of its next policy meeting on Nov. 1-2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those actions, designed to cool the economy sufficiently to curb price pressures, have weighed heavily on the interest-rate-sensitive housing sector as expectations for Fed tightening have led to a surge in Treasury yields.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The yield on the 10-year note acts as a benchmark for mortgage rates.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warns-most-covid-related-deaths-this-year-result-people-not-being-updated-their-vaccines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warns-most-covid-related-deaths-this-year-result-people-not-being-updated-their-vaccines</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden warns most COVID-related deaths this year will be result of people not being updated on their vaccines</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden on Tuesday warned the American people that nearly every COVID-related death this year will be because people have not received the updated vaccine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also called on Congress to provide the billions of dollars the administration has requested to buy additional vaccines, tests and treatments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president&rsquo;s comments come ahead of the holiday season when the weather is colder and more people are spending time indoors and contagious viruses are more likely to spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden pointed to new variants in the U.S. and a rise in hospitalizations in Europe and urged people to get the latest vaccine and the flu shot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this year found that more than 75% of COVID-19 deaths in fully vaccinated people had occurred among those with at least four comorbidities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden twice tested positive for COVID-19 in July, despite being fully vaccinated and twice boosted. His physician said the president&rsquo;s rare "rebound" positivity followed treatment with PAXLOVID.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the press conference, Biden rolled up his sleeve and got his updated COVID-19 booster shot from a member of the White House medical unit. He had to delay getting his booster, in accordance with federal health guidance, because of his infection over the summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 20 million people, including nearly 1 in 5 older adults, have gotten the updated COVID-19 booster, the White House said. The vaccine has been reformulated to target the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of omicron, the most dominant strains in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-darrell-brooks-found-guilty-of-intentional-homicide?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-darrell-brooks-found-guilty-of-intentional-homicide?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darrell Brooks found guilty of intentional homicide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday morning, the jury found Darrell Brooks guilty of six counts of intentional homicide, 61 counts of reckless endangerment, six counts of hit and run, two counts of bail jumping, and one count of battery in connection to the Waukesha Christmas parade last year, where Brooks drove his SUV through the crowd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks was found guilty of all charges. A hearing regarding sentencing will begin on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While waiting for the jury to be brought out, Brooks once again stated that he "does not consent" to be called his legal name, and brought up "subject matter jurisdiction," stating that it has not been addressed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks continued on to list of a number of requests, which Dorow acknowledged, but denied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the nearly month-long trial, Brooks has argued with Dorow on a multitude of points, causing interruptions which in many cases resulted in Brooks being moved to a neighboring courtroom to listen in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 21, 2021, Brooks drove through the Waukesha Christmas parade, killing six people, including members of the Dancing Grannies group which were marching in the parade, as well as children. More than 60 people were injured in the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks was soon after identified as the suspect in the parade attack, after police discovered the red Ford Explorer seen plowing into the parade parked not far from the scene of the crime with damage to the front end of the vehicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the Reddit post, Brooks has attempted to have the charges against him thrown out because of a reported recall on his model year of vehicle regarding the throttle body. Brooks said that a class action lawsuit has been filed alleging that the vehicle can speed up without warning due to a malfunction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks brought up this point during the last days of his trial, with Dorow dismissing Brook&rsquo;s requests, stating, "I've made my decision. I expect that you respect the decision at least as we are not going to debate it further."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks has also attempted to state that he is a "sovereign citizen," therefore not subject to the jurisdiction of the government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dorow called Brooks&rsquo; declaration of being a sovereign citizen an "obstructionist tactic."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So again, Brooks was found guilty of all charges. A hearing regarding sentencing will begin on Monday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police in Hialeah, Florida, have arrested a second suspect for an alleged assault on a canvasser for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., that took place Sunday night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an arrest affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital, Jonathan Alexander Casanova joined Javier Lopez in attacking the canvasser. The document also noted that the canvasser told police that Casanova told him he could not pass through the area because he was a Republican.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"After tirelessly working to bring justice to the victim, Hialeah Police Detectives have arrested and charged Jonathan Alexander Casanova for the attack which occurred on Sunday, October 23, 2022," Sgt. Jose Torres said in a statement to Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrest affidavit says that the victim &ndash; who has since been identified by local media as Chris Monzon &ndash; was walking in the neighborhood handing out fliers for Rubio and Gov. Ron DeSantis when Casanova and Lopez were blocking the sidewalk. Following an argument, the affidavit says, Lopez "rushed the victim and threw him on the ground," and then Casanova "began to kick the victim on the head as he was on the ground." While Casanova kicked him, Lopez punched Monzon in the head, police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The affidavit says a witness then pulled Casanova off of Monzon, and then Casanova released two German shepherds from his car and walked with them over to Monzon, who was on the ground, and "began to give commands to the dogs to attack and bite" him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police document says neighbors eventually separated everyone involved, but Casanova fled before officers arrived at the scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The affidavit says that Lopez identified Casanova to police and that Monzon later identified Casanova via a photo line-up. Monzon also provided a sworn statement on video, which is when he said Casanova told him he could not pass because he is a Republican and threatened to have his dogs attack him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monzon said in the statement that he tried to walk around Casanova and Lopez but that Casanova then told him he was not allowed to walk around the neighborhood and threatened to shoot him if he continued. Monzon then said he was on public property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubio's tweet also said that the alleged attackers said Republicans were not allowed in their neighborhood. Initially, police said they had not determined if the attack was politically motivated, and Lopez's arrest affidavit did not mention any remarks about political parties.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guys, I don&rsquo;t really have much in sports for you today&hellip; maybe who do you guys have in the world series this year?

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On today&rsquo;s &lsquo;live&rsquo; episode Tom unpacks insights from John Rist's book: <em>What is a Person?</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>After noting the rich conception of the human person which arose out of classical realist and Christian theological sources, which supplied a robust view of the unique gift and dignity of each human made in the image of God, called by the Gospel to eternal communion with God, Rist then notes the rise of philosophical and political elites who rejected the transcendent vision of Christianity, and embraced philosophies which undercut the personhood of human beings, to the point that apart from themselves, elites began to promote visions which saw the bulk of human beings as inferiors and dependent on their lies for their own safety and survival. Glenn and Chris bring into the discussion many fascinating insights, and all three recognize the elitist agenda continues today, often out in the open.</p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-new-york-city-ordered-by-court-to-reinstate-all-those-fired-over-covid-vaccine-mandates?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-new-york-city-ordered-by-court-to-reinstate-all-those-fired-over-covid-vaccine-mandates?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City ordered by court to reinstate all those fired over Covid vaccine mandates</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the New York Supreme Court ruled that New York City must reinstate all employees that were fired because of their vaccination status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order also states that for those fired, backpay must be issued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit was filed against the City of New York, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the New York Department of Sanitation, Commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene David Chokshi, and New York City Mayor Eric Adams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Though vaccination should be encouraged, public employees should not have been terminated for their noncompliance," the court stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Based upon the Petitioners&rsquo; vague denials of their exemptions, the fact they were kept at full duty for several months while their exemptions were pending, the Mayor&rsquo;s Executive Order granting exemptions to certain classes of people, and the lifting of the private sector mandate, this Court finds the Commissioners Orders of October 20, 2021, and December 13, 2021, as well as the Mayor&rsquo;s Executive Order No. 62 to be arbitrary and capricious," the court ruled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petitioners of the suit are former Department of Sanitation employees that were terminated from their positions in February 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petitioners argued that Adam&rsquo;s Executive Order No. 62, which provided exemptions for athletes, performers, and other artists, "rendered the public employee vaccination mandate arbitrary and capricious or unconstitutional."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court noted that all but one of the petitioners applied for exemptions, and questioned why the city could not keep its vaccine or test policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court did not argue against issuing temporary vaccination mandates in a public health emergency, but added, "however, ordering and enforcing that vaccination policy on only a portion of the populace for an indefinite period of time, is akin to legislating."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court also stated, "being vaccinated does not prevent an individual from contracting or transmitting Covid-19. As of the day of this Decision, CDC guidelines regarding quarantine and isolation are the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Petitioners should not have been terminated for choosing not to protect themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have learned through the course of the pandemic that the vaccine against Covid-19 is not absolute. breakthrough cases occur, even for those who have been vaccinated and boosted. President Joseph Biden has said that the pandemic is over. The State of New York ended the Covid-19 state of emergency over a month ago," the court said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary Clinton already accusing &lsquo;right-wing extremists&rsquo; of stealing 2024 election</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1583496354734538756"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1583496354734538756</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a video posted to social media accused "right-wing extremists" of having "a plan to literally steal the next presidential election."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video was posted by an organization called Indivisible which claims on its website to be "a grassroots movement of thousands of local Indivisible groups with a mission to elect progressive leaders, rebuild our democracy, and defeat the Trump agenda."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failed presidential candidate has repeatedly questioned the results of the 2016 election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Clinton said that Russian President Vladimir Putin helped to rig the 2016 election against her in an interview on MSNBC. "Putin is the great disrupter. He has a clear mission to undermine democracies, first and foremost, the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost immediately after the statement, Clinton also claimed that anyone who disputed the results of the 2020 election was working for the Kremlin, either directly or indirectly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the organization's website, "Indivisible was founded in response to Trump&rsquo;s election - but we know that Trump is a symptom of a sick democracy, not its cause. We face two fundamental problems: first, our democracy was rigged from the start in favor of the white and wealthy."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups added, "in the last few decades, an alliance of white nationalists and the ultra-rich have been actively working to further undermine democracy and cement their hold on power permanently. That&rsquo;s how we ended up with Trump. We have to build a democracy that reflects a broad, multiracial &ldquo;we the people,&rdquo; one that works for all of us and is sustained by all of us. Only then will we be able to achieve a progressive vision for our future."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group has its own 501c3, 501c4, and PAC.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk May Close Twitter Deal by Friday</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk has pledged to close his $44 billion Twitter Inc. deal by Friday in a video conference call with bankers who are helping fund the deal, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banks have finished putting together the final credit agreement and are in the process of signing the documentation, according to the report, in one of the last steps in moving funds to Musk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter and Musk's lawyers were not immediately available for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk has pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covers the $44 billion price tag and closing costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp., have committed to provide $13 billion of debt financing to support the deal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity investors, including Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, will pitch in with $7.1 billion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Even Green Energy Execs Are Buying Biden&rsquo;s Offshore Wind Plan</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind energy executives are skeptical of the Biden administration&rsquo;s plan to significantly expand offshore wind power in the next several years due to rising costs and the slow permitting of offshore leases, according to the Financial Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration aims to grow U.S. offshore wind generation from less than 1 gigawatt currently to 30 gigawatts by the end of 2030 as part of its aggressive green energy transition, according to a White House fact sheet. However, wind executives are concerned that the administration&rsquo;s target is too ambitious as projects are constantly delayed by a permitting bottleneck and expensive leases, the FT reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various energy projects including offshore wind developments face difficulties in receiving correct permitting from the government, which delays construction and increases costs, according to the FT. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia proposed a permitting bill in September that could have accelerated the federal permitting of key wind, solar and fossil fuel projects; however, the measure was pulled from a recent government funding bill after it failed to gain sufficient support in the Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchin&rsquo;s bill would have also given the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) more power to expedite the permitting of transmission lines that transport electricity produced by offshore wind and other renewables to urban areas. Roughly 77 gigawatts of offshore wind are awaiting transmission, according to the Department of Energy&rsquo;s August wind energy report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executives also claim prices of federal leases for offshore wind developments are too high, which makes it difficult for wind developers to make profits, the FT reported. The federal New York Bight offshore wind auction, which offered six lease areas totaling over 488,000 acres, received $4.37 billion total in winning bids, representing the nation&rsquo;s highest-grossing competitive offshore energy lease sale in history, according to an Interior Department press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation is a further concern for wind firms and their equipment manufacturers as the cost of materials continues to rise, according to the FT.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Border Patrol Numbers Show an Alarming Number of Terrorists Entering the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New numbers released in a calculated, late Friday night news dump over the weekend show an alarming and increasing number of suspected terrorists are entering the United States through the southern border with Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the data, Border Patrol agents have encountered 98 suspected terrorists in fiscal year 2022. In 2021, that number was 15. In 2020, it was three and in 2019, zero.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Terrorist Screening Dataset (TSDS) &ndash; also known as the &ldquo;watchlist&rdquo; &ndash; is the U.S. government&rsquo;s database that contains sensitive information on terrorist identities. The TSDS originated as the consolidated terrorist watchlist to house information on known or suspected terrorists (KSTs) but has evolved over the last decade to include additional individuals who represent a potential threat to the United States, including known affiliates of watchlisted individuals," U.S. Customs and Border Protection explains.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current number only includes suspected terrorists who were caught, not the number embedded in the estimated one million illegal aliens who evaded law enforcement while entering the country and disappearing into American communities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Congressman Andy Biggs, who represents Arizona's 5th Congressional District, is sounding the alarm about the increase.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WNBA's Brittney Griner to serve 9-year term in Russian penal colony after losing appeal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Russian court upheld the nine-year prison sentence for American basketball player Brittney Griner on Tuesday for drug possession. Griner appeared via video at the Moscow Regional Court from a penal colony outside the city, where she is imprisoned and will remain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griner was convicted on August 4 after police found vape canisters containing cannabis oil at the Moscow airport where she landed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griner's appeal was rejected after a ruling on Tuesday to uphold the sentence. The ruling did state that Griner will have time served in prison with her pre-trial detention now being included in her sentence, with each day of pre-trial detention being counted as 1.5 days in prison. Griner will thus have to serve around eight years in a Russian prison, reports AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griner's arrest came as tensions were high between Russia and the United States and just days before Moscow made the call to send troops to Ukraine. Griner played basketball in a Russian women's league during the WNBA's off-season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griner said that she packed the canisters accidentally and that she was prescribed cannabis for pain. She pleaded guilty to the charge. Griner's sentence of 9 years was close to the maximum of 10, with her legal team saying that the punishment was excessive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even NBA star Steph Curry got in on the action in Brittany&rsquo;s defense:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House told reporters following her conviction that they were aggressively pursuing every avenue to bring home Griner to the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that negotiations between the Biden administration and Russia to bring Griner home remain ongoing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, there were reports that the Biden administration offered to exchange a convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for the release of Griner and Pail Whelan.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief for Tuesday, October 25th, 2022. I hope you and your family had a restful weekend, but now let&rsquo;s take a dive back into the news. Before we do that however&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Has Only 25 Days of Diesel Supply; Shortage Could Cripple Economy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States is down to 25 days of diesel supply as a top White House official declared the stockpile levels to be &ldquo;unacceptably low.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data provided by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) show that diesel stockpiles are at their lowest level for October in records that date back to 1993, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. EIA data show that the United States, as of Oct. 14, has 25.4 days of supply&mdash;down from 34.2 days of supply four weeks prior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, a top adviser to President Joe Biden, told Bloomberg News last week that current diesel levels are &ldquo;unacceptably&rdquo; low and that &ldquo;all options are on the table&rdquo; to increase supplies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diesel crunch comes just over two weeks before the November 2022 midterm elections and will likely drive up prices even more. Diesel is the fuel used by freight trains and commonly used by long-haul truckers to transport goods and food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices, meanwhile, remain relatively elevated, according to AAA data. The average price for a gallon of diesel stands at around $5.33 nationwide, or up nearly $2 since the same time in 2021, the data shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale diesel prices at the New York spot market spiked last week to more than $200 per barrel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes as the Biden administration recently announced it would release another 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, part of the 180 million Biden authorized in March, that Republicans say is a bid to keep Democrats politically afloat ahead of the midterms. But Biden and his allies say that it&rsquo;s not a political tactic, and the administration says it will refill the reserve when prices drop to $67&ndash;$72 per barrel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-on-his-fitness-for-office-i-could-drop-dead-tomorrow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-on-his-fitness-for-office-i-could-drop-dead-tomorrow</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden On His Fitness For Office: &lsquo;I Could Drop Dead Tomorrow&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden (D) responded to questions about his age and fitness for office during an interview that aired Sunday morning by saying that he could &ldquo;drop dead tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU to Gift $18 Billion to Ukraine Next Year, the Rest Will Come From U.S</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke after the 27 national EU leaders discussed supporting Ukraine during the second day of their summit in Brussels on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the EU has so far sent $19 billion to Ukraine this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Von der Leyen said the EU would finance 1.5 billion euros per month, with the rest expected to come from the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a video link, Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the EU leaders saying Russian missiles and Iranian drones have damaged a third of Ukraine&rsquo;s energy infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Von der Leyen said the EU was looking to help Ukraine re-establish water, power and electricity supplies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelensky asked the EU for air and missile defence systems and called for &ldquo;new powerful&rdquo; sanctions on Russia and Iran for supplying drones in Moscow&rsquo;s war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland and the three Baltic states proposed banning diamond imports from Russia and phasing out the steel trade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Hungary opposed sanctions against Russia, while Germany and France have said current measures already go far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelensky appealed for more aid pledges to be made at an international conference in Berlin next Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Council President Charles Michel, the summit&rsquo;s chairman, said the EU was looking at using Russian assets frozen under sanctions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that seizing assets amounted to some 300 billion euros, while Berlin and others have warned it might be illegal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kallas also sided with Lithuania for a possible international tribunal to judge possible war crimes committed in Ukraine.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ex-Minneapolis police officer Kueng pleads guilty in George Floyd killing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Minneapolis police officer pleaded guilty on Monday to aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in the May 2020 killing of George Floyd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alexander Kueng&rsquo;s guilty plea will allow one count of aiding and abetting second-degree murder to be dismissed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kueng had helped to restrain Floyd, who was handcuffed and knelt on his back during the May 25, 2020, killing that was recorded on video.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is the second officer to plead guilty to the state charge. Thomas Lane earlier pleaded guilty to the same count. Their former colleague, Tou Thao, is still scheduled to face trial this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three have already been convicted on federal counts of willfully violating the civil rights of Floyd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lane was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in the federal case. Kueng was sentenced to three years and Thao was sentenced to 3 1/2 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officer Derek Chauvin has already been convicted of state murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd&rsquo;s killing last year and is currently serving 22 1/2 years in the state case. Chauvin had pinned Floyd to the ground with a knee on Floyd&rsquo;s neck as he repeatedly said he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State sentencing guidelines for a person with no criminal record, like Kueng, call for a range from about 3 1/2 years to four years and nine months in prison for second-degree unintentional manslaughter. The presumptive sentence is four years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Kueng had been convicted of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, he would have faced a presumptive 12 1/2 years in prison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Teen Pleads Guilty in School Shooting That Killed 4 Students</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Michigan teenager on Monday pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism charges in a mass shooting at a high school last year that killed four of his classmates and wounded more than half a dozen other people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethan Crumbley, 16, is accused of opening fire at Oxford High School outside Detroit on Nov. 30 with a handgun that his father purchased for him as a Christmas gift days before the massacre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two boys, aged 17 and 16, and two girls, aged 17 and 14, were killed while six other students and a teacher were wounded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley, who was a 15-year-old at the time of the shooting, pleaded guilty in Oakland County Circuit Court to a total of 24 charges, including one count of terrorism causing death and four counts of first-degree murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also charged with seven counts of assault with intent to murder and 12 counts of possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He faces life without parole when he is sentenced. A tentative sentencing hearing is scheduled for Feb. 9, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley&rsquo;s lawyers on Monday withdrew an insanity defense notice that they had previously filed with the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley&rsquo;s parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, also face involuntary manslaughter charges connected to the shooting. In that case, Rochester District Court Judge Julie Nicholson said evidence showed they had purchased a gun for their son despite signs that he was a &ldquo;troubled young man.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case appears to be the first in the United States in which the parents of a teenage school shooter have been charged with crimes attributed to their child. They have pleaded not guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four days before the shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneil Dariush drops Mateusz Gamrot late, secures unanimous decision victory</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneil Dariush continued his winning ways at UFC 280 while vanquishing Mateusz Gamrot, who had quickly become one of the most talked about lightweights in the promotion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showcasing incredible takedown defense combined with a punishing style on the feet, Dariush never slowed down over all rounds as he continued to hammer Gamrot with strikes. Late in the third round, Dariush clubbed Gamrot with a huge overhand left that helped him secure the victory as he notched his eighth victory in a row in arguably the toughest division in the sport.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defining strike came with just over a minute remaining as Dariush leveled Gamrot with a huge overhand left. Gamrot dropped to the ground before diving for another takedown to stave off a potential finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the knockdown was the biggest strike in the fight as Dariush put on another stellar showcase while competing against a less established product in Gamrot. With the win, Dariush moves that much closer to title contention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one of the best parts for me came in Dariush&rsquo;s post fight interview.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7q0-Ypk7_HE"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Beneil Dariush Octagon Interview | UFC 280&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/7q0-Ypk7_HE&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Beneil Dariush Octagon Interview | UFC 280</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play 0:00-1:10</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I want to praise Dariush here, is because he&rsquo;s praising Jesus Christ in an area of the world where Islam is the dominant religion currently. Eventually it won&rsquo;t be, but for the time being, this was a bold statement in the United Emirates.&nbsp;</span></p>
