   <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Friday, March 3rd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Club Membership Plug:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2023/03/02/is-iran-less-than-two-weeks-away-from-having-a-nuclear-bomb-n2620152"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2023/03/02/is-iran-less-than-two-weeks-away-from-having-a-nuclear-bomb-n2620152</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Could Iran Make a Nuclear Bomb in Less Than Two Weeks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After it was reported this week that Iran had more than 18 times the amount of enriched uranium it was allowed to have under the Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Biden administration claimed Iran would need less than two weeks in order to finalize enrichment to produce the material needed for a nuclear bomb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1630679650249654273"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1&nbsp; 630679650249654273</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Calling Iran's nuclear progress "remarkable," Defense Under Secretary for Policy Colin Kahl told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that "it would take about twelve days" for Iran "to produce one bomb's worth of fissile material."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Recent evaluations by the International Atomic Energy Agency found that Iran has managed to enrich some of its uranium stockpiles to 84 percent, just shy of the 90 percent enrichment needed for fissile material in a nuclear bomb.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Kahl, as with everyone else in the Biden administration, sought to place blame for Iran's nuclear progress on the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the JCPOA &mdash; blame the mainstream media quickly repeated &mdash; but the 2015 nuclear deal was flawed and mostly served as a massive payday for the murderous regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">What's more, the Biden administration has wasted years trying to negotiate a new deal with Iran, while Biden's own State Department has admitted Iran played the United States by using lengthy and unserious negotiations to continue ramping up its nuclear efforts as it feigned good faith efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While President Biden and his administration were apparently content to continue pursuing diplomacy despite Iran using negotiations for its latest kabuki theater production, Israel is taking the threat more seriously and calling for international deterrents to Iran's nuclear ambitions. To that end, Israel's "Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and National Security Council chief Tzachi Hanegbi are set to fly out early next week to Washington for talks on progress made in Iran's nuclear program," the Jerusalem Post reports.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The situation is even more concerning given the deepening ties between Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea, and the fact that the United States' reaction to all this is being decided by Joe Biden &mdash; who has bungled multiple international incidents and hasn't shown himself able to present the United States as a powerful deterrent to bad actors on the world stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2023/03/02/discover-to-track-gun-purchases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2023/03/02/discover-to-track-gun-purchases/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Discover Card to Begin Tracking Gun Purchases in April</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Beginning in April 2023, Discover will become the first credit card issuer to track gun purchases made by their cardholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On September 11, 2022, Breitbart News noted that Visa caved to pressure from gun control groups and New York Democrats, agreeing to flag gun and ammo purchases via a new sales categorization. The Associated Press observed that Mastercard and other major credit cards also agreed to flag gun sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On March 2, 2023, the Independent Journal Review (IJR) reported that Discover will be first among credit card companies to track gun sales, inasmuch as the company will begin doing so in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">IJR explained, &ldquo;Anyone using a Discover card to make a purchase in a gun store will have that purchase tracked, beginning in April.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">There are over 55 million Discover cards in usage, so a lot of information on gun purchases can be gathered via that one company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Reuters pointed out Discover Financial Services was ahead of Visa and Mastercard in February 2023, noting that Discover would &ldquo;allow its network to track purchases at gun retailers come April, making it the first among its peers to publicly give a date for moving ahead with the initiative, which is aimed at helping authorities probe gun-related crimes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Discover told Reuters, &ldquo;We remain focused on continuing to protect and support lawful purchases on our network while protecting the privacy of cardholders.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The code for tracking gun purchases was approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in September 2022, and an ISO representative indicated, &ldquo;The decision to use the new merchant category code is eventually left up to the users in the industry.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-spends-nearly-100-million-house-migrants-hotels-after-out-state-busing?intcmp=tw_fnc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-spends-nearly-100-million-house-migrants-hotels-after-out-state-busing?intcmp=tw_fnc</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">NYC spends nearly $100 million to house migrants in hotels after out-of-state busing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">New York City&rsquo;s public hospital system will spend more than $90 million to house migrants at hotels in the Big Apple through the spring, local reports found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The ​​New York City Health + Hospitals Corporation, which operates public hospitals and clinics in the city, is tasked with overseeing housing for the influx of illegal immigrants. The group&rsquo;s CEO, Mitchell Katz, has approved spending millions on four hotels to house the migrants in Manhattan, the New York Post reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Katz approved $40 million to go to the four-star hotel Row NYC near Times Square, another $28 million to the four-star Stewart Hotel near Madison Square Garden, $20 million to the three-star hotel the Watson in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen and another $5.8 million to the two-star Wolcott Hotel near the Empire State Building, the Post and online publication The City reported this month. All in, the cost for housing the migrants through the spring of this year sits at $93.8 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At least 47,600 migrants have inundated the city since last year, including when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began sending buses of migrants to the city in August amid the ongoing border crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">There are a total of seven "Humanitarian Response and Relief Centers" in the city, including the four hotels, housing at the Wingate by Wyndham Hotel in Long Island City, one at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal and another at the Holiday Inn in the Financial District.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Since the beginning of this humanitarian crisis, New York City has mounted a multi-agency response to ensure we are meeting our moral obligations and providing compassionate, comprehensive care to those arriving in our city," a spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams told The City, "and NYC Health + Hospitals has been key in that response from the start."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The housing plans have come with a series of issues, including Row NYC found to throw out nearly a ton of food each day, according to a hotel whistleblower who previously spoke to the Post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While late last month, a group of migrants who were staying at the Watson Hotel in Midtown Manhattan refused to leave the hotel &ndash; and even protested by sleeping in the streets &ndash; after city officials said they would be housed at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Adams even slept at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal on the coldest night of the year earlier this month in an effort to fend off criticism that the facilities were lackluster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The mayor has meanwhile pleaded with the White House for more assistance from the government as the migrant population grows</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I have a Republican governor dumping on my city," Adams said last month. "I have a Democratic governor dumping on my city. That is where the national government should have stepped in and said, &lsquo;Wait a minute, let's coordinate this effort.&rsquo;"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis had also bused migrants to New York City and Chicago as the migrant crisis swelled in Denver and other areas, but announced a halt to the busing program last month after outcry from Adams and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Christian High School Withdraws From State Tournament Instead Of Facing Team With Transgender Player</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A girls&rsquo; high school basketball team in Vermont made a big decision last week when they opted out of playing in their biggest game of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The institution, Mid-Vermont Christian School forfeited their first-round state tournament game against Long Trail because the team didn&rsquo;t believe it was fair to play against a transgender athlete. They explained that their decision not to compete was based on concerns for player safety and fairness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Vermont state law permits transgender females to play in girls&rsquo; sporting leagues and prohibits discrimination based on gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players,&rdquo; a statement from MVCS head of school Vicky Fogg said. &ldquo;Allowing biological males to participate in women&rsquo;s sports sets a bad precedent for the future of women&rsquo;s sports in general.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The state acknowledged the school&rsquo;s decision and thus, their self-elimination from the postseason proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Vermont&rsquo;s policy regarding transgender athletes has led to other controversies recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In October, a middle school soccer coach from Randolph Union High School was suspended after he allegedly &lsquo;misgendered&rsquo; a trans student. This action came in the course of him defending his daughter, who said she was uncomfortable with the individual being in the girls&rsquo; locker room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also that month, administrators at the school banned members of the girls&rsquo; volleyball team after they also objected to sharing it with a fellow student who is biologically male.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That situation lit a fire of controversy surrounding the Randolph school, which lies in a community with a population of fewer than 5,000 people. There were several verbal taunts exchanged, some even leading to threats of violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://youtu.be/6nP0UPuuBCU"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Randolph Union High School draws national controversy over decision regarding transgender student...&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/6nP0UPuuBCU&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Randolph Union High School draws national controversy over decision regarding transgender student...</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Play Video 0:00-2:56</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While the policy regarding transgender athletes varies on the state level in high school, it has a uniform policy at the next level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Current NCAA rules state that transgender women are allowed to participate in women&rsquo;s sports after undergoing one year of testosterone suppression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During an April 2021 survey in the United States, 17 percent of male respondents and 24 percent of female respondents strongly supported allowing transgender girls to compete against other female athletes at the high school level.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepoliticalinsider.com/recent-study-shows-a-majority-of-americans-are-too-fat-and-dumb-to-join-the-military/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepoliticalinsider.com/recent-study-shows-a-majority-of-americans-are-too-fat-and-dumb-to-join-the-military/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent Study Shows a Majority of Americans are too Fat and Dumb to Join the Military</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the Pentagon had to grapple with quite a few negative headlines. The most alarming repetitive headline was that recruiting goals were not met across the board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, one might think that isn&rsquo;t a big deal given that we have pulled out of Afghanistan and aren&rsquo;t technically in an active war with anyone. That is, if you ignore the &lsquo;secret wars&rsquo; in Syria and Iraq and our proxy war with Russia in Ukraine, but I digress. This news rightly rocked legislators and should concern Americans at large because of our increased tensions with China, which seems to be inevitably heading toward a future war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, let&rsquo;s say you think the prospects of us finding ourselves in a hot war, like Afghanistan or a conflict with China, are slim to null. The fact that most young Americans couldn&rsquo;t join the military if they wanted to should matter to every American, as it directly reflects the type of society we currently elevate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent study has found that 77% of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 are physically unqualified to join the armed services, up 6% from 2017. To put that into simpler terms, over three-quarters of Americans within the prime military recruitment ages are too fat to raise their right hand to serve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at those two statistics I mentioned again. It might be bad now, but that same demographic was just as fat and unqualified six years ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to 2020 numbers, 42% of American adults are considered obese, with 19% on active duty falling into that category. That number is up from 16% of obesity in the active duty force in 2015.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, some of the blame, according to experts, falls on a food insecurity program many active duty and young Americans are forced to participate in. For example, the United States Department of Agriculture found in 2015 that 40% of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are obese.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 22,000 Active Duty and over 250,000 National Guard families receive SNAP benefits. For those of us familiar, that means a whole lot of government cheese and other processed food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&rsquo;s Bill Maher on the obesity crisis: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1555939261043511296"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1555939261043511296</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anybody who has tried to eat healthily knows it is costly and cumbersome. For example, research from Utah State University found that if a family of four were to grocery shop based on the healthy dietary guidelines, it would cost them approximately $14,400 annually.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recruiting dilemma facing the military, like most issues plaguing the Armed Forces, is multifaceted. Army Lt. Gen. Xavier Brunson explains, &ldquo;Some of the challenges we have are obesity, we have pre-existing medical conditions, we have behavioral health problems, we have criminality, people with felonies, and we have drug use.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s a pretty damning yet accurate depiction of America&rsquo;s youth. Additionally, many Americans need help to pass the education standards the Armed Forces require.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often joked as a test you get half credit for if you can spell your name right, the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) is used to see if you are smart enough to wear the uniform and what jobs you might have a natural aptitude for. According to security analyst Irina Tsukerman, &ldquo;falling intelligence and education standards&rdquo; have made the military less prepared for &ldquo;asymmetrical or conventional challenges.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Navy is tossing around the idea of lowering the minimum scores for acceptance on the AFQT and increasing the age ceiling from 35 to 41.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowering standards might increase the number of recruits, but what about the quality? The Army is opting to keep its standards but has stood up what they call the Future Soldier&rsquo;s Prep Course at Fort Jackson to get recruits whose scores are too low up to snuff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control classifies obesity as a security threat stating that 1 in 5 kids and 2 in 5 adults are obese. With American kids graduating high school without knowing how to read or do simple math, one could argue our public education system is also a security threat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/01/uk-cat-cull-was-considered-early-in-covid-crisis-ex-minister-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/01/uk-cat-cull-was-considered-early-in-covid-crisis-ex-minister-says</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK cat cull was considered early in Covid crisis, ex-minister says</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK government considered whether it might have to ask people to exterminate all pet cats during the early days of the Covid pandemic, a former health minister said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was unclear whether domestic cats could transmit coronavirus, James Bethell said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told Channel 4 News: &ldquo;What we shouldn&rsquo;t forget is how little we understood about this disease. There was a moment we were very unclear about whether domestic pets could transmit the disease.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In fact, there was an idea at one moment that we might have to ask the public to exterminate all the cats in Britain. Can you imagine what would have happened if we had wanted to do that?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2020, at the height of the Covid crisis, cat owners were warned not to kiss their pets after a female Siamese became the first known animal in the UK to catch the disease.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margaret Hosie, a professor of comparative virology at Glasgow University who led the screening programme, advised cat owners at the time to &ldquo;observe very careful hygiene&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes as Lord Bethell&rsquo;s boss at the time, Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, is facing a series of claims based on a leaked cache of more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The messages provide an insight into the way the UK government operated at the start of the pandemic. They include the suggestion that Hancock rejected advice from England&rsquo;s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, to test everyone going into care homes in England for Covid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hancock vehemently denies overruling clinical advice. A spokesperson called the claim &ldquo;categorically untrue&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Mayor Lightfoot reacts to election loss, says she was treated unfairly because of her race, gender</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/kPIdRJlzERo"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Ding Dong the Witch is Dead&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/kPIdRJlzERo&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Ding Dong the Witch is Dead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play 0:08-0:15</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How&rsquo;d that get in there?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ousted Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot explained away her Tuesday election loss as a result of her being a "Black woman in America."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightfoot faced eight challengers and finished Tuesday night's election in third place, failing to get enough support to continue into a runoff election. Reporters pressed her on whether she believed she was treated unfairly during the campaign process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I&rsquo;m a Black woman in America. Of course," she responded, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Regardless of tonight&rsquo;s outcome, we fought the right fights and we put this city on a better path," Lightfoot said Tuesday night, adding that serving as Chicago's mayor was "the honor of a lifetime." She also blamed the tricksie hobbitses for her loss.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those keeping score: Paul Vallas lead the way with 33.8% of the vote, Brandon Johnson received 20.3%, and Lightfoot received 17.1%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Lightfoot out of the race, Chicago Public Schools CEO and city budget director Paul Vallas will face off against Cook County Board of Commissioners member Brandon Johnson in the April 4 runoff. Neither candidate reached the 50% necessary to win the election outright on Tuesday, though Vallas came closest with 33%.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi Bans &lsquo;Gender-Affirming Care&rsquo; for Minors</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi has become the latest state to ban health care professionals from providing &ldquo;gender-affirming care&rdquo; for transgender youth in what officials say will stop the attempt to &ldquo;push a sick and twisted ideology&rdquo; on children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, signed the GOP-led House Bill 1125, also known as the &ldquo;Regulate Experimental Adolescent Procedures (REAP) Act&rdquo; into law on Feb. 28.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the legislation, which is effective immediately, individuals in the state are banned from &ldquo;knowingly engaging in conduct that aids or abets&rdquo; the performance or inducement of gender transition procedures for Mississippians under the age of 18.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also prevents public funds or tax deductions for prohibited gender transition procedures, noting that the direct or indirect use, grant, payment, or distribution of public funds to any entity, organization, or individual that provides gender transition procedures to individuals under the age of 18 is also prohibited.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also puts in place enforcement procedures on the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure. Any health care professional found to be in violation of the ban will have their license to practice medicine in the state revoked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure, which also prevents Medicaid from reimbursing or providing coverage for gender transition for persons under the age of 18, allows for health care providers to be sued by their former patients, via their &ldquo;parent or next friend&rdquo; within 30 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate statement on Twitter shortly before signing the law, Reeves said there are individuals in the state who are &ldquo;attempting to push a sick and twisted ideology that seeks to convince our kids they&rsquo;re in the wrong body and the solution is to drug, sterilize, and castrate themselves.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signing of the bill makes Mississippi the latest state to enact a ban on gender-affirming care after South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, also a Republican, signed a similar &ldquo;Help Not Harm&rdquo; bill into law last month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar bans have also been passed in Alabama, Arizona, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah, although some of them are currently being blocked by lawsuits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska and Oklahoma are also considering similar bills and last month, Republican Florida state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia introduced a bill that would require businesses that cover the cost of gender-transition medical care for their employees to pay for any subsequent detransition care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters of such bills claim that they are intended to safeguard children. Experts have said that four out of five children grow out of gender dysphoria once they reach adolescence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, opponents, including a string of major medical organizations like the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychological Association, have all voiced support for gender transition care among minors, arguing that it is safe and effective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which works to &ldquo;protect and defend individuals&rsquo; rights,&rdquo; said in a statement on Tuesday that the new legislation &ldquo;shuts the door on medical best practice and puts politics between parents, their children, and their doctors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This life-saving care was already difficult to access for trans youth across the state, and is now entirely out of reach,&rdquo; ACLU said. &ldquo;Our politicians continue to fail trans youth &mdash; but we will never stop fighting back against this ongoing attack against trans rights across the nation. Trans youth shouldn&rsquo;t have to fight this hard to be who they are.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today the Pugsters take up the notorious Klaus Schawb's prediction for an ideal future: "You will own nothing and you will be happy." Just what sort of human being would you need to be in order for this to be appealing, or even make sense. Chris proposes--you would need to be a plastic pleasure monkey. But is that so? Or are there other truer ways to think about human beings? If so, what are they? On today's show the guys turn to Christian metaphysics, Aristotle, and the US Declaration of Independence to find out!</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, March 1st, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$500 billion question: The real cost of Supreme Court decision on Biden student loan plan</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gargantuan price tag for President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan is garnering renewed scrutiny as the Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments on the constitutionality of the policy Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Biden announced a plan to eliminate $10,000 in student loan debt to borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and $20,000 in loan forgiveness to Pell Grant recipients.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy, which has been blocked by federal courts prior to the Supreme Court's review, would cost $400 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which said it was "highly uncertain" about the estimate. Meanwhile, a study from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business said the cost could easily exceed $500 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, Biden&rsquo;s Department of Education unveiled new proposed regulations that substantially overhauled the department&rsquo;s income-driven repayment program, which allows low-income borrowers to make lower monthly payments than their loan would otherwise provide. The Penn-Wharton model estimated that the total cost of the proposed changes to the income-driven repayment program, coupled with the widespread forgiveness plan, could push the cost beyond $1 trillion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan, despite its eye-popping price tag, has drawn praise from members of the president's party, who blasted Republicans for attempting to block the policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Republican politicians have blasted the policy as an unfair redistribution of wealth from noncollege-educated workers to educated elites and raised alarms about the policy's cost to the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) noted in a statement to the Washington Examiner the plan's accompanying price tag and added that the administration's continued extension of a pause on collecting payments had cost "taxpayers $195 billion.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Education and Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) told the Washington Examiner that she was optimistic that the court would strike down the administration's policy and called on the president to work with Congress to reform the federal student loan program.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN Hits 10-Year Low As Fox News Glides To Victory In Cable News Ratings</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">February marked CNN&rsquo;s lowest-rated month in a decade, with the network&rsquo;s prime time lineup dropping 42% among viewers 25-54&mdash;the key demographic group valued by advertisers&mdash;compared to the same month one year ago. CNN drew an average prime time audience of 122,000 viewers in the key demo, compared to Fox News Channel&rsquo;s 299,000 viewers (down 33%). MSNBC was third overall with 119,000 viewers (down 15%).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among total viewers, Fox News dominated prime time with 2.262 million viewers, followed by MSNBC (1.165 million viewers) and CNN (587,000 viewers). All of the networks saw year-over-year declines, with CNN down the most at 24%. Fox News was down 14% and MSNBC declined the least, down 2%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News had 94 of the 100 most-watched telecasts in February, which marked two consecutive years as the highest-rated network in cable news, among both total viewers and viewers in the key demo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most-watched show in cable news for the month was FNC&rsquo;s The Five, which drew an average total audience of 3.310 million viewers, followed by Tucker Carlson Tonight (3.303 million viewers), Jesse Watters Primetime (2.833 million viewers), Hannity (2.684 million viewers), and Special Report with Bret Baier (2.439 million viewers)&mdash;all airing on the Fox News Channel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the key demo, Tucker Carlson Tonight finished the month in first place with an average audience of 461,000 viewers, followed by The Five (371,000 viewers), Hannity (355,000 viewers), Gutfeld! (322,000 viewers), and Jesse Watters Primetime (314,000 viewers)&mdash;all airing on Fox News.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-asks-congress-to-reauthorize-fisa-surveillance-powers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-asks-congress-to-reauthorize-fisa-surveillance-powers</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Admin Asks Congress To Reauthorize FISA Surveillance Powers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of an expiration date at the end of the year, the Biden administration formally requested on Tuesday that Congress reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), a controversial spy program used to combat threats around the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Merrick Garland and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines sent a letter to congressional leaders arguing that maintaining Title VII is a &ldquo;top legislative priority&rdquo; for the Biden administration. The letter places particular emphasis on Section 702, which was enacted in 2008 and is used to monitor non-U.S. citizens abroad, but Title VII also contains other sections that concern procedures and protections for surveillance of U.S. persons abroad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garland and Haines argue Section 702 has been critical in identifying and protecting against national security threats to the United States and its allies, including &ldquo;conventional and cyber threats&rdquo; posed by China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They listed some examples touting Section 702&rsquo;s usefulness, including noting that it contributed to the operation that led to a CIA drone strike in Afghanistan killing Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy and civil liberty advocates have raised concerns about warrantless surveillance due to the mass incidental collection of data, including the communications of Americans in contact with a foreign target, and the mishandling of surveillance powers, such as the FBI&rsquo;s targeting of a Trump 2016 campaign aide using an unverified dossier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have already signaled opposition to FISA as it stands. Among them are Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), who this month called for &ldquo;meaningful reforms&rdquo; to protect Fourth Amendment rights, and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), who sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray two weeks ago demanding answers about &ldquo;backdoor searches&rdquo; sifting through FISA data that appear to have targeted politicians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Congress will have a chance to grill the Biden administration about the FISA program, as Garland and Haines are set to appear before key committees in the coming days.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toxic Chemical Waste from Ohio Now Headed to Other States</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contaminated waste from the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, is being shipped to Indiana and could also be heading to other states in the wake of the ongoing cleanup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have already been fifteen truckloads of toxic waste disposed of in Michigan, while five truckloads carrying 280 tons had been in East Palestine, according to an update from Ohio Governor Mike DeWine&rsquo;s office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report added that liquid waste had been disposed of at a Texas treatment site, while 02,000 gallons of liquid waste remains in East Palestine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPA&rsquo;s regional administrator, Debra Shore, said that solid waste would be sent to an incinerator operated by Ross Environmental Services in Grafton, Ohio, and also a Heritage hazardous waste landfill in Roachdale, Indiana, which also operates the facility in East Liverpool.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two facilities in Ohio, which began taking in shipments on Monday, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have enough capacity to handle all the liquid and solid waste from this cleanup,&rdquo; Shore explained. This means the agency had to look for other disposal locations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a demonstration held by local Republicans and residents in Michigan said: &ldquo;Stop these shipments. Do not bring these shipments to Michigan.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas officals said they were unaware that toxic materials from the crash were being sent to a site near them until they heard about it from the press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unacceptable,&rdquo; Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said. &ldquo;I know our community was taken aback by the news just as much as I was.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ohio derailment saw 38 rail cars containing hazardous material go off the tracks earlier this month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio residents have since complained of mysterious symptoms after being exposed to the toxic chemicals</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials have since discovered toxic chemicals in the soil surrounding the derailment site and in nearby waterways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, an attorney representing more than 30,000 people impacted by 9/11, warned East Palestine residents not to trust what the EPA says about water quality.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Being Removed From Super Bowl Coverage, Michael Irvin and Attorneys DEMAND Marriott Release Super Bowl Surveillance Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout his Hall of Fame playing career with the Dallas Cowboys and even since Michael Irvin has been no stranger to controversy. Or, for that matter? Brushes with the law here and there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvin has been arrested multiple times over the years for everything from drug possession charges to assault. Always volatile, the former University of Miami Hurricane has been known to display an explosive temper. One that he displayed quite often.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an incident that took place at the Cowboys&rsquo; training facility in 1998, he stabbed teammate Everett McIver in the neck with a pair of scissors when the younger player refused to get up from a barber chair. Though McIver survived the attack, the wound could have been fatal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvin&rsquo;s checkered history also includes multiple allegations of sexual misconduct that date back to the early days of his playing career.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1996, a woman alleged that she was sexually assaulted by Irvin and his Cowboys teammate Erik Williams. Authorities concluded that her allegations were fabricated. The accuser later recanted her story. In 2007, Irvin was accused of sexual battery by a woman who said he got her drunk and raped her at a Florida hotel. Criminal charges were never filed, but she filed a civil lawsuit in 2010.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fort Lauderdale, Florida, police investigated Irvin for an alleged sexual assault on March 22, 2017. Then, on July 24, the Broward County State Attorney&rsquo;s Office announced they had closed the investigation and would not charge Irvin in the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward to 2023. Prior to this year&rsquo;s Super Bowl coverage, Irvin was pulled from his duties as a commentator for the NFL Network, due to more allegations. This time, it was for an exchange at a Marriott hotel between the Hall of Famer and the accuser. However, details both then and now regarding their interaction remains unclear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvin immediately denied any wrongdoing, saying that his only interaction with the woman included nothing more than a mere handshake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We shook hands. Then, I left. &hellip; That&rsquo;s all I know,&rdquo; Irvin explained to The Dallas Morning News when the story broke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, Irvin has professed his innocence, and he is now asking for surveillance video to be released to clear him of any wrongdoing. The Playmaker is also now pursuing legal action against the woman and the hotel chain, and he got a big win in the matter late last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvin&rsquo;s lawyers had been arguing that he had the right to view the video, as the accusations involved could jeopardize not only his public persona but his potential to earn millions as a television personality, as well. In essence, they are looking to clear the star&rsquo;s name completely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must have worked because it appears now that Marriott hotels and their parent company won&rsquo;t have much choice in the matter. A federal judge ordered Marriott to release the Michael Irvin security video.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, things came to a head in the matter when Judge Amos Mazzant III ruled in the East District of Texas that Marriott has until 5 p.m. on Tuesday to answer the request for &ldquo;any and all video recordings, written reports, and/or witness statements gathered that pertain to Michael Irvin&rsquo;s stay at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel in February 2023.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a notice to produce the video and other materials, it&rsquo;s merely setting a deadline for Marriott&rsquo;s response. It&rsquo;s still not clear how this will all play out. And unless someone decides to fold, this could be a long standoff between the parties involved. In most legal situations such as these, it is essentially the &lsquo;smoking gun,&rsquo; the evidence that will make or break a case. Marriott&rsquo;s only argument here could be claiming that the footage is private property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it&rsquo;s looking more and more like the corporation will be forced to give up any pertinent material they have in relation to the complaint.</span></p>

   <title><![CDATA[Having Two Legs: Tucker Carlson & A Case Study in Christian Nationalism & Theocratic Conservatism [Pastor Toby’s Blog]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/55470ef5-66b3-497a-86e8-f2e4a2231e59/having-two-legs-tucker-carlson-a-case-study-in-christian-nationalism-theocratic-conservatism-1.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tucker Carlson &amp; A Case Study in Christian Nationalism &amp; Theocratic Conservatism&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One may wonder how the algorithmic gods of the medias mutter and chirp and old clips of Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro emerge from the ancient shadows, but be assured that they do and when they do, they provide one with opportunities to pull your son aside, like Solomon in Proverbs and say, do you see that man? Yeah, not like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the particular clip that is currently making the rounds is from 2018, and a great deal of water has gone under the old proverbial bridge and has flowed many miles hence, even to the wild lands of Wuhan and beyond. And so one might hope that greater light has come into the great Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s eyes. I mean, if they can lock us down, close our churches, foist useless, perhaps even harmful masks on our faces, and demand injections or else you&rsquo;re a hater, a bigot, and a scoundrel, perhaps he&rsquo;s had a change of heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the clip is from when a Ben Shapiro interview of Tucker Carlson, where Tucker argues that since family is the foundational building block of society and an unmitigated good, society ought to take steps to protect it and defend it. And certain technological advances that threaten that good ought to be curbed and perhaps even prohibited. Tucker says that if we don&rsquo;t we may very soon end up with a situation where a reasonably well-adjusted college graduate (one who doesn&rsquo;t smoke pot) may not have the means to provide for himself, much less take a wife, and raise a family with her. And when pressed by Ben Shapiro about the possibility of Artificial Intelligence driving trucks on American highways, Tucker says that if he was President he would absolutely order the Department of Transportation to ban all AI on federal highways because if they didn&rsquo;t millions of jobs would be lost. And truck driving is one of the most common jobs for high school educated men in America.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Setting the Table</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let&rsquo;s set the table carefully here. First, it&rsquo;s absolutely true that the natural family is the foundational building block of society. Second, let&rsquo;s agree that society should do everything lawfully in its power to protect and encourage family formation and flourishing. But here is where the questions begin to array themselves. What actually is &ldquo;lawfully in its power?&rdquo; Can the state simply do anything that appears to contribute to some notion of the &ldquo;common good?&rdquo; How should society protect and encourage natural family formation? My previously stated proposal is that as Protestant Christians we must begin with the clear instructions given in Scripture and then work our way out from those by good and necessary consequence, by the light of nature and Christian prudence. So I don&rsquo;t think we need an explicit Bible verse about AI and truck drivers, but I do think we need clear-eyed biblical principles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple problems with Tucker&rsquo;s proposal, beginning with him acting like a socialist. The assumption of socialism/Marxism is that there is no God, and therefore the state must take His place. Since there is no God to do justice, rendering unto each man what he deserves, the State takes unto itself this responsibility. Fascism need not be dark and bloody at first. It simply claims the right to command commerce and markets for the &ldquo;common good&rdquo; of society, for the good of families and family values. But it&rsquo;s still fascism and socialism for all that, even if the state is commanding Bible reading and church attendance. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand: I&rsquo;m not saying that Tucker&rsquo;s second presidential fiat would be compulsory Bible reading and church attendance. But why exactly not?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, these soft-socialist/fascist policies claim a kind omniscience. Tucker claims that millions of jobs will be lost in a matter of years. But this sounds like the conservative equivalent of the environmental doomsdayers. If you don&rsquo;t ban plastic bags today, the oceans will rise in five years and millions will die! Or sometimes they even notice real problems, like for example, air pollution. But as Alex Epstein has helpfully catalogued, over and over again, there&rsquo;s a certain simplistic and narrow mindset that looks at one factor and multiplies it by a million without accounting for all the other possibilities and concludes that the apocalyptic outcome is inevitable! And that&rsquo;s trying to be god while sucking at it. So when environmentalists have projected air pollution from coal and oil and other fossil fuels, what they have consistently not accounted for is adaptation, creativity, ingenuity, and improvements in technology which mitigate, minimize, and sometimes completely undo the dangers and potential harms. People, made in the image of God, are like God, and despite our fallen natures, they are generally trying to improve things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tucker&rsquo;s comments struck me as not only tapping into that false socialist omniscience, but they were demeaning and condescending to the very human beings he was claiming to want to protect and help, while apparently completely forgetting about other human beings in the equation. Now, it&rsquo;s an entirely open question as to whether it would ever actually work to have AI drive trucks in this country. At the very least, we would want to have a chain of liability clearly articulated, and like the goring ox in Exodus 21, require restitution and harsh penalties for any harm or damage that occurs. But why does Tucker paint the drug free college graduate like a helpless victim? Why are working class high school graduates being described as completely dependent on truck driving jobs? Can they not do anything else? A few decades ago they worked in American factories, but after the government got involved in &ldquo;helping&rdquo; them, they all got sent overseas. And here we are suggesting more Big Government involvement to help &ldquo;fix&rdquo; inequities. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the government and we&rsquo;re here to help,&rdquo; are still the most terrifying words in the English language, even when they are in the mouth of so-called &ldquo;common good&rdquo; conservatives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the fact of the matter is that even if the tech and liabilities all got sufficiently sorted, and people started experimenting with AI truck drivers, the change wouldn&rsquo;t happen overnight. But as it started to happen (if it ever did), you would immediately be funding all the developers, troubleshooters, repairment, maintenance, and updates needed to grow and improve that new technology. The other part of the &ldquo;inevitability-omniscience&rdquo; complex is a failure to see that new technology only ever depends upon human beings creating it, maintaining, fixing it, improving, and so on. Read </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life After Google</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by George Gilder and repent of your implicit Darwinism. Artificial intelligence will always be completely dependent upon human intelligence. So just as a new technology begins to break into markets, new human jobs come into being. And this is how it has always worked. As technology changes, some folks are laid off and find new creative outlets, but all of that new technology also always creates new needs for human workers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Biblical Common Good</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biblical vision of the common good is each sphere of government exercising the power delegated to it by Christ obediently. The Magisterial Reformers were working in a particular historical moment where church government had way overreached its bounds, and part of the way you begin to limit overweening powers is by reinvigorating the balance of powers. In the days of Luther and Calvin it was absolutely necessary to call the magistrates to take up the sword of justice and push back the encroachments of the Papal See. However, we now live in an era where the state has become the Infallible Mouth of God, and it&rsquo;s high time ministers of the gospel declared the Lordship of Christ and commanded magistrates back into their own lane, while insisting that husbands and fathers, wives and mothers step up to the plate and take back their authority in the home and marketplace. Until a crime has been actually committed, it is an unjust use of violence to manipulate markets. I understand that when you live in a snake pit of market regulations the temptation is to simply join the mafia and release your own &ldquo;good&rdquo; snakes into the mix, but as we learn from one of those lesser known Mosaic principles, never bring more snakes to a snake pit unless your snake will swallow all of them and turn back into a walking stick when it&rsquo;s done.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">God has established three governments among men: the family, the church, and the state. These governments are not water-tight jurisdictions, but function more like a Venn diagram with clear differences and some overlap. God has assigned to the family the jurisdiction of health, welfare, and education. God has assigned to the church the ministry of worship and discipleship, the administration of Word and sacrament. God has assigned to the state the ministry of the sword of justice. Closely related is the difference between sins and crimes. We see this distinction beginning in the differing ministries of Abraham and Melchizedek, Moses and Aaron, as well as the differing penalties provided in the Mosaic law. When the law says that someone will be &ldquo;cut off from among his people,&rdquo; this is the ordinary discipline of Old Testament family and &ldquo;church.&rdquo; When the penalty prescribed is restitution or stripes or death, this the ministry of the sword. Now granted these are not pristine, Euclidian categories. Many of the laws in the Mosaic code have moral, ceremonial, and civil elements to them. Nevertheless, ceremonial laws were under the jurisdiction of the priests and civil laws were under the jurisdiction of the judges and magistrates. But the fact that family law was also being established in the Mosaic law is profound. Laws surrounding marriage and divorce and remarriage within families, with instructions for what might be appealed to civil magistrates for civil penalties begin to establish these jurisdictional differences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, not all sins are or should be crimes. Covetousness is a sin but not a crime. Lying is always a sin, but not all lies should be adjudicated as crimes. Lust is a sin, even adultery in the heart, but until the lust is acted upon in fornication or adultery, there is no crime to adjudicate. A rebellious son ought to be disciplined by his own parents for many years before they determine to appeal to the civil magistrate for criminal penalties. But here is where the jurisdictions overlap: if a true biblical crime has been committed in a family or church, the civil magistrate is authorized by God to intervene. A civil magistrate my seek a warrant to arrest a father and pastor for sexual abuse. But by the same token, a father may resist or ignore tyrannical orders given a magistrate and a pastor may rebuke a magistrate and command him to repent of his sin, just as John did and lost his head for it. When a church excommunicates a professing Christian, barring them from the Lord&rsquo;s Supper and fellowship in the local church, the church is exercising its power to protect truth and morality in a society. When a family disciplines its young children teaching them Christian virtues the family government is doing its part to cultivate families and work ethics and morality. The family has the power to ultimately disinherit a son or daughter for gross immorality or apostasy. And it is the job of the state to punish crimes as defined by Scripture. No crime has been committed if a trucking company fires a driver in favor of an AI driver.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the clip mentioned, Tucker Carlson says that even though he believes in free markets it&rsquo;s not an absolute or religious commitment or requirement. He says there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;Nicene Creed of Capitalism&rdquo; he has to subscribe to. Now he&rsquo;s absolutely right if he means that free markets may not be used to justify committing crimes (e.g. theft, murder, etc.). But what Tucker is actually proposing is denying jobs and livelihoods to those working in AI, and by the making it a law, he&rsquo;s threatening the use of violence for those who try. In the name of doing good and protecting families, Tucker is proposing that he be the one who gets to choose the winners and the losers. Truckers are the winners; programmers and new tech are the losers. Sorry, the gods have spoken. We know what&rsquo;s best for you. And actually, we&rsquo;ve decided that cars have taken too many jobs away from horses and mules. So yeah, we&rsquo;re going back to the Middle Ages, you greedy capitalist pigs. But seriously, where&rsquo;s the line?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, I&rsquo;ll stop here. Tucker says there&rsquo;s no Nicene Creed of capitalism, and that&rsquo;s true enough, but there is a Nicene Creed that says that God is the &ldquo;Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible&hellip;&rdquo; Invisible things would include market forces, the creativity and ingenuity of men, as well as their created needs and desires.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until or unless God gives a government the authority to step in, it is a violation of the Nicene Creed to grasp power for yourself and violently or coercively prohibit the free actions and creativity of people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must always be remembered that if the primary power of the state is the power of the sword, then whenever you call for a &ldquo;ban,&rdquo; you are simultaneously calling for the use of violent, coercive force to be used if someone disregards the ban. I&rsquo;m sorry, but we just had a few years of a police state trial run in the West with law enforcement fining churches for being open, for mandated gags on peoples&rsquo; faces, and frog marching decent law-abiding citizens off to jail for singing songs in public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do believe in the &ldquo;common good,&rdquo; but the common good is determined by God&rsquo;s Word and not simplistic, short-sighted calculations. It was those kinds of simplistic, short-sighted calculations that the Imperial College of London used to insight the COVID panic. So, no thanks. God&rsquo;s world is more resilient, more complex, more glorious than that.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/cf94952b-29fc-4433-bb0e-cfc8aceadaf2/having-two-legs-real-communion.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Real Communion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The table of the Lord&rsquo;s is a table of communion and fellowship. This is why we call it Communion. It is communion with God, and it is communion with God&rsquo;s people. This is why Paul told the Corinthians that when they came together to eat this meal it was not really the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. There were divisions among the Corinthians, rivalries, resentments, and elbows being thrown. You can&rsquo;t celebrate communion while being out of communion with God or your neighbor, your husband, your wife, your parents, your kids, or roommates. It says that when the Corinthians tried to do that many of them got sick and some had even died.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the Old Testament, when the Israelites complained against God that there was no meat to eat in the wilderness, He gave them quail, but that meat became poison to all those with evil hearts. Likewise, God told Israel that if a man suspected his wife of adultery, he could bring her to the tabernacle and the priest could give her a drink that would function as a jealousy test. In some ways, the Lord&rsquo;s table functions like that. If you are in fellowship with God and one another, the bread and cup are grace and strength and blessing. But if you come to the table harboring secret sins, or grievances or out of fellowship with someone, you need to know that by eating and drinking, you are inviting Christ in. Christ is there, and it is communion with Christ. But if you eat and drinking communion while trying to preserve disunion, divisions, and strife, the meal will be a curse.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The answer is not to abstain from the table. If you are baptized, you really must come.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t cling to your sin and abstain from the meal. Rather, let go of your sin now. Drop your sin now. Determine in your heart right now to kill that sin, to confess it, to forsake it, to be reconciled to your brother or sister as soon as possible. If you do that, then the Lord&rsquo;s Supper will strengthen you for that fight, strengthen you to do what needs to be done to restore fellowship.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">So consider your wife, your husband, your kids, your parents, your roommates, your friends. Is all well? Or do you need to go find them right now, call them, text them an apology and ask for forgiveness? Then do it. Then the Lord&rsquo;s supper will truly be communion, communion with the Lord Jesus Christ, whose blood reconciles every sin.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In Chapter 8 of Paradise Restored, David Chilton discusses what it means that Christ is King and ruling in His Kingdom. Like a stone that becomes a mountain and like a seed that becomes a tree, Jesus' Kingdom is growing and increasing day-by-day. Jesus is seated on His throne and is ruling at the Father's right hand right now. With His atoning Death and subsequent Resurrection, Jesus has bound the strong man (Satan) and is plundering his house.</p>

<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/21/biden-admin-religious-student-groups-protections-campus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/21/biden-admin-religious-student-groups-protections-campus/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Admin Looking To Remove Religious Student Groups&rsquo; Protections On Campus</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education (DOE) announced a proposal Tuesday rescinding a Trump-era policy that prohibited universities from receiving federal funding if they restricted religious student group activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 policy, initially signed by former President Donald Trump as part of an executive order in 2019, was proposed to prevent universities from censoring the speech of religious students on campus, according to the Washington Post. The DEO&rsquo;s recent announcement indicates that President Joe Biden is looking to end the policy, claiming the protections caused an &ldquo;unduly burdensome role&rdquo; for the department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[T]he Department believes it is not necessary in order to protect the First Amendment right to free speech and free exercise of religion given existing legal protections, it has caused confusion about schools&rsquo; nondiscrimination requirements, and it prescribed a novel and unduly burdensome role for the Department in investigating allegations regarding public institutions&rsquo; treatment of religious student organizations,&rdquo; the announcement read. &ldquo;We have not seen evidence that the regulation has provided meaningfully increased protection for religious student organizations beyond the robust First Amendment protections that already exist, much less that it has been necessary to ensure they are able to organize and operate on campus.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement came from Nassar H. Paydar, Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Education, who explained that since September 2021 the DOE had been looking into current policies regarding the First Amendment that &ldquo;impose additional requirements on its higher education institutional grant recipients.&rdquo; Paydar noted that during that time, the DOE determined that the 2020 policy had placed a burden on the higher education system and did not provide any &ldquo;meaningfully increased protection for religious student organizations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told the Washington Post that the rule protects religious students from being &ldquo;forced to choose between their faith and their education&rdquo; and would also protect religious universities from being turned away for federal funding because of their religious affiliation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The public comment phase will begin on Wednesday, Feb. 22, and remain open for 30 days for anyone to comment and provide their thoughts on the proposal, according to the announcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alaska-republican-touts-benefits-children-being-abused-death-1782972"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsweek.com/alaska-republican-touts-benefits-children-being-abused-death-1782972</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alegislature in Alaska caused outrage after questioning whether the death of child abuse victims could be "a cost savings," because it would mean they don't need "government services" later in life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican David Eastman, who sits in the Alaska House of Representatives, made the comment on Monday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee was meeting to discuss how children are impacted by physical or sexual abuse, as well as witnessing domestic violence within their family home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers were shown a study indicating each incident of fatal child abuse costs society $1.5 million, a figure reached by assessing the impact of trauma and the child's loss of earnings over a lifetime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Eastman was unimpressed, and questioned whether fatal child abuse could be economically beneficial to wider society, an argument he claimed to have heard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eastman said: "It can be argued, periodically, that it's actually a cost savings because that child is not going to need any of those government services that they might otherwise be entitled to receive and need based on growing up in this type of environment."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remark horrified Trevor Storrs, president of the Alaska Children's Trust (ACT), who hit back describing the loss of a child as "unmeasurable."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Representative Cliff Groh, who used to work as a prosecutor covering child abuse allegations, said he was "disturbed" by Easterman's comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representative Sarah Vance, the Republican who claims the House Judiciary Committee, said Easterman, who doesn't serve on any committees, had been at the hearing "at my invitation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance later suggested Eastman had been trying to make an argument against abortion, which some consider to be "child abuse."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with the Anchorage Daily News via text message, Eastman said: "I was pleased to hear ACT advocating against child abuse, but a child's value comes not from future productivity, but from the fact that every child is made in the image of God."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-police-defunding-crime-ravages-locals-huge-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-police-defunding-crime-ravages-locals-huge-crisis</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle reverses course on defunding police as crime ravages locals: 'A huge crisis'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle residents Victoria Beach, Eli Hoshor and Jonathan Choe said police shortages have left their city in dire straits in the aftermath of officials' anti-law enforcement rhetoric.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homicides skyrocketed by 24% while motor vehicle thefts climbed by 30% in the city last year. Overall crime ticked up by 4%.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Bruce Harrell pushed for increased police presence to curb the issue Tuesday, saying, "We need immediate action and innovation to respond to our public safety issues&hellip; Seattle saw a 4% rise in reported crime last year&hellip; We need more officers to address our staffing crisis."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, some residents' outlook is less than optimistic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piro reported data from Seattle's city's budget office showing funding for law enforcement increased for the first time since a major slash was made in 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoshor, a resident, says the uptick is not enough to reduce crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The crime is just getting worse and worse," he said. "There's a homeless encampment that's right next to my son's school that's been there for over a year, and it's doubled and tripled in size.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choe, a reporter from the area, slammed the "Defund the Police" movement for being behind the crime rise as well as the "woke" activist class who he said are perpetuating the problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that seeing how "Defund the Police" supporters respond to Harrell's push for more police and the uptick in funding for the department should be "interesting."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle forced to pay $3.6 MILLION in 2020 CHAZ damages to business owners</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Seattle has agreed to pay $3,650,000 in damages to business owners who brought suit after the deadly 2020 Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) damaged their business, property, and violated their constitutional rights. The group had originally been seeking $2.9 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city has until March 3 to pay the sum as part of a settlement revealed last week. According to court filings regarding the settlement, $600,000 will go toward attorney fees for the more than a dozen plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The settlement came just weeks after a federal judge imposed sanctions against the city for deleting thousands of text messages between Seattle officials including former Mayor Jenny Durkan, former police chief Carmen Best, and Fire Chief Harold Scoggins during the armed occupation by Antifa and BLM rioters of 6 square blocks of the Capitol Hill neighborhood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CHAZ, also known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest or CHOP, was established by activists on June 8, 2020, after Seattle police were ordered by police leadership to abandon the department&rsquo;s East Precinct during the riots that rocked the Emerald City in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minn. on May 25, 2020. Video of his death emerged, setting off months of riots in the midst of a pandemic.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zone occupiers refused to allow police into the area. Rapes, robberies, and murders spiked 250 percent in the 6-block area during the occupation. The zone lasted 3 weeks before it was finally broken up by police on July 1, 2020, after two fatal shootings and rioters vandalized then Mayor Durkan's home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1271249933765656578"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1271249933765656578</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court documents, business owners alleged that city officials&rsquo; "unprecedented decision to abandon and close off" the 16-block section of the neighborhood "subjected businesses, employees, and residents to extensive property damage, public safety dangers, and an inability to use and access their properties."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was revealed after the occupation that Seattle officials, including former Mayor Jenny Durkan, former police chief Carmen Best, and Fire Chief Harold Scoggins deleted thousands of text messages from their city-owned phones regarding the zone, including communications with the infamous &ldquo;warlord&rdquo; of the autonomous zone, Raz Simone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US District Judge Thomas Zilly previously sanctioned the city and thereby allowed the jury to view the missing evidence as a strike against the city in the case. Zilly Wrote, &ldquo;City officials deleted thousands of text messages from their city-owned phones in complete disregard of their legal obligation to preserve relevant evidence. Further, the city significantly delayed disclosing &hellip; that thousands of text messages had been deleted&rdquo; and could not be reproduced or recovered.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR to Cut Workforce by 10 Percent, as Advertising Slowdown Hits Public Media</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our financial outlook has darkened considerably over recent weeks,&rdquo; Lansing wrote in a memo to staff Wednesday. &ldquo;At a time when we are doing some of our most ambitious and essential work, the global economy remains uncertain. As a result, the ad industry has weakened and we are grappling with a sharp decline in our revenues from corporate sponsors. We had created a plan to address a $20M sponsorship revenue falloff for FY23 but we are now projecting at least a $30M shortfall. The cuts we have already made to our budget will not be enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Lansing says that most of NPR&rsquo;s open jobs will be eliminated, and that it will be reducing its existing workforce by 10 percent. More than 700 employees work at the public media firm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lansing also suggested that the necessary job cuts will result in a more refined mission for NPR as an organization, writing that &ldquo;some work will need to change or stop entirely,&rdquo; and that NPR&rsquo;s executive committee is figuring out where it needs to continue investing, and where it should pull back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of NPR&rsquo;s most popular programs (on both terrestrial radio and in podcast form) include Fresh Air, Planet Money, Wait Wait&hellip; Don&rsquo;t Tell Me, and Up First. It also has a sizable news division that produces journalism that runs across its programming.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former NFL Player Eric Johnson Among 8 People Arrested For Human Trafficking &amp; Gang Charges</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson, 46, played in The League from 2000-2005 with the Oakland Raiders, Atlanta Falcons, and Arizona Cardinals. He&rsquo;s now part of an apparent trafficking ring that stands accused of multiple acts involving four adult women and one female minor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr says the LOTTO Gang members &ndash; including Johnson &ndash; are facing charges of trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, violation of the street gang terrorism and prevention act, conspiracy to violate the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) Act, aggravated assault and kidnapping.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he&rsquo;s certainly not a household name by any means, Eric Johnson is known for one significant moment in NFL history. He scored a touchdown in the Raiders&rsquo; 48-21 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII. He blocked a punt and then returned it for 13 yards for the score.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This week&rsquo;s show engages one dimension of our current identity crisis in the West by attending the increasing loss of our ability to discern, define, and acknowledge the distinction between created natures and purposes and the artificial and constructed. Tom, Chris and Glenn unpack the topic by looking at the history of this loss and some of its core ingredients: theological and philosophical errors about divinity, creation, humanity and the increased use of scientific technique in bending nature to our will and wishes. In looking at the character and consequences of this shift in Western thought and culture, the guys discuss some of the rich analysis of Oliver O&rsquo;Donovan in his classic work: Begotten or Made? and Mathias Desmit&rsquo;s work: The Psychology of Totalitarianism.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief, for Wednesday, February 22nd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2023/02/21/retailers-to-shut-down-over-800-big-box-stores-as-inflation-anemic-sales-and-interest-rates-create-perfect-storm-n706431"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2023/02/21/retailers-to-shut-down-over-800-big-box-stores-as-inflation-anemic-sales-and-interest-rates-create-perfect-storm-n706431</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers to Shut Down Over 800 Big-Box Stores as Inflation, Anemic Sales and Interest Rates Create Perfect Storm</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retail world continues its downward spiral, as holiday sales failed to meet expectations and wary consumers are keeping their wallets in their pockets due to rampant inflation and soaring interest rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2022 Christmas holiday sales did increase from the prior year; it&rsquo;s just that expectations were primed for an even higher increase after two years of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result: over 800 big-box stores are slated to shut down across the country in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Walmart, Gap, and Party City are among the big names who will be downsizing. Bath &amp; Beyond, which narrowly escaped bankruptcy proceedings earlier this month, is the biggest loser, aiming to cut its number of stores to 480 when it once had over 1,500 locations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 416 stores have been identified for closure, along with all 65 of its locations in Canada. Thirty-five will close in California alone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up is homegoods outlet Tuesday Morning, which will close 265 stores as it struggles to survive through bankruptcy proceedings. Once again, California will be hardest hit, with 30 stores shutting their doors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macy&rsquo;s, Big Lots, JCPenny, and even Amazon Fresh grocery stores also have plans to shutter locations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&rsquo;s going on here? CNBC explains:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For retailers, the shopping season&rsquo;s results reflect the challenges ahead. As Americans continue to pay higher prices for groceries, housing and more month after month, they are racking up credit card balances, spending down savings and having fewer dollars for discretionary spending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, retailers are following years of extraordinary spending. During the Covid pandemic, Americans fought boredom and used stimulus checks by buying loungewear, throw pillows, kitchen supplies, home theater systems and more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Party City, the ubiquitous entertainment supply chain, has filed for bankruptcy and is in the process of auctioning off many of its leases. NJBIZ reports:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Party City Holdco Inc. is looking to shrink its retail footprint as part of an expedited financial restructuring.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Feb. 16 filing with U.S. bankruptcy court, the Woodcliff Lake-based operator of 800-plus stores said it is working with A&amp;G Real Estate Partners to auction off leases for 12 underperforming locations in six states. In coming weeks, additional lease auctions will follow, with the total number of closures depending on the outcome of ongoing negotiations with landlords, according to A&amp;G.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, this is not a new trend. CVS, Rite-Aid, Kroger, Nordstrom, and Best Buy have also been quietly culling their stores over the last several years. Another factor: many locations are closing simply because they&rsquo;re not safe to operate as lax laws and woke prosecutors have turned many spots into virtual free-for-alls for organized shoplifters.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol now begs for help to stop 800% surge of migrants sneaking in from Canada</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Border Patrol is begging agents to volunteer in the north after a staggering nearly-850% surge of mostly-Mexican migrants illegally crossing into the US from Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency&rsquo;s Swanton Sector in Vermont &mdash; covering parts of upstate New York and New Hampshire &mdash; requested a &ldquo;quick turnaround&rdquo; of agents from the already overwhelmed southern border to make their way north to volunteer for at least a month starting next week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help is needed to control the &ldquo;strain caused by the surge&rdquo; of &ldquo;primarily Mexican migrants with no legal documents,&rdquo; Swanton&rsquo;s Chief Patrol Agent Robert Garcia wrote in a memo obtained this week by Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Due to the increased numbers, stations are task saturated with processing large groups, which has contributed&rdquo; to more migrants being able to slip into the country, the memo notes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The request came a week after Garcia reported that crossings had reached &ldquo;historic highs&rdquo; &mdash; even as temperatures plummet to deadly lows of minus-four degrees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His sector said that the current fiscal year &mdash; which started in October &mdash; &ldquo;demonstrates an approximate 846% increase in encounters and apprehensions compared to the same period&rdquo; in the previous year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the first four months of the current fiscal year have seen more encounters than the whole of the previous two years combined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, agents recorded 367 apprehensions and encounters &mdash; more than the total of the past 12 Januarys combined, which was 344.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desperate conditions in the south have also seen a steady flow of agents transferred there from the north, creating part of the &ldquo;vulnerability,&rdquo; Clem said</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He blamed electronic travel authorization for allowing migrants to travel &ldquo;basically visa-free&rdquo; from Mexico to Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Swanton sector has seen families with young kids, even infants, crossing, and late last year provided life-saving aid in separate incidents in Vermont and upstate New York, Garcia said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Lemon to undergo 'formal training' after sexist remarks about Nikki Haley, will be back on CNN Wednesday</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Lemon is set to return to the air on Wednesday after beign removed from CNN This Morning over sexist comments he made about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley's age.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1626263301758898176"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1626263301758898176</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longtime host will reportedly be taking part in "formal training" to help him understand why what he said was wrong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Brian Stelter, CNN CEO Chris Licht sent a memo to staff on Monday outlining the situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemon said in a tweet: The reference I made to a woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;prime&rdquo; this morning was inartful and irrelevant, as colleagues and loved ones have pointed out, and I regret it. A woman&rsquo;s age doesn't define her either personally or professionally. I have countless women in my life who prove that every day.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Veritas HEMORRHAGES Twitter followers after release of founder James O'Keefe</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Project Veritas lost over 80,000 followers on social media after it was announced company founder James O'Keefe was removed from the organization, which he founded in 2011, after the board placed him on paid leave earlier in February.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Social Blade, a social media analytics website, the live tally as of 4:30 pm showed Project Veritas had lost almost 80,000 followers on Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since February 16, on YouTube, Project Veritas has lost over 10,000 followers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A February 6 memo leaked from 16 Project Veritas employees detailed their problems with the news organization's founder and claimed he exhibited "cruel behavior."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"James has become a power drunk tyrant and he is exactly who he pontificates on who we should be exposing," wrote one of the employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial reporting on Monday from Neil McCabe of OAN claimed O'Keefe had resigned. Later, RC Maxwell from Project Veritas said O'Keefe was in fact removed from his role as CEO by the Board.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Sabbath rest is a biblical principle that seems to invite a level of controversy: how often, when, who, and in what ways are is the Sabbath to be observed.

   <title><![CDATA[Having Two Legs: Theonomy & Classical Reformed Christian Nationalism: A Modest Proposal [Pastor Toby’s Blog]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/3fd9e97d-1f11-4276-b95c-eb0e45b8bcef/having-two-legs-theonomy-classical-reformed-christian-nationalism-a-modest-proposal.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>&nbsp;Theonomy &amp; Classical Reformed Christian Nationalism: A Modest Proposal</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation swirling around Christian Nationalism, the classical liberal order, and how Christians ought to think about particular policy proposals continues apace. These issues are in play with the current push for &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; and Education Savings Accounts, and they are in play with Senator Josh Hawley&rsquo;s recent proposal to ban social media use for children under 16.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To which I tweeted out: &ldquo;Yikes. No. This is the kind of folly that conservatives propose in the name of "the common good" that gives me the creeping fantods. This is why Kuyper's sphere sovereignty and old fashioned theonomy are so necessary. God has not established the state/power of the sword to raise/train our children. Same goes for alcohol, tobacco, and firearms. As soon as you start letting the civil magistrate act like your mom, you will only get more of the Karen State that we currently have.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that seems to have stirred the waters. At this point, I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ve stirred the waters of Bethsaida and not something more shark infested, but that remains to be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the fun of the last few weeks was the honor of having Timon Cline on CrossPolitic, and we had a great time debating and discussing the differences between theonomy and what I think he and others would call classical reformed political theology &ndash; although I&rsquo;m still not convinced that they are that far apart. Meanwhile, other conversations have continued behind the scenes with friendly critics of theonomy. And then we had the follow up honor of talking to David Bahnsen about his misgivings surrounding the &ldquo;Christian Nationalism&rdquo; conversation and his preference for the &ldquo;classical liberal order.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some related factors are that sometimes advocates of &ldquo;classical liberal order&rdquo; *sound* a bit cavalier about our current cultural moment, and some, like David French, seem to have sold the whole farm to the leftists in the name of his version of the &ldquo;classical liberal order&rdquo; which seems to be code for &ldquo;surrendering slowly.&rdquo; But David Bahnsen insists that is not at all what he means or thinks. He envisions an explicitly Christian public square, but he is concerned not to make the civil sphere the central or primary actor in such an endeavor. The role of the Church and the family also need to be reinvigorated and reinforced, otherwise, you have a semi-conservative version of the current regime. And to his credit, there are some in the Reformed Christian Nationalism conversation that think it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable for Josh Hawley to propose age limits for social media, and others have suggested taking over the public schools and turning them into explicitly Christian schools funded by tax dollars and run by departments of education. All of which, I repeat, gives me the creeping fantods.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warm Theonomic Fuzzies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old Puritans and Scottish Presbyterians and Genevans who first sought reinvigorate civil magistrates under the spell of Papist supremacy (hence the name &ldquo;magisterial&rdquo; Reformers) affirmed that the specific civil laws of old Israel had expired with that particular state, except for the &ldquo;general equity thereof.&rdquo; While many modern Reformed types have concluded that this means something akin to &ldquo;cute metaphors and warm fuzzy feelings,&rdquo; the actual authors of the Westminster Confession and their immediate heirs functioned as though the Old Testament civil laws had a lot more to teach us than that. The fact that the early American colonies had Sabbath civil laws and blasphemy laws and laws prohibiting sodomy and adultery and fornication and divorce, tell you that they understood &ldquo;general equity&rdquo; as including the eternal moral and ethical principles resident in those civil laws and penalties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now first off I want to emphasize that I think we need to have this conversation. And by &ldquo;this conversation,&rdquo; I mean, I think we need to have those of you steeped in the Reformed political tradition talking with those of us who are more steeped in the biblical studies and theonomy. Some of us need to be reading Franciscus Junius and some us need to be reading Rushdoony. I really appreciated the olive branch of sorts from Stephen Wolfe on this topic (his article on &ldquo;Classical Reformed Theonomy&rdquo;), and I also really appreciated Bahnsen&rsquo;s demeanor toward the whole thing as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look, we&rsquo;ve got men in lingerie twerking in front of little kids in public parks and libraries; I think this is the moment for us to work together, not splinter into a million pieces because we didn&rsquo;t get exactly what we wanted. So first, off, I want to issue a general invite to anyone interested in recovering a truly Christian America to join the conversation in good faith. The leftist progressives rally around their common hatred of our Lord and His people, and they are frequently able to get more done together because of that shared hatred than conservatives because we throw elbows and knife one another in the back in the name of truth and morality and justice. Look, if you want to see drag queens banned from the public square, and our nation submit to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, you are most welcome to the table, even if our philosophical categories and methodologies are different. Let&rsquo;s talk. Let&rsquo;s work together. Let&rsquo;s spar, debate, and brainstorm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Chastened Classical Reformed Theonomy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And toward that end, I want to propose one way of pushing the conversation forward. One trusted and friendly critic of theonomy lamented theonomy because biblical law, he said, simply doesn&rsquo;t have enough substance to fill out a complete law code or public policy system. And I don&rsquo;t have any problem acknowledging that we need more than what is written in Scripture. As the Westminster Confession says, &ldquo;Nevertheless we acknowledge&hellip; that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and the government of the church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed&rdquo; (WCF 1.6). While this is primarily addressing the worship of God and the government of the church, I would argue that those activities that are &ldquo;common to human actions and societies&rdquo; would include the rational ordering of public policy and civil government, and therefore, those arrangements are to be &ldquo;according to the general rules of the Word,&rdquo; but must also &ldquo;be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here&rsquo;s a practical question for my &ldquo;classical Reformed&rdquo; brothers: Since I believe that we agree that wherever Scripture establishes transcendent morality or universal principles of justice, those principles are universally binding on all societies and governments, regardless of time or place, can we agree that since we are Reformed and Protestant, those principles are &ldquo;First Principles?&rdquo; In other words, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sola Scriptura</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (understood rightly) applies here as much as anywhere else. Sola Scriptura does not mean that Scripture is the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authority, but rather, it means that Scripture is the only ultimate and infallible authority. Tradition, creeds, common law, parents, and pastors all play true authoritative roles in the life of Christians and Christian society. Nevertheless, the First Principles of Scripture are foundational, and wherever any other true authority bumps up against one of them, Scripture always wins. Are we on the same page so far?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now here&rsquo;s the proposal: I propose that we agree that wherever Scripture speaks on matters of universal morality and justice, those principles be nailed into the ground with enormous steel stakes (yuge ones). At that point, I would be happy to concede that all by itself, those general principles of justice are not enough to build out a modern civil law code, but since we are Protestants, we are agreed that whatever else ought to go into that law code, it must be deduced from those principles by good and necessary consequence, according to the light of nature and reason, and be consistent with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this might be where I run into trouble with critics of theonomy, but as a fiercely loyal Protestant, I also want to insist on a sort of regulative principle of power. Since all power is derived from God (Rom. 13), all power is wielded by His blessing and in submission to His ultimate power or else it is wielded in defiance of His blessing and power. Furthermore, this fits with what the Confession says regarding worship, that what is clearly stated must be explicitly obeyed, and whatever else is necessary for a flourishing society must be deduced from those principles and the light of nature. This need not be taken as tight-shoed regulative principle, but simply, as my old seminary professor, Hughes Oliphant Old, like to say, it must be &ldquo;according to Scripture,&rdquo; obedient to the commands and consistent with its principles and examples.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Few Stakes in the Ground</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What follows is certainly not an exhaustive list, but this will do for a start.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, while I do believe that civil government was instituted before the Fall and would have developed as families filled the earth, organizing society with a body of customary laws to maximize their good (deciding which side of the road to drive on, for example), the primary postlapsarian instruction and picture we are given of civil justice in the Bible captured well in the paintings and statues of Lady Justice: she is blind (or blindfolded), holding balances in one hand, and a sword in the other. This accords with the repeated instructions to the judges, &ldquo;Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; (Dt. 1:17). Justice requires diligent inquiry, but that inquiry is primarily for the purpose of putting all the facts in the scales of justice. While justice requires wisdom, it is not primarily a &ldquo;creative&rdquo; task. The judgment of justice is God&rsquo;s. Diligent inquiry puts all the facts that we have in the scales, and it is the job of civil magistrates to deliver verdicts of equity, which is primarily punitive (as indicated by the sword).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when I said that Josh Hawley ought not be leading the way in banning teenagers from social media since that is family/parental jurisdiction, some friends pointed out that the Bible on one occasion refers to magistrates as nursing fathers and mothers (Is. 49:23). And so it does. But that one image (which we should not abandon) cannot be made the normative image without doing great damage to the rest of Scripture. The key question of course is: how are civil magistrates to be faithful fathers and mothers? The answer is: by doing justice according to God&rsquo;s law. Isaiah 49:23 is no more a defense of Social Security, Medicare, and government schools than is Paul&rsquo;s description of himself as a father default permission for him to tell parents which breakfast cereal is right for their kids. The church is the household and family of God, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the church is the first line of defense for widows. Paul insists that a man that doesn&rsquo;t provide for his own family is worse than an unbeliever (1 Tim. 5:7). These natural affections, natural obligations remain firmly in place, including then the fact that the civil magistrate has no role in health, welfare, and education, unless you simply mean the role of punishing criminals and cheering churches and families on in their tasks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another stake to drive into the ground is the most basic principle of biblical justice: the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">lex talionis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &ldquo;Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe&rdquo; (Ex. 21:24-25). A number of case laws are laid out in the biblical law that give is a lot of information about how this principle is to play out (e.g. slaves that are struck and lose an eye or tooth must be set free). Related is the principle of restitution: a thief caught stealing must return double (Ex. 22:4). Because what he sought to do his neighbor ought to be done to him to restore balance to the scales of society. If the theft is of a particularly great value, perhaps including the ability of a man/business to do his productive labor, or if the stolen item has been sold for profit that restitution may be increased to four or five-fold (Ex. 22:1).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The penalties in the Mosaic law should also be taken seriously, and they should be understood as maximum penalties. The only required death penalty is for murder (Gen. 9). Related to this is the principle that only civil magistrates have the power of the sword, and so church and family government may not execute criminals or heretics. This is part of the glory of Dt. 21:18-19 regarding the rebellious son. In some ancient societies, a father claimed the right to execute his own children, but God&rsquo;s law forbids it. Perhaps a pagan father might have even argued &ldquo;from nature&rdquo; that since he had brought the life into the world, it was his to adjudicate, but God&rsquo;s law prohibits it. The law provides that the family government may appeal to the civil government for adjudication and potential capital punishment. But notice that until an actual crime has been committed, the civil magistrate has no jurisdiction, and the civil magistrate is only involved upon appeal from the family government. This would be one such biblical principle that would render Sen. Hawley&rsquo;s proposed social media legislation null and void.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most often cited laws in the Old Testament for explaining the continuing relevance or &ldquo;general equity&rdquo; of Mosaic law is Dt. 22:8: &ldquo;When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.&rdquo; On the one hand, this certainly is an extension of the sixth commandment forbidding murder, and it certainly establishes the notion of liability for negligent homicide or battery. The general equity of this law would be rightly applied to people who refuse to put a fence around their swimming pool or a deep pit or their upstairs balcony (and arguably, reckless driving): if someone falls and dies or is injured, the home owner/driver can be held negligently liable. And the overarching principle is certainly the duty of all to take reasonable precautions to protect and preserve life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, some want to reason from this principle that health and building codes are therefore a reasonable application of this justice. But while it would certainly be a &ldquo;sin&rdquo; to act in high-handed negligent ways, it was not a &ldquo;crime.&rdquo; The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">lex talionis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> principle requires that actual harm be measured for appropriate penalties to be exacted. But if a man built a balcony and refused to build a railing or drove recklessly through town, he may very well be in sin, but until actual damages have occurred, what penalty would truly be &ldquo;eye for eye?&rdquo; We also shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the power and influence of the family and church governments and their related communities. Not every problem must be solved with guns and fines. Many problems should be solved by community pressures and influence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fear of the classical reformed Christian Nationalist types is that &ldquo;the classical liberal order&rdquo; is code for more liberalism, more false offers of a seat at the table of a neutral public square, and defeatism and apathy, but let us be done with all offers of neutrality, secularism, and the like.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus is Lord of the public square, and the Great Commission requires us to preach and make disciples of all the nations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So America must confess that Jesus is Lord formally, and our laws must reflect is eternal law, as derived from Scripture and nature and reason, but with Scripture firmly ensconced as the Chief authority.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, my friends of the theonomic Kuyperian classical order flavor are understandably nervous that if we do not firmly root our &ldquo;Christian order&rdquo; in Rutherford&rsquo;s axiom, that the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lex</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> really is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rex</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and that justice and the &ldquo;common good&rdquo; must be grounded in God&rsquo;s Special Revelation in Scripture, then in the name of &ldquo;the tradition&rdquo; and &ldquo;the common good&rdquo; and &ldquo;reason&rdquo; and the &ldquo;light of nature&rdquo; we will end up right back where are, a Machiavellian power grab that happens to have Christian symbols and phrases attached to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's true that the &ldquo;classical liberal order&rdquo; guys sometimes sound like power is only icky and bad, but in our determination to take responsibility for this mess of country, we must have clearly defined limits to that power. And it&rsquo;s also true that sometimes the Christian Nationalists sound like they would be willing to do anything to punch the liberals and score points. But tyranny is still tyranny even you try to defend it in the name of &ldquo;the common good.&rdquo; The &ldquo;common good&rdquo; is whatever God says it is, and nothing else. And if God has given the authority and power to wield, then we should not be afraid of it. We should take it up with boldness and joy in the name of Christ.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turkey hit by two more powerful earthquakes two weeks after disaster</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 6.4-magnitude earthquake and a second measuring 5.8 have hit Turkey&rsquo;s southern province of Hatay, terrifying those left in a region devastated by twin earthquakes two weeks ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turkey&rsquo;s interior minister, S&uuml;leyman Soylu, said that at least three people were killed and 213 wounded by the latest quakes, after a large government hospital in the city of İskenderun in the north of Hatay province declared it was evacuating patients.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest quakes, less powerful than the 7.8- and 7.5-magnitude earthquakes that tore a path of destruction through southern Turkey and northern Syria on 6 February, threaten yet more devastation in a region where many people have fled their destroyed homes for the safety of other towns and villages outside the quake zone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The larger quake struck at a depth of just 2km (1.2 miles), the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said, potentially magnifying its impact at ground level. It was centred near the southern Turkish city of Antakya and was felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turkey&rsquo;s disaster management agency AFAD said the epicentre of the larger quake was below the Defne district of Hatay, in a region where many have complained of a lacklustre government response to the first earthquakes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll in Turkey from the quakes two weeks ago rose to 41,156 on Monday, AFAD said, and was expected to climb further, with 385,000 apartments known to have been destroyed or seriously damaged and many people still missing. At least 47,000 people are estimated to have died across Turkey and Syria.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Turkish president, said construction work on nearly 200,000 apartments in 11 earthquake-hit provinces of Turkey would begin next month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hours earlier, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on a visit to Turkey that Washington would help &ldquo;for as long as it takes&rdquo; as rescue operations and aftershocks were winding down and the focus turned towards urgent shelter and reconstruction work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In rebel-held Syria, local search and rescue services and the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, reported the latest earthquakes had damaged buildings across a number of cities and towns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said people had been injured by falling debris and stampedes, as well as jumping from elevated positions in fear of the destruction.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China Considering &lsquo;Lethal&rsquo; Aid for Russia: Blinken</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese regime could be considering providing lethal aid to Russia, according to U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, which, if confirmed, would represent an unprecedented escalation of China&rsquo;s presence in the Russia-Ukraine war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[F]or the most part, China has been engaged in providing rhetorical, political, diplomatic support to Russia. But we have information that gives us concern that they are considering providing lethal support to Russia in the war against Ukraine,&rdquo; Blinken told ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; program on Sunday, after meeting with China&rsquo;s top diplomat, Wang Yi, at the Munich Security Conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang spoke at the conference on Feb. 18 and said the Chinese regime is working on a &ldquo;peace proposal&rdquo; to reconcile the two sides of the conflict. Blinken indicated that the stipulated intention appears to run contrary to what is indicated in intelligence held by the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang and Blinken&rsquo;s meeting marked the first face-to-face exchange between the two sides since the surveillance balloon incident that set off an uproar in the United States and forced Blinken to cancel a planned visit to Beijing, bringing the relationship between the leader of the liberal democratic world and the leader of authoritarian governments to a freezing point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hours before the meeting, Wang described the U.S. shootdown of the Chinese spy balloon that enter U.S. airspace without permission as &ldquo;hysterical,&rdquo; &ldquo;unimaginable,&rdquo; and a violation of international norms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese regime insists that the spy balloon is a weather balloon intended mainly for research purposes; the United States rejects this contention saying that it detected other equipment onboard and downed the spy balloon with an F-22 fighter jet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement following the U.S.-China exchange in Germany, China&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it does not &ldquo;accept the U.S.&rsquo;s finger-pointing or even coercion targeting China-Russia relations&rdquo; and, regarding the balloon incidence, threatened that the United States &ldquo;should be prepared to bear all consequence arising from an escalation.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaked letter details James O'Keefe's response following indefinite no-pay suspension from Project Veritas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leaked letter exclusively obtained by The Post Millennial reveals Project Veritas' founder James O'Keefe's statement to staffers on Monday after he was effectively removed from the organization by the board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter includes screenshots of the board's meeting on Feb. 10 in which they voted three-to-two for his "indefinite suspension as CEO without compensation" pending an "audit."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v2a7mig-james-okeefe-to-pv-staff-ive-been-removed-from-ceo-and-board.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v2a7mig-:james-okeefe-to-pv-staff-ive-been-removed-from-ceo-and-board.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video - Play 16:50-18:22</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear if O'Keefe will resign from Project Veritas or be fired, though Project Veritas spokesman RC Maxwell said in a statement to TPM: "I unfortunately don&rsquo;t have any answers for you, the Project Veritas board is in charge now." O'Keefe declined to comment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPM understands that the board of directors plan to have a meeting and vote on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Project Veritas staffers had made allegations to the board that O'Keefe's curt leadership style was offensive to staff and donors. One large allegation of him being rude to a "high-net-worth" Oregon donor couple was refuted by the couple itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1624529211544244224"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1624529211544244224</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O'Keefe's 4,600-word letter to staffers details the emotional turmoil he and the organization have experienced in the 13 years since its founding from his parent's carriage house in New Jersey. They include what he believes are years of lawfare and corrupt criminal investigations aimed at stopping his organization from exposing powerful individuals and organizations. He also concedes to the staffers' main grievances about his leadership style.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I haven't always been the most ostensibly compassionate leader - and that is admittedly a fault, something I need to work on," he wrote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since being suspended by the board, supporters of O'Keefe have speculated about the timing given that only days earlier Project Veritas had broken the most-viewed story in its history about a Pfizer executive who said that the pharmaceutical company worked on mutating the Covid-19 virus. O'Keefe references this in his letter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&rsquo;Keefe&rsquo;s letter also includes a screenshot of an alleged text message conversation between an unnamed board member and a Project Veritas staffer discussing getting a raise if O&rsquo;Keefe is removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O'Keefe continues sharing his side of the internal dispute and closes the letter by suggesting he is prepared to start a new organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"So our mission continues on &mdash; I'm not done. The mission will perhaps take on a new name, and it may no longer be called Project Veritas. I'll need a bunch of people around me and I will make sure sure you know how to find me."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;&rsquo;</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/woke-california-university-slammed-dehumanized-initiative-encouraging-students-tell-professors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/woke-california-university-slammed-dehumanized-initiative-encouraging-students-tell-professors</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Woke' California university slammed for 'dehumanized' initiative encouraging students to tell on professors</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College students are pushing back against a "woke" California university for encouraging students to tell on professors for racism if they aren't called on "consistently" during class.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Reform correspondents Courtney McLain, Emily Sturge, and Darryl Boyer joined "Fox &amp; Friends Weekend" to discuss the broader issues at hand with the far-left infusion of the "woke" agenda in college classrooms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California State University Monterey Bay has faced criticism for urging non-White students to report "race-related stress" under the Personal Growth and Counseling Center tab on its website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Document acts of racism or intolerance. Don't ignore or minimize your experiences, and think broadly about what could be an act of racism. It doesn't have to be an overt act (e.g., professor consistently not calling on you or minimizing your contributions, curriculum racially biased, etc). Talk to someone you trust, and report it," a webpage on "Coping with Racism and Discrimination" says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the university website, race-related stress can cause psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia, and self-blame, as well as physiological health concerns such as heart disease, hypertension, and muscle tension.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McLain, who is a student at University of Central Florida, noted her angst surrounding the move, citing concerns as to how it affects academic progress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am seeing more and more of this diversity, equity and inclusion being forced by my school, and I'm frustrated because I feel like I'm not learning as much academically as I could because we're putting so much money into this," McLain said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the widespread effort of the far left, the trio touted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis,' R., efforts to counter indoctrination in the state's classrooms.</span></p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/e903a7be-958f-408e-81d6-0d3f8b158fb3/having-two-legs-tucker-carlson-a-case-study-in-christian-nationalism-theocratic-conservatism.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tucker Carlson &amp; A Case Study in Christian Nationalism &amp; Theocratic Conservatism&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One may wonder how the algorithmic gods of the medias mutter and chirp and old clips of Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro emerge from the ancient shadows, but be assured that they do and when they do, they provide one with opportunities to pull your son aside, like Solomon in Proverbs and say, do you see that man? Yeah, not like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the particular clip that is currently making the rounds is from 2018, and a great deal of water has gone under the old proverbial bridge and has flowed many miles hence, even to the wild lands of Wuhan and beyond. And so one might hope that greater light has come into the great Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s eyes. I mean, if they can lock us down, close our churches, foist useless, perhaps even harmful masks on our faces, and demand injections or else you&rsquo;re a hater, a bigot, and a scoundrel, perhaps he&rsquo;s had a change of heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the clip is from when a Ben Shapiro interview of Tucker Carlson, where Tucker argues that since family is the foundational building block of society and an unmitigated good, society ought to take steps to protect it and defend it. And certain technological advances that threaten that good ought to be curbed and perhaps even prohibited. Tucker says that if we don&rsquo;t we may very soon end up with a situation where a reasonably well-adjusted college graduate (one who doesn&rsquo;t smoke pot) may not have the means to provide for himself, much less take a wife, and raise a family with her. And when pressed by Ben Shapiro about the possibility of Artificial Intelligence driving trucks on American highways, Tucker says that if he was President he would absolutely order the Department of Transportation to ban all AI on federal highways because if they didn&rsquo;t millions of jobs would be lost. And truck driving is one of the most common jobs for high school educated men in America.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Setting the Table</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let&rsquo;s set the table carefully here. First, it&rsquo;s absolutely true that the natural family is the foundational building block of society. Second, let&rsquo;s agree that society should do everything lawfully in its power to protect and encourage family formation and flourishing. But here is where the questions begin to array themselves. What actually is &ldquo;lawfully in its power?&rdquo; Can the state simply do anything that appears to contribute to some notion of the &ldquo;common good?&rdquo; How should society protect and encourage natural family formation? My previously stated proposal is that as Protestant Christians we must begin with the clear instructions given in Scripture and then work our way out from those by good and necessary consequence, by the light of nature and Christian prudence. So I don&rsquo;t think we need an explicit Bible verse about AI and truck drivers, but I do think we need clear-eyed biblical principles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple problems with Tucker&rsquo;s proposal, beginning with him acting like a socialist. The assumption of socialism/Marxism is that there is no God, and therefore the state must take His place. Since there is no God to do justice, rendering unto each man what he deserves, the State takes unto itself this responsibility. Fascism need not be dark and bloody at first. It simply claims the right to command commerce and markets for the &ldquo;common good&rdquo; of society, for the good of families and family values. But it&rsquo;s still fascism and socialism for all that, even if the state is commanding Bible reading and church attendance. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand: I&rsquo;m not saying that Tucker&rsquo;s second presidential fiat would be compulsory Bible reading and church attendance. But why exactly not?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, these soft-socialist/fascist policies claim a kind omniscience. Tucker claims that millions of jobs will be lost in a matter of years. But this sounds like the conservative equivalent of the environmental doomsdayers. If you don&rsquo;t ban plastic bags today, the oceans will rise in five years and millions will die! Or sometimes they even notice real problems, like for example, air pollution. But as Alex Epstein has helpfully catalogued, over and over again, there&rsquo;s a certain simplistic and narrow mindset that looks at one factor and multiplies it by a million without accounting for all the other possibilities and concludes that the apocalyptic outcome is inevitable! And that&rsquo;s trying to be god while sucking at it. So when environmentalists have projected air pollution from coal and oil and other fossil fuels, what they have consistently not accounted for is adaptation, creativity, ingenuity, and improvements in technology which mitigate, minimize, and sometimes completely undo the dangers and potential harms. People, made in the image of God, are like God, and despite our fallen natures, they are generally trying to improve things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tucker&rsquo;s comments struck me as not only tapping into that false socialist omniscience, but they were demeaning and condescending to the very human beings he was claiming to want to protect and help, while apparently completely forgetting about other human beings in the equation. Now, it&rsquo;s an entirely open question as to whether it would ever actually work to have AI drive trucks in this country. At the very least, we would want to have a chain of liability clearly articulated, and like the goring ox in Exodus 21, require restitution and harsh penalties for any harm or damage that occurs. But why does Tucker paint the drug free college graduate like a helpless victim? Why are working class high school graduates being described as completely dependent on truck driving jobs? Can they not do anything else? A few decades ago they worked in American factories, but after the government got involved in &ldquo;helping&rdquo; them, they all got sent overseas. And here we are suggesting more Big Government involvement to help &ldquo;fix&rdquo; inequities. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the government and we&rsquo;re here to help,&rdquo; are still the most terrifying words in the English language, even when they are in the mouth of so-called &ldquo;common good&rdquo; conservatives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the fact of the matter is that even if the tech and liabilities all got sufficiently sorted, and people started experimenting with AI truck drivers, the change wouldn&rsquo;t happen overnight. But as it started to happen (if it ever did), you would immediately be funding all the developers, troubleshooters, repairment, maintenance, and updates needed to grow and improve that new technology. The other part of the &ldquo;inevitability-omniscience&rdquo; complex is a failure to see that new technology only ever depends upon human beings creating it, maintaining, fixing it, improving, and so on. Read </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life After Google</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by George Gilder and repent of your implicit Darwinism. Artificial intelligence will always be completely dependent upon human intelligence. So just as a new technology begins to break into markets, new human jobs come into being. And this is how it has always worked. As technology changes, some folks are laid off and find new creative outlets, but all of that new technology also always creates new needs for human workers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Biblical Common Good</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biblical vision of the common good is each sphere of government exercising the power delegated to it by Christ obediently. The Magisterial Reformers were working in a particular historical moment where church government had way overreached its bounds, and part of the way you begin to limit overweening powers is by reinvigorating the balance of powers. In the days of Luther and Calvin it was absolutely necessary to call the magistrates to take up the sword of justice and push back the encroachments of the Papal See. However, we now live in an era where the state has become the Infallible Mouth of God, and it&rsquo;s high time ministers of the gospel declared the Lordship of Christ and commanded magistrates back into their own lane, while insisting that husbands and fathers, wives and mothers step up to the plate and take back their authority in the home and marketplace. Until a crime has been actually committed, it is an unjust use of violence to manipulate markets. I understand that when you live in a snake pit of market regulations the temptation is to simply join the mafia and release your own &ldquo;good&rdquo; snakes into the mix, but as we learn from one of those lesser known Mosaic principles, never bring more snakes to a snake pit unless your snake will swallow all of them and turn back into a walking stick when it&rsquo;s done.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">God has established three governments among men: the family, the church, and the state. These governments are not water-tight jurisdictions, but function more like a Venn diagram with clear differences and some overlap. God has assigned to the family the jurisdiction of health, welfare, and education. God has assigned to the church the ministry of worship and discipleship, the administration of Word and sacrament. God has assigned to the state the ministry of the sword of justice. Closely related is the difference between sins and crimes. We see this distinction beginning in the differing ministries of Abraham and Melchizedek, Moses and Aaron, as well as the differing penalties provided in the Mosaic law. When the law says that someone will be &ldquo;cut off from among his people,&rdquo; this is the ordinary discipline of Old Testament family and &ldquo;church.&rdquo; When the penalty prescribed is restitution or stripes or death, this the ministry of the sword. Now granted these are not pristine, Euclidian categories. Many of the laws in the Mosaic code have moral, ceremonial, and civil elements to them. Nevertheless, ceremonial laws were under the jurisdiction of the priests and civil laws were under the jurisdiction of the judges and magistrates. But the fact that family law was also being established in the Mosaic law is profound. Laws surrounding marriage and divorce and remarriage within families, with instructions for what might be appealed to civil magistrates for civil penalties begin to establish these jurisdictional differences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, not all sins are or should be crimes. Covetousness is a sin but not a crime. Lying is always a sin, but not all lies should be adjudicated as crimes. Lust is a sin, even adultery in the heart, but until the lust is acted upon in fornication or adultery, there is no crime to adjudicate. A rebellious son ought to be disciplined by his own parents for many years before they determine to appeal to the civil magistrate for criminal penalties. But here is where the jurisdictions overlap: if a true biblical crime has been committed in a family or church, the civil magistrate is authorized by God to intervene. A civil magistrate my seek a warrant to arrest a father and pastor for sexual abuse. But by the same token, a father may resist or ignore tyrannical orders given a magistrate and a pastor may rebuke a magistrate and command him to repent of his sin, just as John did and lost his head for it. When a church excommunicates a professing Christian, barring them from the Lord&rsquo;s Supper and fellowship in the local church, the church is exercising its power to protect truth and morality in a society. When a family disciplines its young children teaching them Christian virtues the family government is doing its part to cultivate families and work ethics and morality. The family has the power to ultimately disinherit a son or daughter for gross immorality or apostasy. And it is the job of the state to punish crimes as defined by Scripture. No crime has been committed if a trucking company fires a driver in favor of an AI driver.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the clip mentioned, Tucker Carlson says that even though he believes in free markets it&rsquo;s not an absolute or religious commitment or requirement. He says there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;Nicene Creed of Capitalism&rdquo; he has to subscribe to. Now he&rsquo;s absolutely right if he means that free markets may not be used to justify committing crimes (e.g. theft, murder, etc.). But what Tucker is actually proposing is denying jobs and livelihoods to those working in AI, and by the making it a law, he&rsquo;s threatening the use of violence for those who try. In the name of doing good and protecting families, Tucker is proposing that he be the one who gets to choose the winners and the losers. Truckers are the winners; programmers and new tech are the losers. Sorry, the gods have spoken. We know what&rsquo;s best for you. And actually, we&rsquo;ve decided that cars have taken too many jobs away from horses and mules. So yeah, we&rsquo;re going back to the Middle Ages, you greedy capitalist pigs. But seriously, where&rsquo;s the line?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, I&rsquo;ll stop here. Tucker says there&rsquo;s no Nicene Creed of capitalism, and that&rsquo;s true enough, but there is a Nicene Creed that says that God is the &ldquo;Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible&hellip;&rdquo; Invisible things would include market forces, the creativity and ingenuity of men, as well as their created needs and desires.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until or unless God gives a government the authority to step in, it is a violation of the Nicene Creed to grasp power for yourself and violently or coercively prohibit the free actions and creativity of people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must always be remembered that if the primary power of the state is the power of the sword, then whenever you call for a &ldquo;ban,&rdquo; you are simultaneously calling for the use of violent, coercive force to be used if someone disregards the ban. I&rsquo;m sorry, but we just had a few years of a police state trial run in the West with law enforcement fining churches for being open, for mandated gags on peoples&rsquo; faces, and frog marching decent law-abiding citizens off to jail for singing songs in public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do believe in the &ldquo;common good,&rdquo; but the common good is determined by God&rsquo;s Word and not simplistic, short-sighted calculations. It was those kinds of simplistic, short-sighted calculations that the Imperial College of London used to insight the COVID panic. So, no thanks. God&rsquo;s world is more resilient, more complex, more glorious than that.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Guess what, Pkarlgh?&nbsp; Did you guess the Podcast Ninja (Luke McKinney) is on the mic with us today?!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pod Ninja doesn't listen to The Comedian Next Door episodes. So, sometimes we need him to sit at the table while we talk, just so he knows what we've been talking about...</p>
<p>There's CONTROVERSY! (But when isn't that the case?) It's a good thing we are part of the Fight Laugh Feast Network, where upsetting people on the internet doesn't neessarily mean the end of our career.&nbsp;<br /><br />We've upset the nurses and the LGBT mob (multiple times), and now we've got the teachers worked up.</p>
<p>John maintains the belief that children should not have access to every, single book ever written.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people tried to make the case that Song of Solomon is just as smutty as the raunchy romance novels being discovered in children's libraries--and that's HILARIOUS.</p>
<p>Later: Even good intentions can lead to disastrous outcomes when teachers try to "save" kids from their own parents.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally:&nbsp; That Hideous Strength and the Abolition of Man really are worth the hype.&nbsp; C.S. Lewis was ridiculously insightful.&nbsp; And--humans are like stringed instruments, needing to be tuned.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Friday, February 17th, 2023. I hope you all have had a fantastic week as we&rsquo;ve reached Friday!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trinity Church is hosting a Men&rsquo;s Conference, Friday night and Saturday morning, 2/24-2/25. The title is Taking Dominion. God has given mankind the commission to take dominion over His creation for the purpose of making it more fruitful, beneficial, and enjoyable, and all to the glory of God. Men are the tip of the spear as we lead our households in the pursuit of this dominion. Pastor Dave Hatcher, Pastor Jerry Owen, and Andrew Crappuchettes (CEO RedBalloon) will be speaking about fulfilling this mandate in our selves, our houses, and the other opportunities God gives us.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/train-derails-outside-detroit-michigan-one-car-hazardous-materials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/train-derails-outside-detroit-michigan-one-car-hazardous-materials</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train derails outside Detroit, Michigan, with one car carrying hazardous materials</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A train containing one car of hazardous materials has derailed Thursday in Van Buren Township outside Detroit, Michigan, reports say.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause of the derailment was not immediately clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police told Fox2 Detroit that there were no injuries and the area is not a hazmat situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials that spoke to WXYZ, which reported that at least six cars were seen off the track, said one of them was carrying hazardous materials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The derailment comes less than two weeks after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police told Fox2 Detroit that roads will be closed in the area while an investigation is ongoing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy also said it is "aware of the train derailment in Van Buren Township, Wayne County, where initial reports indicate no threat to the public from the derailment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"EGLE personnel are on their way to the scene to assist in assessing the situation," it added.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden admin turns down Ohio's request for disaster assistance after toxic derailment</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration turned down a request for federal disaster assistance from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine in the aftermath of the train derailment in the state earlier this month that led to a large release of toxic chemicals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Ohio's state government that it was not eligible for disaster assistance to help the community recover from the toxic spill, Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for DeWine, told Fox News Digital on Thursday. Tierney explained that FEMA believed the incident didn't qualify as a traditional disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, for which it usually provides assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The DeWine Administration has been in daily contact with FEMA to discuss the need for federal support, however FEMA continues to tell Governor DeWine that Ohio is not eligible for assistance at this time," DeWine's office said in a statement earlier in the day. "Governor DeWine will continue working with FEMA to determine what assistance can be provided."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA said that its team is in constant communication with DeWine's office, but didn't comment on the request for federal relief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tierney noted, though, that the governor was able to secure some health assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services that will go towards helping local residents with any medical care costs that stem from the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk Southern has offered financial compensation to locals who were displaced and has worked with the Environmental Protection Agency and state officials to conduct air safety tests. Health officials have assured the public that tests have shown the area is safe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruce Willis Diagnosed With Frontotemporal Dementia, Family Says</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, his family said in a statement Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 67-year-old &ldquo;Die Hard&rdquo; star was diagnosed with the disease, also known as FTD, after his prior diagnosis of aphasia progressed, his family said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disease&rsquo;s progression varies from two to more than 20 years and the average life expectancy after the start of symptoms is seven to 13 years. There is no cure or treatment currently available, according to the AFTD&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willis&rsquo; family said that by sharing his story they hope they can bring more awareness to the disease and push for research toward finding treatments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willis retired from acting in 2022 after his aphasia diagnosis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aphasia typically occurs suddenly after a stroke, head injury or sometimes a slow-growing tumor. It can affect a person&rsquo;s ability to speak, write and understand language, both verbal and written, according to the Mayo Clinic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actor&rsquo;s former co-workers told the Los Angeles Times last year that he had been struggling for years on set.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Biden administrations&rsquo; zeal for shooting down balloons, they may have overreacted with this one&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/aircraft-propulsion/hobby-clubs-missing-balloon-feared-shot-down-usaf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/aircraft-propulsion/hobby-clubs-missing-balloon-feared-shot-down-usaf</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobby Club&rsquo;s Missing Balloon Feared Shot Down By USAF</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small, globe-trotting balloon declared &ldquo;missing in action&rdquo; by an Illinois-based hobbyist club on Feb. 15 has emerged as a candidate to explain one of the three mystery objects shot down by four heat-seeking missiles launched by U.S. Air Force fighters since Feb. 10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The club&mdash;the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade (NIBBB)&mdash;is not pointing fingers yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the circumstantial evidence is at least intriguing. The club&rsquo;s silver-coated, party-style, &ldquo;pico balloon&rdquo; reported its last position on Feb. 10 at 38,910 ft. off the west coast of Alaska, and a popular forecasting tool&mdash;the HYSPLIT model provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&mdash;projected the cylindrically shaped object would be floating high over the central part of the Yukon Territory on Feb. 11. That is the same day a Lockheed Martin F-22 shot down an unidentified object of a similar description and altitude in the same general area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are suspicions among other prominent members of the small, pico-ballooning enthusiasts&rsquo; community, which combines ham radio and high-altitude ballooning into a single, relatively affordable hobby.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/eu-2035-gas-car-ban"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/eu-2035-gas-car-ban</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Union approves effective ban on sales of gas cars by 2035, requiring 100% reduction in CO2</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Parliament has formally approved a law that will effectively end the sale of gas- and diesel-powered vehicles in the European Union by 2035, calling for a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions for any new cars sold, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 27-nation union agreed to the changes in October 2022, but has now formalized the deal, which enforces a 55% reduction in emissions for vehicles by 2030. Levels for CO2 for 2021 were set at a target of 37.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vans will get a slight advantage in the market, requiring a a 50% cut by 2030, compared with 2021 levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few months before the announcement in May 2022, car makers such as Ford and Volvo even signed a joint letter with 26 other companies asking the European Union to implement such a plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The target of 2035 has been justified by the EU based on what officials say is an average vehicle lifespan of 15 years, which would allow the EU to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that make less than 10,000 cars per year will be able to negotiate lower targets until 2036, however some companies are happily ready to enforce the change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen vowed in October 2022 to produce only electric cars in Europe beginning in 2033, committing to the earliest possible time frame after previously stating it would aim for a 2033-2035 range.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in June 2022, five countries were looking to delay the shift to electric-only vehicles by at least five years to 2040. Bulgaria, Italy, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia called for a 90% cut of CO2 by 2035, extending the 100% target to 2040, with light commercial vehicles meeting 80% for 2035 before also needing the full cut by 2040.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bulgarian official had said that the EU needed to reconsider the economic costs of switching to electric and the effect that would have on poorer nations in the union.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laws enforcing electric vehicle chargers are currently in negotiation in the union.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist China Cracked Down On Christians In 2022</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) censored, fined, politically indoctrinated and forcibly disappeared Chinese Christians in 2022, according to a new report from the nonprofit ChinaAid Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) reportedly employed a range of new methods to persecute Chinese Christians in 2022 including fabricating charges of fraud as well as criminalizing the legal international travel of church leaders, the report states. China&rsquo;s crackdown on Christianity reportedly intensified in the run-up to the CCP&rsquo;s 20th Party Congress in October 2022, during which time General Secretary Xi Jinping secured a third term as the communist nation&rsquo;s supreme leader, according to ChinaAid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Xi Jinping and the Communist Party did all they could to silence Christians leading up to the 20th National Congress,&rdquo; Jonathan Dingler, a spokesman for ChinaAid who worked on the report, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christians account for approximately 5% of China&rsquo;s religious community, according to the CIA World Factbook. While Catholics number around 10 million, Protestants account for the majority of China&rsquo;s Christian community, with approximately 38 million followers as of 2020, The Economist reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dingler told the DCNF that after the CCP&rsquo;s crackdown leading up to the 20th Party Congress &ldquo;the tone shifted&rdquo; within the state-sanctioned churches which then began treating Xi &ldquo;as if he were the leader of the church.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChinaAid identified a March 2022 paper entitled &ldquo;Adhering to the Sinicization of Religion in China&rdquo; published by the United Front Work Department (UFWD) as the political motivation behind the CCP&rsquo;s 2022 crackdown on Christianity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UFWD is a &ldquo;Chinese government entity charged with extending the CCP&rsquo;s influence and control over non-Party organizations both domestically and abroad to advance CCP policy objectives,&rdquo; according to a 2021 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC). Moreover, the USCC also identified the UFWD as a &ldquo;Chinese intelligence service&rdquo; in 2016.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UFWD&rsquo;s March 2022 paper reportedly emphasized &ldquo;promoting the Sinicization of religion, adhering to the orientation of the core socialist values and submerging all religious beliefs in Chinese culture to better adapt religion to China&rsquo;s socialist society and the New Era of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,&rdquo; according to ChinaAid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s state-sanctioned churches must now actively promote Xi&rsquo;s thoughts &ldquo;from the pulpit,&rdquo; which in practice means that churches which don&rsquo;t &ldquo;flat-out fall at Xi&rsquo;s feet and worship him are considered &lsquo;inciting subversion of state power,'&rdquo; Dingler told the DCNF.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churches were reportedly even converted into political propaganda centers in order to broadcast Xi&rsquo;s speech during the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, according to ChinaAid&rsquo;s report. Likewise, churches in other provinces were also reportedly repurposed to hold &ldquo;study&rdquo; sessions on CCP policies such as &ldquo;Reinforcing Management of Religion on All Fronts: 10 Prohibitions and 10 Mustn&rsquo;ts.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese government also increasingly persecuted Christians online in 2022, censoring words like &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Savior&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, according to ChinaAid&rsquo;s report. At the same time, the Chinese government also shut down church websites and Christians&rsquo; social media accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Congregants can&rsquo;t even give to their churches online anymore, thanks to new regulations,&rdquo; Dingler said. &ldquo;They want to break down house churches even further, hoping they will finally give in and submit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese Embassy did not respond to the DCNF&rsquo;s request for comment.</span></p>

   <title><![CDATA[Having Two Legs: The Dignity of Guilt [Pastor Toby’s Blog]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/fb3f8628-6d3e-444d-a19e-ef6ea8588e58/having-two-legs-the-dignity-of-guilt.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dignity of Guilt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most loving and dignifying things God does for human beings is insist that they take responsibility for their sin. This is one of the fundamental meanings of the words of Christ: If anyone tries to save his life, he will lose it, but if he loses it for my sake, he will find it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world that makes excuses for everything, blames other people, circumstances, and wants to constantly play the victim, but the deep irony is that all excuse making is dehumanizing. Every time you blame someone else you sell your soul, you become less human. In our effort to save our life, our dignity, our value we actually cheapen the impact of our own choices, decisions, thoughts, words, and reactions. The end result of blaming others is that your actions don&rsquo;t matter, you don&rsquo;t matter. How could you matter? By that standard, nothing you do does anything. You were angry because of the kids. You lied because of that other person. You&rsquo;re depressed because of your dad. You snapped because you didn&rsquo;t get enough sleep or you missed breakfast. But what you&rsquo;re doing with every one of those excuses is selling your dignity as a human being, and fundamentally you are defying the God who made you in His image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not have the right to be offended. You do not have the right to sin. And so, one of the kindest, most loving things God comes to do is to dignify every human being with the sentence of guilty. No, you are not nothing. You are not worthless. You are not a mere victim of circumstances. No, you are a man; you are woman made with intelligence and the power of choice, and you have sinned. You have loved evil and hated good. You have hurt yourself and you have hurt others. And yes, you have been hurt and wronged, but you always had the responsibility to choose to respond with patience, kindness, and love. We are guilty. We deserve death. We are sinful and unclean. And the moment we tell the truth and take responsibility for our sins, Christ offers to take our sins away and promises to raise us up with the dignifying power of His grace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffalo supermarket shooter sentenced to life in prison without parole</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffalo supermarket mass shooter Payton Gendron was sentenced to life in prison without parole on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and domestic terrorism, among other charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gendron killed 10 people in a racially motivated massacre in Buffalo, New York last year. He pleaded guilty to all 15 counts brought by Buffalo prosecutors.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Judge Blocks N.Y. Law Mandating Social Media 'Hateful Conduct' Policies</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge has blocked New York's new law that prohibits hate speech on social media, ruling the measure violates the Constitution's protection of free speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. on Tuesday, in Volokh v. James, sided with the Volokh Conspiracy legal blog and Peter Thiel-backed video site Rumble Inc., which claimed the law will hurt online services and silence disfavored viewpoints.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul in June signed a legislative package that included new regulations governing how social media platforms police what the law calls "hateful conduct."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The "Hateful Conduct Law" required that social media websites make it easy for users to report "incidents of hateful conduct," and to respond to complaints explaining how the matter is being handled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter began his ruling by citing the Supreme Court's 2017 Matal v. Tam decision in which the justices unanimously ruled that a federal law prohibiting trademark names that disparage others was unconstitutional because "speech may not be banned on the grounds that it expresses ideas that offend."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After calling the law "well-intentioned," Carter explained his decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Yet, the First Amendment protects from state regulation speech that may be deemed 'hateful' and generally disfavors regulation of speech based on its content unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest," Carter wrote in his decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Hateful Conduct Law both compels social media networks to speak about the contours of hate speech and chills the constitutionally protected speech of social media users, without articulating a compelling governmental interest or ensuring that the law is narrowly tailored to that goal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In the face of our national commitment to the free expression of speech, even where that speech is offensive or repugnant, Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, prohibiting enforcement of the law, is GRANTED."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter said the law overreached.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Hateful Conduct Law does not merely require that a social media network provide its users with a mechanism to complain about instances of 'hateful conduct,'" Carter wrote. "The law also requires that a social media network must make a &lsquo;policy&rsquo; available on its website which details how the network will respond to a complaint of hateful content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In other words, the law requires that social media networks devise and implement a written policy &mdash; i.e., speech."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secret China Donations to University of Delaware Soared After the Opening of the Biden Institute</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second university has been found to have received more than $6.7 million in anonymous donations from China, including direct funding from the Chinese government, after Joe Biden set up a program there in his name, according to a Government Accountability Institute analysis. The revelation comes following reporting that anonymous China-linked funds flowing to the University of Pennsylvania almost tripled after the inauguration of the Penn-Biden Center, which illegally housed classified documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 13, 2017, less than seven weeks after concluding his second term as vice president, Joe Biden announced the founding of the Biden Institute at his home state&rsquo;s University of Delaware (UD). According to the announcement, part of Biden&rsquo;s &ldquo;vision for the institute is an annual conference at UD, similar to the World Economic Forum or the Aspen Institute.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of Biden&rsquo;s announcement at UD, multiple members of the Biden family were working on deals worth millions of dollars with foreign businessmen linked to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence. And Biden&rsquo;s other university program at the University of Pennsylvania was apparently housing classified documents from the Obama-Biden administration in an improper way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to hosting the Biden Institute, UD had never disclosed any funding from China. One year later (and just two months after the Penn Biden center opened its D.C. office), anonymous donations from China to UD skyrocketed. The first payment came in April 2018 in the amount of $3,204,070 from an anonymous donor in China. In December 2018, another anonymous donation from China arrived for $1,869,515. A third anonymous China-linked payment, for $624,904, arrived in December 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the year that Biden was campaigning for president, anonymous Chinese state-linked entities sent three more payments totaling $1,005,761 to UD, the bulk of which arrived after Biden had been declared the president-elect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of these donations from China&mdash;with a combined total of $1,005,761&mdash;were reported as coming from a &ldquo;Foreign Government Source,&rdquo; according to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) records assembled from information reported to the DOE by the University of Delaware.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that, according to the available records, none the donations from China to the University of Pennsylvania following the creation of the Penn Biden Center appear to have been reported to the DOE as coming from a &ldquo;Foreign Government Source&rdquo; &mdash; a fact which led at least one fact-checker to conclude that the Penn Biden Center was being unfairly labeled as &ldquo;China-funded&rdquo; because the influx of funding from China to UPenn following its establishment was not given this DOE identifier. However, three donations originating from China to the University of Delaware in the years following the launch of the Biden Institute clearly bear the &ldquo;Foreign Government Source&rdquo; identifier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual DOE record field for this identifier asks, &ldquo;Is this funding from a government?&rdquo; For these three donations, the answer supplied by the University of Delaware is &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; as seen in the three images below taken from the DOE website (highlight added for emphasis).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither the Biden Institute nor the UD have responded to requests to identify the Chinese donors or explain why the Chinese government decided to fund UD after the Biden Institute was created.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Biden Institute is how it was conceived.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial idea for Biden Institute at UD was apparently hatched by Joe&rsquo;s son, Hunter Biden, while the elder Biden was still the vice president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2016, Hunter Biden met with UD&rsquo;s incoming president, Dr. Dennis Assanis, as Hunter and his business associates were making plans to create a &ldquo;stage&rdquo; to promote the &ldquo;Biden brand,&rdquo; emails from Hunter&rsquo;s abandoned laptop show. Other emails on the laptop indicate that Hunter and his business associates were concerned about boosting Joe&rsquo;s &ldquo;future earnings potential,&rdquo; while Joe was still the vice president.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota Bans Child Sex Changes</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem signed legislation Monday banning both surgical and nonsurgical sex change procedures for minors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &ldquo;Help Not Harm&rdquo; bill bars health care providers from prescribing minors puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones or performing cross-sex surgeries on minors. Doctors found violating the law will have their medical licenses revoked. The move comes amid a broader push from red states to crack down on the procedures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients harmed by violations of the new law have three years, or until they turn 25, to seek civil damages; whichever date is later, according to the bill. The legislation takes effect July 1, and health care professionals may keep patients on cross-sex drug regimens through the end of the year if they determine it&rsquo;s necessary to gradually wean them off the drugs for the sake of their health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cross-sex genital surgeries are rare for minors, numerous clinics and hospitals offer puberty blockers, hormones and mastectomies to minors as part of the gender transition process; the procedures are still legal at the federal level and in most states.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In Chapter 7 of <em>Paradise Restored</em>, David Chilton discusses the fiery Glory Cloud that led Israel through the desert during the Exodus. The cloud was a theophany of the Holy God Himself and has important and significant attributes that we should recognize when we read the rest of the Bible. It was both a Guide and a Protection for the wandering Israelites&hellip; and for us today.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Wednesday, February 15th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/ohios-apocalyptic-chemical-disaster-rages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.zerohedge.com/political/ohios-apocalyptic-chemical-disaster-rages</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Get The Hell Out Of There" - Ohio's Chemical Disaster Rages On</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the US government is dispensing millions of dollars in resources to treat balloons as an existential crisis, a small town in Ohio finds itself engulfed in what actually looks like the apocalypse. Perhaps by design, all of the drama surrounding violations of US airspace by Chinese spy initiatives has done well to keep what is becoming one of the worst environmental disasters in recent memory from getting any headlines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chaos began early last week when a train of more than 100 cars derailed in East Palestine, Ohio near the state&rsquo;s border with Pennsylvania with roughly 5,000 residents. The accident launched fifty of those hundred freight cars from the tracks. Twenty of the freight cars on the train were carrying hazardous materials, ten of which were derailed. While the accident had no fatalities, of those ten cars, five contained pressurized vinyl chloride, a highly flammable carcinogenic gas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DHiXZUgQEwc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/DHiXZUgQEwc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to address the volatile scenario around the crash site, the Ohio Emergency Management Agency executed its plan of venting the toxic gas with a controlled burn in order to evade an uncontrolled explosion which presented the risk of catastrophic damage. &ldquo;Within the last two hours, a drastic temperature change has taken place in a rail car, and there is now the potential of a catastrophic tanker failure which could cause an explosion with the potential of deadly shrapnel traveling up to a mile,&rdquo; Gov. Mike DeWine warned in statement explaining the decision to take action to avert widespread devastation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that operation sent large plumes of smoke containing vinyl chloride, phosgene, hydrogen chloride, and other gases into the air as the flames from the controlled burn raged on for days. Phosgene in particular is a highly toxic gas that can cause vomiting and respiratory trouble. The toxicity of phosgene gas is so potent that it was previously used as a chemical weapon during the First World War.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1625155991724605440"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1625155991724605440</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hazardous airborne chemicals prompted officials to issue mandatory evacuation and shelter-in-place orders within a one-mile radius of where the train derailed. Those orders forced nearly 2,000 residents of East Palestine out of their homes. Despite the public safety risk in proximity to the crash site, over 500 people within the parameters of the evacuation order refused to leave their homes. However, those orders were lifted on February 8th, allowing residents to return to the area adjacent to the disaster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead fish are being pulled from rivers outside East Palestine, Ohio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trucks doing the work are labeled EnviroScience, an Ohio-based company that provides "time-sensitive solutions to environmental challenges."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Breshears found her chickens dead ten miles from East Palestine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holzer&rsquo;s concerns were echoed by reports from other residents who described similar conditions near their own properties. One of those residents was Katlyn Schwarzwaelder, the operator of a local dog kennel in nearby Darlington, Pennsylvania. The catastrophe caused her to leave her home despite the fact that it lies more than 10 miles away from the site of the controlled burn. After fleeing to Boardman, Ohio, 15 miles away from the derailment, Schwarzwaelder stated she received multiple reports of dead chickens, fish, and other animals from friends and acquaintances. One affected resident told Schwarzwaelder that they let their 2-year old dog out to use the bathroom only for it never to return. When they embarked upon a search for their missing pet, they found it dead in their yard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testimony from Holzer, Schwarzwaelder, and others paints a drastically different picture than the official narrative tailored by officials who assured residents that the situation was under control. The poor air quality presents short and long term health risks to the public considering the carcinogenic effects of the chemicals. Carcinogens like vinyl chloride can cause cancer in organs including the liver, according to Kevin Crist, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering who also serves as the Director of Ohio University&rsquo;s Air Quality Center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magnitude of this story has been seemingly scrubbed from the public view as national media outlets continue to run sensationalist headlines about issues that look innocuous in comparison. It is an instance of history being rewritten in real time, setting a precedent that would allow victims of other widespread devastation to be swept under the rug. However, the scenes of the horror engulfing this small town in America&rsquo;s heartland may prove to make this disaster impossible to ignore, rightfully putting the spotlight on the shortcomings of state and federal agencies tasked with emergency response management whose continued lack of accountability enables them to fail the American public time and time again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I move on, I want to remind everyone, that the federal government isn&rsquo;t who we should be relying on. All their authority was granted by our creator. It&rsquo;s our Lord and savior Jesus Christ who our faith must lie upon. So we take our prayer requests about Ohio to our Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US to Sell 26 Million More Barrels From Strategic Oil Reserve</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration plans to sell more crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, fulfilling budget directives mandated years ago that it had sought to stop as oil prices have stabilized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The congressionally mandated sale will amount to 26 million barrels of crude, according to people familiar with the matter. The sale is in accordance with a budget mandate enacted in 2015 for the current fiscal year, said a spokesperson for the Department of Energy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Energy Department has sought to stop some of the sales required by 2015 legislation so that it can refill the emergency reserve, which currently has about 371 million barrels. After this latest release, the reserve will dip to about 345 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden officials decided last year to tap 180 million barrels from the strategic reserve in an effort to ease supply issues after Russia invaded Ukraine, upending global oil flows and sending crude above $100 a barrel. Some Republicans have criticized the Biden administration for that drawdown, which was the biggest release ever and helped drain the SPR to its lowest level since 1983. Critics admonished the move as a political stunt intended to combat rising gasoline prices ahead of midterm elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden officials have since spoken with energy companies about purchasing oil to refill the SPR when prices approach $70 a barrel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest release comes after Russia unveiled plans to curtail production by half-a-million barrels a day next month to retaliate against sanctions. Russia&rsquo;s move, which was downplayed by the European Union, follows China&rsquo;s rapid economic reopening with the scrapping of Covid-19 restrictions. The SPR release may give pause to the OPEC+ alliance, which earlier said that global oil markets remain balanced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how did the market react?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US House last month passed legislation meant to curb the Energy secretary&rsquo;s ability to use the reserve unless the government increases the amount of federal lands available for gas and oil drilling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other congressionally required releases &mdash; about 140 million barrels slated for fiscal years 2024 through 2027 &mdash; were canceled at the Energy Department&rsquo;s behest after lawmakers in December approved a provision in a giant spending bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark for crude, fell 1% to trade near $79 a barrel after the announcement of more barrels.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspect in Michigan State University shooting found dead from self-inflicted gunshot, at least 3 people killed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suspect in the Michigan State University shooting was found dead off campus late Monday night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSU Police Interim Deputy Chief Chris Rozman said, &ldquo;There is no longer a threat on campus and the shelter-in-place has been lifted.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police had earlier described the suspect as a "black male, shorter in stature, red shoes, jean jacket, wearing a baseball cap that is navy with a lighter brim." Rozman said the deceased individual matched the description of the suspect but did not reveal the suspect's identity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a press conference late Monday night, Rozman said 3 people had been killed and 5 have been hospitalized. The victims, some in critical condition, were transported to Sparrow Hospital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police responded to reports of an active shooting at Michigan State University in East Lansing Monday night and students were ordered to shelter in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident took place at 8:18 pm inside Berkey Hall the location of MSU's Department of Sociology on the northern boundary of the campus. The shelter-in-place order went out at 8:31 pm telling students to stay inside and barricade themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Run, Hide, Fight. Run means evacuate away from danger if you can do so safely, Hide means to secure-in-place, and Fight means protect yourself if no other option," MSU said in the alert.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to authorities, the suspect walked to the MSU Union, approximately 19 minutes away from the initial shooting site and opened fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of officers from the FBI, ATF, Michigan State Police, and other agencies are still assisting on campus. All campus activities have been canceled for 48 hours and authorities have asked people not to come to the campus on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that was some heavy subject matter, so let&rsquo;s go ahead and end with this&hellip; this is the fight laugh feast network afterall!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/14/man-facing-jail-over-theft-of-almost-200000-cadbury-creme-eggs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/14/man-facing-jail-over-theft-of-almost-200000-cadbury-creme-eggs</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man facing jail over theft of almost 200,000 Cadbury Creme Eggs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chocolate thief is facing jail after admitting he stole almost 200,000 Cadbury Creme Eggs in a heist worth more than &pound;31,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joby Pool, 32, dubbed &ldquo;the Easter bunny&rdquo; by police, used a stolen lorry cab to make off with chocolate after breaking into a Telford industrial unit with a metal grinder on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is expected to be jailed for about two years next month, after pleading guilty to theft and criminal damage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening the facts of the case on Tuesday, prosecutor Owen Beale told Kidderminster magistrates court: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you have seen the news recently &ndash; there was a load that was stolen and on the trailer was Cadbury&rsquo;s products, a large number of Creme Eggs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said Pool, a self-employed ground worker, used a tractor unit that had been stolen in the Yorkshire area in October to tow away the trailer full of chocolate, which was then driven away, eventually reaching the northbound M42.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pool was spotted by police and &ldquo;gave up at junction 11 and walked towards the police with his hands up. He was arrested and the load was recovered&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This clearly wasn&rsquo;t spur-of-the-moment offending, if I can put it like that, because he had taken with him a tractor unit and he had to know that the load was there in the first place,&rdquo; said Beale.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magistrates were told Pool, from West Yorkshire, was previously convicted of theft, handling stolen goods and driving while disqualified in 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beale said: &ldquo;This is clearly an organised criminal matter. You don&rsquo;t just happen to learn about a trailer with that kind of value being available.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defence solicitor John McMillan, told the court that Pool understood a substantial sentence was likely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a series of tweets on Monday, West Mercia police described the incident as an &ldquo;eggs-travagent theft&rdquo; of a &ldquo;chocolate collection box&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Shortly after the theft a vehicle, presumably purporting to be the Easter bunny, was stopped northbound on the M42 and a man was arrested on suspicion of theft,&rdquo; they said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pool will be sentenced at Shrewsbury crown court on 14 March.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>n this episode Ezra Institute Fellow Michael Thiessen discusses what it means to take the name of the Lord, both rightly and wrongly, in the church, in politics, and in any other sphere. We also talk about the nature of oaths and authority, the Sermon on the Mount, what it means for something to be damned by God, and door-to-door sales. NOTE: we do not use language flippantly, but this episode contains language that parents may not want your children to hear.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog Post</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real School Choice &amp; Conservative Chimpanzees</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden recently got a bunch of Republicans to do what Democrats have been trying to do for decades: get them to embrace socialism. Ok, most Republicans are soft-socialists nowadays anyway, but Sleepy Joe got most of the Republican side of Congress to stand up and cheer for socialism during his recent State of the Union address. He got them to boo his accusation that they weren&rsquo;t true blue socialists, and then when he asked if they were in, they stood up and cheered. Biden played them like a drum, and the next day CNN had Republican representatives doubling and tripling down on it. It was masterful, if it wasn&rsquo;t so sad.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course the topic was Social Security and whether the Federal Government should take care of our parents and grandparents. Republicans are idiots. Republicans are fools. There was a masterful opportunity to take and they missed it. They took the bait. They bowed and scraped at the altar of the Almighty Sugar Daddy State, almost as if they had already completely forgotten about 2020. It would have been a glorious moment for conservatives to stand up and speak clearly into the microphone. How many of our parents and grandparents died alone in nursing homes? How many were locked down, isolated, deprived of personal care, familial affection, and honor? Don&rsquo;t you understand that our twisted nursing home culture is a direct result of looking to the state to take care of our parents and grandparents?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, we absolutely want to sunset Social Security. Absolutely. All day long, every day of the week. Is there no conservative willing to stand up for our parents and grandparents, who will insist that everything the Federal government does that is outside of its God-ordained assignment is inefficient, cumbersome, and ultimately sucks at whatever it is they are trying to do? All you need to do is go down to your local DMV. OK, how about the IRS? Biden had the audacity to claim that as the (apparently) new CEO of every major industry in America he was ordering sweeping changes, prohibiting various fees and surcharges, particularly for the airline industry, including for the privilege of having your family sit together. Biden is tired, he says, of treating children like baggage. But of course if a mother wanted to treat one of her more challenging children like baggage, why couldn&rsquo;t she? I mean, an unborn child requires a whole lot of energy and care, and with Biden&rsquo;s help, he believes she ought to be able to go down to the local Planned Parenthood (and for a small fee), unload that so-called &ldquo;baggage.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where was I? Sorry, I got a bit distracted. But the point is that the same goons who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between baggage and children want to take care of your elderly parents and grandparents, and the whole Republican side of congress stood up and cheered, like a bunch of chimpanzees clapping for bananas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona ESAs &amp; My Vigorous Misgivings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, but here&rsquo;s the real point of this post: a whole bunch of conservatives are doing the same thing with &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; and Educational Savings Accounts (ESAs). I posted a lengthy thread last week after reading through the Arizona ESA program which is currently being heralded by many conservatives and school choice advocates as the &ldquo;model&rdquo; legislation. But the really short version can be summarized by the immortal words of Admiral Ackbar in Star Wars: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trap!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I don&rsquo;t merely want to repeat what I said previously about all my misgivings. All those misgivings are still alive and well and they&rsquo;ve even grown a third eye and developed a vigorous twitch. But what I want to do is quickly review my findings from the Arizona ESA legislation and then bring this thing in for a landing with a plea for conservatives to see a really glorious opportunity in the &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; discussion if only we don&rsquo;t act like most of our Republican leaders in congress, so long as we don&rsquo;t bark and clap like a seal simply because they say some conservative-ish sounding words. Don&rsquo;t get sucked into embracing more socialism by Joe Biden or his Republican colleagues. Yeah, as the kids like to say, that was a pretty sick burn.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So first, my findings: While the Arizona ESA program claims that &ldquo;each student&rsquo;s funding follows the student,&rdquo; the legislation only actually allows for $6,500 of the student&rsquo;s funding to follow the student. I might have a tiny ounce of hope that this was at least moving in the right direction, except that more than $11,000 is spent by the state and local taxpayers on each public school student, and that doesn&rsquo;t count all federal dollars on top of that, all of which continue going to the government schools. For every student that opts into the Arizona ESA program, over $600 additional dollars are immediately added back to the public school that they left, even though that student no longer attends that school. So tips galore. And if that weren&rsquo;t enough, the fact sheet defending the Arizona ESAs boasts: &ldquo;In fact, the rapid growth in Arizona&rsquo;s ESA program has tracked closely with major increases in per pupil funding for public schools over the past decade&hellip;&rdquo; As proof of that trajectory continuing, the fact sheet assures us that a companion bill has been introduced in the Arizona legislature to add $400 million additional funds to public schools, designated for all public school districts and charter schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pause here for just a moment for me to make a comment about conservatives and rhetoric. When I posted these findings on Facebook, a friend from another state pushed back a bit about my Debby-downer appraisal of the program and linked to several conservative sites praising the Arizona legislation. I cheerfully clicked on the link, and the first sentence I read was this: &ldquo;First, the left told us that school choice would decimate the funding of public education. But then, Arizona passed the nation&rsquo;s first universal education savings account (ESA) program last year, and funding for the state&rsquo;s public schools still went up nearly a billion dollars even as tens of thousands of kids have joined the ESA program.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now regardless of the exact details of the ESA program or where the funding is coming from, you just lost me. This website is a Republican clapping like a seal for Joe Biden socialism. At the very least, this website doesn&rsquo;t understand what conservatives actually want. I don&rsquo;t want to increase funding for government schools. I want to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">decrease</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding for government schools. I want to dismantle government schools. I want to see them closed down. What&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for? Ah right, I want to see government schools </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">sunset</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because I&rsquo;m not a communist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m not sure how to break this to you, but one of the central tenets of Marxism in the Communist Manifesto is &ldquo;Free education for all children in public schools.&rdquo; And of course by &ldquo;free&rdquo; Marx meant &ldquo;pounded out of your flesh in taxes whether you use them or not.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I&rsquo;m not a communist so that is also why I am not a revolutionary, and I would be happy to slowly sunset public education. I would be happy to nickel and dime the damn thing to death. But what I don&rsquo;t want to do is to take incremental steps to invigorate, strengthen, and expand government education corruption and power. When some of my more revolutionary friends wondered why I&rsquo;m willing to end abortion incrementally but not public education, I replied: &ldquo;I actually would support true incremental steps toward school choice, but if a 15wk abortion ban gave $400mil to Planned Parenthood, I would oppose it for the same reason.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t dismantle something by giving it more money.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked my friend about this massive increase in spending on education, the reply said that this represents the ordinary increases in education budgets, which might be true, but if so, I&rsquo;m still against that. If an educational system has fewer students, they should have fewer dollars, not more. The incentives here are perverse. Less for more? That isn&rsquo;t capitalism. That isn&rsquo;t a free market. And ultimately all that money has to come from taxes. If this continues, tax payers could find themselves paying the same amount of money as before (or more) even with the $6500 dollar ESA boost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, back to the Arizona ESA program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is millions and perhaps a billion more dollars in public school funding a massive increase in the government school budget and funding in Arizona, the program is also the beginning of government oversight of private schools and homeschooling. The text of the Arizona ESA expansion bill explicitly requires that the curriculum ESAs are spent on must be approved by the Arizona department of education. Perhaps this approval will begin as something relatively benign, but if you think it&rsquo;s going to stay that way, you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention. Next, a &ldquo;qualified school&rdquo; includes your standard government &ldquo;non-discrimination&rdquo; clause, currently specifying race, color, or national origin. But if you don&rsquo;t think that will soon include sexual orientation, sexual identity, and puppy-lovers, I&rsquo;ve got a beachfront property in Kansas to sell you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I firmly believe in school choice, and I also believe that our actual education dollars should follow the students, but I&rsquo;m not aware of any &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; program that is honestly allowing the actual student funding to follow the student wherever their parents choose to send them to school. Of course, it should be remembered that tax dollars actually belong to the tax payers, and if we&rsquo;re talking about money for education, real school choice would include the freedom not to pay taxes for schools we don&rsquo;t use. I know this is a really radical notion, but I think it&rsquo;s a winning point: people shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to pay for goods and services they don&rsquo;t use. Parents shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to pay for schools they have decided are not best for their children. We don&rsquo;t force parents to send checks to certain doctors and medical providers, regardless of where they receive their medical care. Why would we do that with education? The name of this is socialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very least, if we cannot completely opt out (monetarily) of schools that we have decided are not best for our children, how about tax credits that simply refund our real tax dollars that we didn&rsquo;t actually use on government schools? I don&rsquo;t think they should have taken our money for a service we don&rsquo;t use in the first place, but I would certainly be OK with at least getting that money back. That would seem to me to be an incremental step in the right direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this demonstrates that government education is a mafia with a monopoly using our tax-payer dollars to rig the system and make it more difficult for hard working Americans to provide the education they believe is best for their kids. Perhaps the one silver lining in all of this is simply the indication that government school mobsters can be bought off. I would urge somebody with connections to broker a deal with some big tech company (where you at Elon?), offering to infuse some state coffers with bazillions of dollars in exchange for two things: a number of seats on the state board of education and the real freedom of choice for parents to completely opt out of the system: keeping their tax dollars and spending their money on whatever educational program they desire.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far my diatribe on Twitter, closing with &ldquo;In the meantime, remember that everything the government funds is inefficient, corrupt, has strings attached, and ultimately goes woke and bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I really don&rsquo;t mean this post as merely a whine-session, and I know there are many well-meaning conservatives (that are not Chimpanzees) that are simply interested in seeing the government monopoly broken. And count me as a reasonable incrementalist. I don&rsquo;t need a perfect bill to support. I&rsquo;m no perfectionist. I&rsquo;m a reformer; not a revolutionary. All I need is a bill that actually nudges us in the direction of real school choice, real educational freedom, and a truly free market for education.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I&rsquo;ll end here simply with a plea for conservative rhetoric. I think we really do have an important opportunity right in front of us with the school choice discussion. And I am not at all calling for conservatives to be purists who can&rsquo;t be pleased with any compromise. But we also need to have a very clear idea of what we are aiming for. If we are not aiming for true educational freedom, true school choice, which means parents having the true freedom to use their own money to pay for whatever education they deem best for their children, then we will not know which direction we&rsquo;re going or even if we&rsquo;re making any progress at all. When you have no destination in mind, anywhere seems like progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there&rsquo;s a glorious opportunity for real progress in terms of practical policies, and I think with that opportunity is an opportunity to change the conversation. Let&rsquo;s talk about real educational choice and freedom. Let&rsquo;s talk about the sovereignty of parents over the educational choices of their children. Virginia Governor Youngkin was arguably elected partially on the steam of the claims of educational fascists who claimed that the experts and school boards and departments of education trumped parents, especially in the wake of a transgender bathroom assault. Do you see that opening? They are cramming CRT and sexual confusion down the throats of preschoolers. If Christian and conservative parents stand up and say enough is enough, we can make a difference. But the goal needs to be clear: we are not socialists; we are not communists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe in freedom of choice, parental sovereignty, and we refuse to be charged for an education system that hates us and hates our values. We want to keep our hard earned money and spend it on the education that we believe is best for our children. We want a level playing field, a truly free market for education, with schools competing without government intrusion, without the government putting its fingers on the scales. Let&rsquo;s change the conversation. Let&rsquo;s brainstorm. Let&rsquo;s invite our brightest minds and legislators together, and let&rsquo;s craft something better. Let&rsquo;s craft something that is actually moving towards freedom. And I&rsquo;m not just saying this, I&rsquo;m having conversations with key players to do this very thing, and I hope to have more to share on this very soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China claims US sent more than 10 spy balloons into country's airspace</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a Chinese official stated that more than 10 high-altitude balloons from the US have flown into China&rsquo;s airspace over the last year without the country&rsquo;s permission. The US has denied these allegations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a Monday briefing that "It is also common for US balloons to illegally enter the airspace of other countries. Since last year, US high-altitude balloons have illegally flown over China&rsquo;s airspace more than 10 times without the approval of Chinese authorities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v29bau8-rep.-mike-waltz-i-hope-this-wakes-the-country-up-to-the-cold-war-that-were-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v29bau8-rep.-mike-waltz-i-hope-this-wakes-the-country-up-to-the-cold-war-that-were-.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Associated Press, Wang did not give additional details about the alleged US balloons, how China has dealt with these balloons, or whether the balloons had military or government links.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang said the US should "first reflect on itself and change course, rather than smear and instigate a confrontation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegation came after the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon that traveled across North America, targeting it off the coast of South Carolina. Additional unidentified flying objects later identified as balloons have been shot down since then.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China has claimed that the balloon shot down off the coast of South Carolina was an unnamed airship created for meteorological research, and that this balloon was blown off course.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China has accused the US of overreacting by shooting down the balloon, and has threatened to take action in response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on Monday that claims the US has operated surveillance balloons over China is false.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Removes 'Negative Flags' for Conservative Sites</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft removed its "negative flags" for conservative media outlets on a "secret blacklist," including Newsmax, that were blocked from getting key advertising dollars, the Washington Examiner reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its series on "disinformation" tracking groups, the Examiner reported internal data showed Microsoft was doing a review, and suspending its subscription to a tracking group devoted to defunding what it sees as "disfavored speech."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft-owned advertising company Xandr previously abided by a "secret blacklist" of conservative news put together by the Global Disinformation Index, a British organization with two affiliated U.S. nonprofits, the Examiner reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft now appears to be taking steps to distance itself from GDI, and has deleted flags such as "false/misleading" and "reprehensible/offensive" for right-leaning websites, the Examiner reported, citing the internal data it obtained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I just checked in Xandr's platform again and can confirm that all rejection flags have been removed from domains," an unnamed executive in the ad industry told the Examiner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xandr had labeled 39 conservative domains as "false/misleading." Townhall, whose publisher is Salem Media Group, was flagged as "reprehensible/offensive," the Examiner reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Examiner also noted it was among those flagged as "false/misleading," along with Newsmax, the Daily Wire, RealClearPolitics, Drudge Report, Breitbart, the Blaze, the Washington Times, Judicial Watch, and the Media Research Center affiliate MRC.TV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An internal Xandr dataset showed all those websites no longer have a designation, though it's unclear if they are getting ads from certain brands without an "approved" classification.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We try to take a principled approach to accuracy and fighting foreign propaganda," a Microsoft spokesperson told the Examiner. "We're working quickly to fix the issue, and Xandr has stopped using GDI's services while we are doing a larger review."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Examiner, Xandr informed publishers in September 2022 it would begin to adopt GDI's "dynamic exclusion list," which the organization feeds to ad companies. Through a list that may include at least 2,000 websites, GDI allegedly tried to pressure companies to shut down certain sites.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Examiner also reported the GDI has claimed the 10 "riskiest" outlets are Newsmax, the American Spectator, the Federalist, the American Conservative, One America News Network, the Blaze, the Daily Wire, RealClearPolitics, Reason, and the New York Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDI compiles the list with oversight from its own "advisory panel," which includes Ben Nimmo, global lead for threat intelligence at Facebook parent company Meta, and left-leaning journalist Anne Applebaum, the Examiner reported, who once dismissed Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings as uninteresting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDI has claimed the 10 "least risky" websites are NPR, ProPublica, the Associated Press, Insider, the New York Times, USA Today, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News, HuffPost, and the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney Will Not Fight DeSantis Takeover of Special District in Orlando</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney will not fight a bill that gives Gov. Ron DeSantis broad powers over its Orlando theme parks, after the bill passed both houses of the Florida Legislature this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill establishes a new district to assume the powers held by the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which Disney has controlled since it was created in 1967. The new entity, the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, will be run by a five-member board appointed by DeSantis and confirmed by the state Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Disney said it is &ldquo;ready to work within this new framework,&rdquo; indicating that it will not try to challenge the law in court. The Legislature moved to dissolve the Reedy Creek district last April, after Disney came out against the Parental Rights in Education law, known to its critics as the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Say Gay&rdquo; bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some observers had suggested that Disney could file a First Amendment lawsuit or seek to challenge the takeover on various other grounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Jeff Vahle, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, said in the statement released on Friday that the company will accommodate itself to the new reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For more than 50 years, the Reedy Creek Improvement District has operated at the highest standards, and we appreciate all that the District has done to help our destination grow and become one of the largest economic contributors and employers in the state,&rdquo; Vahle said. &ldquo;We are focused on the future and are ready to work within this new framework and we will continue to innovate, inspire and bring joy to the millions of guests who come to Florida to visit Walt Disney World each year.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation was introduced on Monday. It passed the state House of Representatives on Thursday on a vote of 82-31, with 81 Republicans and one Democrat voting &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; All 31 &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes came from Democrats. The state Senate approved the bill on Friday on a party-line vote, with 26 Republicans in favor and nine Democrats opposed. It now goes to DeSantis for his signature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reedy Creek Improvement District has broad authority over zoning, infrastructure, fire response and public utilities over a nearly 40-square-mile area in Osceola and Orange counties. The entity levies taxes on Disney and issues tax-exempt bonds for infrastructure projects. As by far the largest landowner within the district, Disney has had the power to elect the five members of the Board of Supervisors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In establishing the new district, the Legislature left almost all of its powers intact. The legislation does remove the power to build a nuclear power plant and an airport, but those powers had never been used.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The practical effect of the change could end up being negligible and park employees and visitors are unlikely to notice any difference. But DeSantis and future governors will have broad power to make life difficult for Disney if they choose to exercise it.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/seattle-public-schools-consider-closures-student-enrollment-plunges-post"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/seattle-public-schools-consider-closures-student-enrollment-plunges-post</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Public Schools consider closures as student enrollment plunges post-pandemic</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Public Schools may have to close some of its schools over the next few years as the district battles budget shortages and plummeting enrollment after the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district does not plan on closing any of its 106 schools next year, and the earliest closures may occur in the 2024-2025 school year, The Seattle Times reported last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidating some schools for the 2024-2025 year could save $28 million as the district projects a $92 million budget shortfall that year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student enrollment has dropped to roughly 50,000 students from nearly 54,000 in the 2019-2020 school year. In a best-case scenario, school administrators expect 49,000 students by 2032, and in a worst-case scenario, enrollment may be as low as 43,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The declining enrollment comes after homeschooling rates nearly doubled in Washington at the height of the COVID pandemic and are still at elevated levels from the 2019-2020 school year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jen Garrison Stuber of the Washington Homeschool Organization told Fox News that homeschool enrollment is down, however, in Seattle from pre-pandemic numbers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I really think that what Seattle's seeing, where those students have gone are either to private schools or they've left the school district and have moved elsewhere," she said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-politician-suggests-fix-states-brazen-prostitution-legalize-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-politician-suggests-fix-states-brazen-prostitution-legalize-it</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California politician suggests fix to state's brazen prostitution: Legalize it</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A San Francisco County leader voiced support to legalize prostitution in the city as brazen soliciting spirals across the state after a new law took effect this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What&rsquo;s happening right now on Capp Street is it&rsquo;s become more brazen, and bigger than we&rsquo;ve ever seen it before," county Supervisor Hillary Ronen told The Los Angeles Times last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Instead of repeating the same cycle that we&rsquo;ve repeated for decades, it&rsquo;s time to try something new."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ronen called the situation "out of control" in comments to the San Francisco Chronicle, and pushed for San Francisco to install barriers on Capp Street in the heart of San Francisco&rsquo;s Mission District, after it became lined with prostitutes and pimps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, she is expected to announce a resolution that will urge state lawmakers to legalize prostitution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surge in prostitution and apparent human trafficking in California comes after a change in law took effect last month that repealed a ban on loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. The bill's sponsor, Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, argued the change would protect transgender women whom he said are disproportionately targeted by police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police and Republicans in the state have since sounded off that the new law sparked prostitution to explode in certain areas of the state, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said with the emboldened prostitution rings come robberies, shootings, aggravated assaults and other crimes. Many of the pimps are gang-affiliated and take no issue with beating women or going after rival pimps who try to poach one of the workers, they said. Some even record the beatdowns because they "think it&rsquo;s funny," police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Coalition to Abolish Slavery &amp; Trafficking, which is one of the largest and oldest direct service providers for sex and labor trafficking survivors in the U.S., threw its support behind the bill and told Fox News Digital that it endorsed repealing the former policy "because we know that reducing the criminalization of survivors will help prevent human trafficking."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now finally&hellip; it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you missed it, Sunday evening, the superbowl took place, with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game was an incredible one with highlight play after highlight play, with both teams putting up points:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWkt79xkd00"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWkt79xkd00</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 2:30-2:37</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 3:47-3:57</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 4:44-4:55</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 12:25-12:36</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 14:24-15:01</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay&hellip; so for those keeping score at home, it&rsquo;s 35-35 at this point in the game, with just a few minutes left. Then, this happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 15:45-16:52</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What an anti-climactic ending&hellip; if you&rsquo;re the official, how on earth do you throw that flag? James Bradbury, the cornerback for the Eagles who had the flag thrown on him, thought it was the correct call, so kudos to him for owning up, but even with that admission, the ball was clearly uncatchable for JuJu Smith-Schuster&hellip; Now the Chiefs still would have likely taken the lead with a field goal, but then Jalen Hurts and the Eagles offense would&rsquo;ve had over a minute to get down the field, and potentially tie, or win the game. Such an anti-climactic ending. This is from a guy who didn&rsquo;t have a dog in the fight by the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">what are your guys thoughts on my take? You Eagles fans can send your fan mail to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garrison@fightlaughfeast.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, hello, Neighbor! Amanda (The Peaches) is back, and boy has she missed you!&nbsp; Really, she's the Brett Cooper of the Fight Laugh Feast Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a long hiatus, we're back at the kitchen table and trying desperately to organize all our many, many thoughts.</p>
<p>Let's talk about those anonymously-run Facebook groups that exist solely to "call out" a particular person or organization.&nbsp; There's something unhealthy about spending<em> all your time</em> thinking and talking about the so-called sins of a particular individual. That's the sort of obsession that tends to make a person crazy--which could explain how, after a few years, they may end up doxxing a teenaged boy and not realizing how insane that looks to normal people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; John has spent many days attracting hate comments on social media (hundreds of them) because he just keeps repeating his belief that children should not be groomed with sexually explicit material at their government school...&nbsp; &nbsp;John's posts are, of course, ridiculous because there has never been any sexually explicit material found in ANY government school--and also, taking away the sexually explicit material that minors NEEEEEEEED to access in school would be Fascism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally:&nbsp; The topic of New Ageism and Occult practices just keeps popping up. Did you know where the term "hoodwinked" came from, Pkarlgh?&nbsp; How could a person POSSIBLY be messing with Ouija boards and crystals and shakras and spell-casting and trying to make contact with dead people and STILL think she's a "Christian?"&nbsp; Great question!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump REINSTATED on Facebook, Instagram</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Meta reinstated former President Donald Trump on their Facebook and Instagram social media platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta announced in January that it intended to reinstate Trump's accounts, a full two years after they claimed he was suspended for violating their terms of service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v274pzq-meta-president-for-global-affairs-nick-clegg-on-trumps-reinstatement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v274pzq-meta-president-for-global-affairs-nick-clegg-on-trumps-reinstatement.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg wrote in a statement, "Two years ago, we took action in what were extreme and highly unusual circumstances. We indefinitely suspended then-US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Facebook and Instagram accounts following his praise for people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Facebook, Trump's last post was from January 6 and reads, "I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law &amp; Order &ndash; respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being removed from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter Trump created his own social media network, Truth Social, and has not yet become active on the sites that have reinstated him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepoliticalinsider.com/non-binary-god-the-church-of-england-considers-making-language-in-scripture-gender-neutral/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepoliticalinsider.com/non-binary-god-the-church-of-england-considers-making-language-in-scripture-gender-neutral/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the name of the Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit&hellip;Amen; At least it is for now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Church of England is studying and deliberating on possibly changing the language of scripture to be gender-neutral.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welby's Church of England will begin using pronouns that are "gender neutral" in reference to God.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When referring to God in some prayers, the male pronouns 'He' and 'Him' will be eliminated, and the phrase "our Father" will be omitted from the beginning of the Lord's Prayer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument that God shouldn&rsquo;t be referred to in masculine terms is not new. One only has to remember the 1999 movie &lsquo;Dogma&rsquo; starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as fallen angels that depicted God as a woman played by not-ironic at-all Alanis Morrissette.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An argument by many on the left side of this argument claim that referring to God as exclusively male is what drives a lot of discrimination and sexism against women. Add to that the recent surge in gender ideology that you can identify as any number of over 50 genders; the scripture gets even more complicated for the left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this societal fad, Rev. Joanna Stobart from the Diocese of Bath and Wells has asked the Church of England to &ldquo;develop more inclusive language in our authorized liturgy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reverend is asking the Church to &ldquo;provide more options for those who wish to use authorized liturgy and speak of God in a non-gendered way, particularly, in authorized absolutions where many of the prayers offered for use refer to God using male pronouns.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not everyone sees this issue the same way, thank God.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/09/missouri-rejects-ban-children-carrying-guns-in-public"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/09/missouri-rejects-ban-children-carrying-guns-in-public</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri votes against banning children from carrying guns in public</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican-led Missouri state house on Wednesday voted against banning minors from openly carrying firearms on public land without adult supervision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal to ban children from carrying guns without adult supervision in public failed by a 104-39 vote. Only one Republican voted in support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Democrat, Donna Baringer, said police in her district asked for the change to stop &ldquo;14-year-olds walking down the middle of the street in the city of St Louis carrying AR-15s&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Missouri lawmakers repealed concealed carry requirements in most situations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure was part of an hours-long debate on the best way to fight crime, particularly in the St Louis area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Lane Roberts &ndash; a former Joplin, Missouri, police chief and state public safety director &ndash; initially included the restrictions on children possessing guns in a broader crime bill, which the House voted to give initial approval. But lawmakers on a House committee that Roberts leads stripped the provision on guns last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other provisions in the measure would allow the governor to appoint a special prosecutor in counties with high crime rates, a provision targeted at the St Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Gaetz Introduces Resolution to END Financial Aid to Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution also calls for a peace agreement after almost a year-long war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaetz and ten co-sponsors introduced the &ldquo;Ukraine Fatigue Resolution,&rdquo; which calls for the U.S. to &ldquo;end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Fox News reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution notes that since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort, with more than $110 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally. It includes more than $27.4 billion in security assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Daily Fetched reported last month, the total amount of military aid provided to Kyiv from the United States has soared past $26 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, Antony Blinken announced a further $2.5 billion in military aid for Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the $2.5 billion for Ukraine, congress already awarded $45 billion to the country in the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill, which was signed into law in December 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,&rdquo; Biden said, making that announcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News also notes that the resolution lists the enormous amount of equipment that the U.S. has provided to the country since the beginning of the conflict. It also cites Pentagon officials who have said the munitions have &ldquo;severely depleted United States stockpiles, weakening United States readiness in the event of conflict.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also claims that by providing assistance, the U.S. is inadvertently contributing to civilian casualties, and notes the U.S. estimates that 40,000 civilians had died in the conflict.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concern about the continued U.S. funding of the war has grown among a subset of Republicans as the conflict has dragged on, with lawmakers highlighting issues at home that could use additional funding &ndash; including what they see as a failure to protect the U.S. border against a historic migrant crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Gaetz said the U.S. has been the top contributor to an &ldquo;everlasting conflict.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In Chapters 5 and 6 of Paradise Restored, David Chilton discusses the importance, and the biblical theology, of animals, trees, and land. Modern Christianity often has a worldview that more closely resembles Gnosticism, being skeptical of property and physical blessings. But everything God creates and gives to His people are a lesson about how to live and take dominion in God&rsquo;s world.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-wants-downed-spy-aircraft-back-does-not-belong-to-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-wants-downed-spy-aircraft-back-does-not-belong-to-us</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China wants its downed spy aircraft back, saying it 'does not belong to the US'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People's Republic of China is requesting the return of its surveillance aircraft after the balloon was shot down over the continental United States on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning fielded questions Tuesday about the incident, which dominated news cycles and commanded attention from U.S. politicians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked for additional information regarding the purpose of the spy balloon and reports of similar aircraft making routes through North American and South American airspace, Mao declined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Chinese side has given information about the unmanned airship on several occasions. I don&rsquo;t have anything to add at the moment," she stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon said it "acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information" from the spy platform. But geopolitical experts said there is little reason to believe those efforts were successful as the balloon almost certainly transferred surveillance data over to China as it flew over several military bases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if China has requested that the debris from the destroyed aircraft be returned, Mao said Tuesday, "The airship does not belong to the U.S. It belongs to China."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mao reiterated in her Tuesday press conference the Chinese Communist Party's claim that the balloon was civilian in nature and criticized the U.S. government for not acting in a "calm and professional manner."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naftali Bennett, then the prime minister of Israel, found himself praying aboard a cramped, decrepit plane last year as it sailed over Kazakhstan. The long flight, arranged with help from the Mossad, was bound for Moscow on a desperate mission: broker peace between Russia and Ukraine just after the two countries had gone to war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bennett, Russian President Vladimir Putin made two major concessions during their March 5 meeting. First, he renounced &ldquo;denazification&rdquo;&mdash;that is, regime change in Kiev. Second, he dropped his demand for Ukraine&rsquo;s demilitarization. Bennett said President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to abandon Ukraine&rsquo;s pursuit of NATO membership in exchange. Both Putin and Zelensky seemed eager to end the fighting. But the U.S. had other plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett said a &ldquo;decision by the West&rdquo; was made &ldquo;to keep striking Putin&rdquo; through Ukraine. &ldquo;They blocked it and I thought they were wrong,&rdquo; he said. Bennett noted that the governments of Germany and France were pragmatic toward the idea compared to the U.S. and the U.K., which took a more belligerent attitude against Russia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the U.K. is little more than a neutered lapdog of D.C., it is more than likely that it was the U.S. who decided to keep the war going. Indeed, Bennett said he deferred &ldquo;to America in this regard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with author and comedian Hanoch Daum, Bennett provided a behind-the-scenes look at his efforts to establish a ceasefire and how it initially showed promise until being doomed by imperial intrigue. It was the first time time he talked about his attempt to mediate peace between the two countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His solution was &ldquo;creating contact with both sides and trying to mediate,&rdquo; leveraging his good relations with Putin and Zelensky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett maintained contact with the governments of Germany, France, the U.K., and the U.S. throughout the negotiations, keeping them appraised as talks, mostly by phone, progressed. While Putin was open to diplomacy, the U.S. was not, according to Bennett.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett described Putin as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Messianic&rdquo; but governed by limited, concrete objectives, contra the Western portrait of him as a madman bent on world domination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putin does not think of himself as an imperialist, Bennett said, but as someone fighting against imperialism in the form of NATO expansionism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone, maybe Mark Twain, said that history doesn&rsquo;t repeat, but it does rhyme. What Bennett revealed is a reminder that the U.S. has been calling the war tune for decades.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Sues Biden Admin Over &lsquo;Pharmacy Mandate&rsquo; to Dispense Abortion Drugs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration on Tuesday to block federal health guidance that allegedly forces pharmacies to dispense abortion-inducing drugs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration in July 2022 released guidance requiring pharmacies to supply women with abortion-inducing drugs or risk losing Medicaid and Medicare funds, even if certain state laws prohibit the procedure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas argues in its lawsuit, which refers to the guidance collectively as the &ldquo;pharmacy mandate,&rdquo; that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has attempted to impose, via executive fiat, a federal right to abortion. The lawsuit said this was a part of the Biden administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;war against&rdquo; the Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health decision. That ruling reversed a 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;But whether the Biden Administration likes it or not, the question of abortion is up to the people&rsquo;s elected representatives&mdash;not unelected bureaucrats,&rdquo; the lawsuit states (pdf). &ldquo;The Biden Administration&rsquo;s attempt to inject itself into that question is both procedurally and substantively illegal.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HHS guidance, which involved roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies, claims that federal anti-discrimination law requires pharmacies to provide these drugs. The guidance was released on July 13, 2022, a few days after President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed an executive order that made it easier to obtain abortion services following the Dobbs decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, argues that Title IX&rsquo;s anti-discrimination protections don&rsquo;t require companies to provide abortions, and instead protect any person or entity from being forced to aid in the provision of abortions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Paxton&rsquo;s office, the alleged HHS assertion that federal anti-discrimination law mandates every pharmacy to provide abortion drugs is &ldquo;patently false.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxton further argues that the Supreme Court returned the power to decide on abortion law back to the states, instead of the federal government. The &ldquo;pharmacy mandate,&rdquo; therefore, preempts certain state laws, which prohibit pharmacies from providing abortion-inducing drugs, and goes against the Dobbs decision, according to Paxton.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original copy of the HHS guidance document published in July 2022 is not currently available on the department&rsquo;s website, but a version archived on Jan. 23, 2023 can still be accessed (pdf).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance reminds approximately 60,000 retail pharmacies and their employees of their obligation &ldquo;under federal civil rights laws&rdquo; to ensure access to prescription medication.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HHS said in the guidance that among its civil rights enforcement responsibilities, its Office for Civil Rights is responsible for &ldquo;protecting the rights of women and pregnant people in their ability to access care that is free from discrimination.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of discrimination include denying a prescription for medication to assist with a miscarriage and denying medication for a disability, according to the guidance.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could Chicago be about to elect a pro-life, pro-cop Democratic mayor?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago&rsquo;s next mayoral election is quickly approaching, scheduled for the 28th of this month. Most of the polls indicate that the incumbent mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is not doing well and she might not be given another term. That wouldn&rsquo;t be a terribly surprising result, given the soaring crime rates and the generally decrepit state of the Windy City these days. If that&rsquo;s the case, who will replace her? Interestingly enough, one of the current frontrunners is a man named Paul Vallas. What makes him unique among Chicago Democrats is his history of being opposed to abortion and his promises to crack down on crime. But can someone like that really be elected in a liberal stronghold? (ABC7 Chicago)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago mayoral candidates are touting dueling endorsements as Paul Vallas comes under fire for his Democratic credentials and past statements opposing abortion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several recent polls suggest Vallas is one of the frontrunners in the mayor&rsquo;s race, so it&rsquo;s no surprise he&rsquo;s coming under attack, but it&rsquo;s also an indication that this race will be rough and tumble in its final three weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the other candidates, Jesus &ldquo;Chuy&rdquo; Garcia, has been running attack ads against Vallas. He dug up a clip from some years ago where Vallas describes himself as &ldquo;more of a Republican than a Democrat&rdquo; and saying that he&rsquo;s personally opposed to abortion. Garcia is accusing him of not being a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Democrat and claims that Vallas would be &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; for Chicago. Really? More dangerous than, say&hellip; stopping your car at a red light for more than ten seconds?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vallas has now received the endorsement of both the Chicago Tribune and the Fraternal Order of Police, which is rather remarkable. The Chicago Sun-Times has run a number of articles on this Vallas, listing all of the progressive liberals who are losing their minds about him. They&rsquo;re accusing him of having trodden upon the rights of workers in previous positions he&rsquo;s held and wanting to outlaw abortions. There are probably a couple of them calling him a satan worshipper by now. In other words, all of the right people hate him.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earthquake Death Toll Passes 7,200 as Turkey Experiences 285 Aftershocks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll from the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have exceeded 7,200, with thousands more injured, infrastructure crumbling, and rescue groups struggling to bring aid to the victims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Turkey, at least 5,434 people are confirmed dead. In Syria, state news agency SANA reported at least 1,832 deaths. Combined, at least 7,266 people have died in Turkey and Syria.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, at least 3,749 people are estimated to have been injured in Syria. Turkey&rsquo;s injured are estimated to be over 30,000. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the death toll could rise to around 20,000 in the coming days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quake, with an epicenter in the Pazarcik district of Turkey&rsquo;s southern Province, had a magnitude of 7.8. A second quake of 7.6 magnitude hit the same region nine hours later, worsening the situation. Turkey experienced 285 aftershocks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. President Joe Biden &ldquo;noted that U.S. teams are deploying quickly to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and coordinate other assistance that may be required by people affected by the earthquakes, including health services or basic relief items,&rdquo; a readout of Biden&rsquo;s conversation with Turkish President on Jan. 6 said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earthquakes have caused widespread devastation in Turkey. A video shared on Twitter shows innumerable buildings turned to rubble, with only a few tall buildings still standing. Another video shows a building crashing down while people run for safety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Turkey&rsquo;s southern region, which is home to some of the worst-hit cities, damaged roads and poor internet connections are hampering rescue attempts. In some places, freezing winter weather is also posing a challenge. Families were forced to sleep in cars lined up in the streets. Families wrapped themselves in blankets and gathered around fires to keep themselves warm. The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency of Turkey (AFAD) is said to have deployed 13,740 search and rescue personnel as well as over 300,000 blankets, 100,000 beds, and 41,000 tents to the region. According to Organ Tatar, an official from AFAD, 5,775 buildings have been destroyed by the quake.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The infrastructure is damaged, the roads that we used to use for humanitarian work are damaged, we have to be creative in how to get to the people &hellip;&nbsp; but we are working hard,&rdquo; U.N. resident coordinator&nbsp; -told Reuters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earthquake on Monday is Turkey&rsquo;s deadliest since a quake of similar magnitude hit the country in 1999 and killed over 17,000 people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massive Human Trafficking Bust Sees 368 Arrested, 131 Rescued in California</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three hundred sixty-eight people have been arrested, and 131 victims rescued in large-scale human trafficking operation by a multi-agency task force in California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Michel Moore said: &ldquo;We know that the sex trade is a prolific one that exists throughout this state and throughout our nation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ugly scar against this great country that exists too oftentimes in plain sight,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Reclaim and Rebuild occurred between Jan. 22 and Jan. 28 in nine counties, including Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino, Kiro7 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies teamed up for the effort, including the LAPD, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victims of human trafficking, including ages ranging from 13 to 52, including children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators worked with victim advocacy groups to provide resources &ldquo;to help [victims] escape from this life-threatening environment,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators responded to advertisements offering sexual services and visited massage parlors suspected of being involved in sex trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those arrested included pimps and panderers, Moore said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victims, most of whom were kidnapped, face &ldquo;threat of death&rdquo; or coercion and are isolated from their former support to become dependent on the trafficker, Moore added.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Death tourism': Oregon becomes national destination for assisted suicide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals residing in states that outlaw euthanasia, such as Texas, have started traveling to Oregon to gain assistance in their suicide, making the state the first "death tourism" destination in the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, Dr. Nicholas Gideonse, the director of End of Life Choices Oregon, recently admitted to assisting a man from Texas with Lou Gehrig's disease who came to the doctor's Portland clinic in achieving suicide and said that "for a small number of patients who otherwise qualify or are determined to go through that and who have the energy and the resources &hellip; it has started to happen."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Oregon's official website, the state passed its Death with Dignity Act in 1997, "which allows terminally ill individuals to end their lives through the voluntary self-administration of lethal medications, expressly prescribed by a physician for that purpose." The law enabled terminally ill patients expected to die within six months to request fatal drugs from doctors that the patient then takes and self-administers. In 2021, 238 people committed suicide via the program, and 383 doses of fatal drugs were prescribed by doctors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was originally a restriction for people out-of-state but in 2021 Dr. Gideonse sued Oregon to lift the restriction, which was granted in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, if a resident from another state wants to go to Oregon for the fatal drugs, they are placed on a 15-day waiting period. In that time paperwork is processed and two doctors along with witnesses must sign off on the request for suicide by prescription. The expansion of Death with Dignity to out-of-staters is not yet law in Oregon but is expected to be codified this year with House Bill 2279.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law resembles Canada's state-sponsored euthanasia program known as medical assistance in dying (MAiD), originally intended for those with physical illnesses where death was a reasonable inevitability although it has been amended to allow those with mental health issues to apply.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gideonse's original lawsuit was over neighboring residents of Washington who wanted suicide drugs and has expanded to residents from further states, including those with strict laws against euthanasia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive director of the Patients Rights Action Fund, a group pushing back against Oregon's law, Matt Valli&egrave;re, said "You end up in this Wild West scenario where people take the drugs back to their home states, and there are a lot more questions than there are answers about what would happen after that."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gideonse, who also has campaigned for legalizing psilocybin to treat depression, has connections with the Compassion &amp; Choices group which "grew out of the 1980s right-to-die movement of the Hemlock Society and Jack Kevorkian &mdash; the pathologist and notorious 'Dr Death' who assisted scores of suicides and was ultimately convicted of murder," reports the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tucker Carlson &amp; Charles Camosy spoke on this very subject.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Study Could Be 'Scientific Nail in the Coffin' for Masks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the largest and most comprehensive studies on the effectiveness of masks found they do almost nothing to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study reviewed 78 randomized control trials&mdash;experiments that have long been considered "the gold standard" for medicine&mdash;which assessed the effectiveness of face masks against flu, COVID-19, and similar illnesses. It found that wearing masks "probably makes little or no difference" for the general public, no matter what kind of mask is used. Even N95 masks, considered the most effective at filtering airborne particles, showed no clear benefit for health care workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study was published on January 30 by the Cochrane Library, a world-renowned medical database that is famous for its high-quality evidence reviews. It comes as a battering ram to the recommendations of the U.S. public health establishment, which urged children as young as two to wear masks throughout the pandemic.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<main class="main-content col-lg-9" role="main">
<article>
<p>Idolatry takes any number of forms at the individual, church, and national levels, but its temptation is always the same: you shall be as God. And the results always lead to death. As churches capitulate to antichristian cultural pressures, they often keep their outward form, but lose the power and vitality that ought to sustain and animate them. The Lord reserved some of His hardest words for those who led their people in this apostate way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 2,300 dead after devastating earthquake, aftershocks in Turkey and Syria</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll has surpassed 2,300 after a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Turkey and Syria around 4:17 am on Monday. Both countries have declared a state of emergency as rescue efforts move to find survivors trapped under rubble, reports the Times of Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck a few minutes later at 4:24 am approximately 60 miles north of the first quake's epicenter, which was centered in the southeastern province of Gaziantep, Turkey, according to the Daily Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quake's depth was up to 10 miles according to the US Geological Survey and had aftershocks reaching 6.7 on the Richter Scale. Tremors reverberated as far away as Israel and Cairo in Egypt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS reports that UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said "We stand ready to provide further support as needed." A total of 76 search and rescue specialists have been dispatched from the UK to help with the efforts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost immediately after the quake hit, Turkey asked the European Civil Project and Humanitarian Aid Operations for assistance and aid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Turkish Interior Minister said, "The main impact of the earthquake fell on Kahramanmaras. After that, there were at least 22 aftershocks, 6 of magnitude over 6. The earthquake was felt in 10 provinces</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Two hours after the earthquake, several dozen dead are known. In many cities, multi-storey buildings have been destroyed; it is not yet possible to start clearing the rubble."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/prostitutes-sex-workers-catholic-school-oakland"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/prostitutes-sex-workers-catholic-school-oakland</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prostitutes solicit sex right outside Catholic elementary school, police handcuffed after California Democrats passed law to protect transgender sex workers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents of children are up in arms that prostitutes are soliciting sex work right outside a California elementary school. Some are saying that a law passed by California Democrats has handcuffed law enforcement in cracking down on sex workers selling their bodies in broad daylight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGO-TV conducted an investigation about prostitutes working outside St. Anthony's elementary school in East Oakland. The San Francisco-based news station captured video of sex workers dressed in minimal clothes and stiletto heels walking the streets near the Catholic school to sell their bodies in the middle of the day with students nearby.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGO-TV reported, "The I-Team captured videos along E. 15th Street outside the school gate on four different dates over the past couple weeks showing young women wearing barely any clothing walking along the school sidewalk, the street corners, or directly across from the school. All of the videos were captured as children were being dropped off or walked into school."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerned parent Rosa Vargas told KGO-TV said she sees prostitutes near the Catholic school "every day, during all periods of the day."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vargas said the sex workers solicit sex so close to the elementary school that they recently "were blocking the entrance of the parking structure" of the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo noted that he is receiving complaints about prostitutes every week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallo stated, "I get the call saying, 'Mr. Gallo I can't get into my home because the pimp is blocking my driveway.' It's constant."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallo said he has seen up to 20 scantily-clad women walking up and down the street, appearing to engage in prostitution. He revealed that some of the girls are as young as 15 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials believe some of the women are victims of human trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some believe that recent construction along a busy highway caused the sex workers to migrate to residential neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodney Pierre-Antoine &ndash; who oversees seven Catholic elementary schools, including St. Anthony's &ndash; said the hands of the police "are somewhat handcuffed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierre-Antoine is referencing Senate Bill 357, known as the Safer Streets for All Act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 357 states:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing law prohibits soliciting or engaging in an act of prostitution, as specified. Existing law also prohibits loitering in a public place with the intent to commit prostitution, as defined, or directing, supervising, recruiting, or aiding a person who is loitering with the intent to commit prostitution, or collecting or receiving all or part of the proceeds of an act of prostitution. Under existing law, a violation of any of these provisions is a misdemeanor. This bill would repeal those provisions related to loitering with the intent to commit prostitution and would make other conforming changes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed SB 357 into law in July, and it went into effect on Jan. 1.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers told KGO-TV that the new law is prohibiting them from rescuing women who they believe are victims of human trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/democrat-led-state-killing-businesses-shrink-secede-several-counties"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/democrat-led-state-killing-businesses-shrink-secede-several-counties</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat-led state that&rsquo;s &lsquo;killing businesses&rsquo; could shrink amid push to secede in several counties</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 11 Oregon counties approved a preliminary vote to secede from the Democrat-led state, local leaders around the movement are explaining how the urban-rural divide has left them with no other choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People in eastern Oregon have felt like their state-level governance has not heard them, has not paid attention to our concerns, and has not been working for eastern Oregon," Greater Idaho Movement spokesperson Matt McCaw said on "Fox &amp; Friends First" Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCaw, along with Oregon business owner Sandie Gilson, supports the idea of having select counties elect to move their state borderlines so state-level governance would come from Idaho.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last two years, the Greater Idaho Movement has worked to gather constituent sentiment around the proposal. Business owners like Gilson sounded off on Oregon&rsquo;s tax policy, detailing the burden taken on by a corporate activity tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to secede from the state, McCaw argued, would be a "win-win" for all involved parties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formal state bill, called the Greater Idaho Bill, was introduced to the Oregon legislature on Jan. 10.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho state leaders reportedly motioned for formal discussions about the proposal last week, noting the purpose is to "begin official discussions on whether it is feasible to move the Idaho border into eastern Oregon."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if Idaho and Oregon were to negotiate a border adjustment, U.S. Congress would have to sign off on it, in addition to both Oregon and Idaho legislatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan would create what would become the nation&rsquo;s third-largest state geographically.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2023/02/06/study-five-months-late-night-93-liberal-guests-1-conservative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2023/02/06/study-five-months-late-night-93-liberal-guests-1-conservative</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Months Of Late Night: 93 Liberal Guests, 1 Conservative</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The late-night comedy shows ended 2022 with a unanimously liberal guest count and that trend continued until the very last day of January, a NewsBusters study has revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRC analysts found that from Labor Day through January 31, liberal guests outnumbered conservative guests 93 to 1. It was 99 percent liberal and/or Democrat. The one exception was My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell who Jimmy Kimmel put on to mock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is follow up to MRC&rsquo;s late night guest election campaign study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study looked at the daily six late night comedy shows: ABC&rsquo;s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, NBC&rsquo;s Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, CBS&rsquo;s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden, and Comedy Central&rsquo;s The Daily Show with Trevor Noah and 2023 temp hosts. Fox's Gutfeld! was not included.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRC analysts divided guests into two categories: partisan officials and then journalists and celebrities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to the count of politicians, the count was 27 Democrats to 0 Republicans. Stephen Colbert led with ten, Noah was second with seven, Meyers was third at four, Fallon came in fourth with three, Kimmel placed fifth at two, and Corden was sixth and last with one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, and former First Lady Michelle Obama were the guests who appeared multiple times during the length of the study. Obama's appearance on Colbert was split into multiple episodes and is counted as multiple appearances and was the only guest to appear three times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for journalists and celebrities, the results were 66 liberals to 1 conservative. Stephen Colbert was again the most partisan with 21. Trevor Noah and The Daily Show temp hosts came in second at 17 (11 for Noah, 1 for Leslie Jones, 2 for Wanda Sykes, 3 for D.L. Hughley). Meyers and Fallon tied for bronze with ten. Kimmel again placed fifth with seven and Corden was the least partisan with one.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese spy balloon carried explosives to self-detonate</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon over the weekend, Pentagon officials have revealed that the balloon potentially was carrying explosives to destroy itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, Air Force Gen. Glen D. VanHerck, commander of US Northern Command, revealed in a Monday call with reporters that the Balloon, in addition to potentially carrying explosives, was 200 feet tall, weighed thousands of pounds, and its payload was the size of a jetliner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v28clmv-the-chinese-spy-balloon-has-finally-been-shot-down..html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v28clmv-the-chinese-spy-balloon-has-finally-been-shot-down..html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanHerck&rsquo;s comments came following a briefing by National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, who defended Biden&rsquo;s decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until the weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the coast of South Carolina on Saturday afternoon, the US military, using an F-22 fighter jet, shot down the balloon with a missile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly before the balloon was shot down, Federal Aviation Administration had issued a ground stop for three airports in the Carolinas located in Wilmington, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balloon had entered US airspace on January 28 and was known to the Biden administration for nearly a week before its report in the news on Thursday, February 2. The White House reportedly tried to keep its presence secret to not disrupt Secretary of State Antony Blinken scheduled trip to China, which was postponed after the public's discovery of the balloon.</span></p>

   <title><![CDATA[Having Two Legs: Table Fellowship [Pastor Toby’s Blog]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/da27a960-2d07-46cd-9bf6-f44c90f61ed8/having-two-legs-table-fellowship.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Table Fellowship</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a table of communion and fellowship. This is why we call it Communion. It is communion with God, and it is communion with God&rsquo;s people. This is why Paul told the Corinthians that when they came together to eat this meal it was not really the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. There were divisions among the Corinthians, rivalries, resentments, and elbows being thrown. You can&rsquo;t celebrate communion while being out of communion with God or your neighbor. It says that when the Corinthians tried to do that many of them got sick and some had even died.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the Old Testament, when the Israelites complained against God that there was no meat to eat in the wilderness, He gave them quail, but that meat became poison to all those with evil hearts. Likewise, God told Israel that if a man suspected his wife of adultery, he could bring her to the tabernacle and the priest could give her a drink that would function as a jealousy test. In some ways, this table functions like that. If you are in fellowship with God and one another, this bread and cup are grace and strength and blessing. But if you come to this table harboring secret sins, or grievances or out of fellowship with someone, you need to know that by eating and drinking, you are inviting Christ in. Christ is here, and this is communion with Christ. But if you eat and drink communion while trying to preserve disunion, divisions, and strife, this meal will be a curse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The answer is not to abstain from this table. If you are baptized, you really must come. Don&rsquo;t cling to your sin and abstain from the meal. Rather, let go of your sin now. Drop your sin now. Determine in your heart right now to kill that sin, to confess it, to forsake it, to be reconciled to your brother or sister as soon as possible. If you do that, then this meal will strengthen you for that fight, strengthen you to do what needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">So look around as you share this meal. Smile at your wife, your husband, your kids, your parents, your roommates, your friends. Is all well? Or do you need to lean over and whisper an apology and forgiveness to someone? Do it. This is communion. This is the communion of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose blood reconciles every sin. So come and welcome to Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span class="S1PPyQ">Legislation in multiple states will take on the issue of gender affirming care. Christians will support it and not realize that the reasons given for it deny the existence of any real law. This means real parental rights can no longer be based on real law. That leaves cancel culture in driver&rsquo;s seat to cancel the parental rights and civil liberties that Christian so greatly prize. Welcome to world Rousseau&rsquo;s civil religion created when the evangelical gospel went Gnostic!</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antifa claims responsibility for attack on far-left Portland bar in retaliation for them 'spreading Covid' by staying open</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Rose City Antifa have taken credit for vandalism that occurred at a worker-owned Portland Bar in the early hours of January 29.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a "communique" posted to Rose City Counter-Info on January 31, the group stated that the vandalism, carried out by "disabled anarchists," targeted the Worker&rsquo;s Tap because of "how this bar inherently operates with unmitigated COVID spread."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In the early hours of January 29th, some disabled anarchist attacked Worker&rsquo;s Tap by tagging it and damaging a window. Due to the bullet-proof glass, the window&rsquo;s damage would only consist of small dents," the statement read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group said that phrases and symbols like the anarchist "A," and "161" which calls out "that it was fascists forces whom originally paved the path of COVID as a genocide since April 2020 through the blood of primarily Black and Indigenous disabled people, a road of bones which now many liberals and ableist anarchists goose-stomp on in collaboration with the fascists to maintain a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for keeping bars and other viral-friendly entertainment operating at the expense of disabled lives."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the bar was tagged with "Covid Kills!" twice "to address how this bar inherently operates with unmitigated COVID spread, murdering disabled people in the process."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement continued on to say that the act was carried out in "retaliation" to the "event organizers in the anarchist scene who contribute to the COVID pandemic by organizing super-spreader gatherings that, in the end, lead to more disabled people dying."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Multnomah County, where Portland is located, the number of new Covid-19 cases has remained under 1,000 since July. The most recent data shows that in the last full week of January, there were just 275 cases. 31 of those cases required hospitalization. This is down from a spike seen over the summer, with 3,180 cases recorded, and dramatically lower than the omicron spike seen last winter, with 11,373 cases being recorded at its peak, according to county data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Worker&rsquo;s Tap, the bar targeted by the vandalism, is a worker-owned and operated beer bar in Portland, Oregon. The bar required proof of vaccination to enter the establishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to its website, "Our business is run democratically and profits are split amongst our members."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilhan Omar REMOVED from Foreign Affairs Committee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, who has a long history of anti-Semitic remarks, was removed from her position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a 218 to 2011 party-line vote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Correspondent Chad Pergram tweeted, "The House has voted to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) from the Foreign Affairs Committee. The vote was 218 to 211 with one member voting 'present.'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he intended to remove Omar due to her history of antisemitic comments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries acknowledged this history on Thursday and said, "Rep. Omar certainly has made mistakes. She has used antisemitic tropes."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omer was elected to Congress in 2018, and in her long history of using antisemitic tropes has compared the boycotting of the Jewish state of Israel to the boycotting of Nazis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A move to remove Omar began in 2021 after the Democrat-led Congress removed GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a press conference that the removal was a "political stunt" and a "disservice to the American people."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on the House floor "this is about targeting women of color" and slammed her notepad on the lecturn.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Omar out, but Biden's Top Economic Advisor Is Out</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden announced Thursday morning his top economic advisor, Brian Deese, is leaving his position at the White House. Deese served as Biden's National Economic Council Director since taking office in January 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deese's departure comes as economists warn the U.S. is headed into a recession this year. As the head of the NEC, Deese repeatedly claimed Biden's inflation crisis was transitory and advocated for massive federal government spending by Democrats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS' Margaret Brennan pressed Deese over Biden's lie that inflation was "transitory" and solely due to Putin's war:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender Inmate Who Committed Kidnapping, Murder Transferred to Women&rsquo;s Prison</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A biological male prisoner who began identifying as a transgender woman and has a history of violence against women was reportedly transferred from a men&rsquo;s prison in Kansas to a women&rsquo;s prison this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inmate, who was known as Thomas Lamb, was convicted of kidnapping and killing a young woman in 1969 and kidnapping a second woman in 1970, according to News13. In 2007, Thomas Lamb changed his name to &ldquo;Michelle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years that followed, Lamb reportedly requested to be moved to a women&rsquo;s facility. This request, however, was denied. But, records obtained by News13 show that Lamb was moved to a women&rsquo;s prison this month (via News 13):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, a U.S. District Court ruled against Lamb in a lawsuit asking the state to transfer HIM to an all-female facility, and allow him to pursue gender re-assignment surgery. An Appeals Court upheld the ruling in 2018, stating that, although it was not the treatment Lamb might want, evidence showed he was being provided treatment for gender dysphoria, and the state was not showing &ldquo;deliberate indifference&rdquo; to his situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Kansas Dept. of Corrections records show he was transferred Jan. 27 to Topeka Correctional Facility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is not known if Lamb will now be allowed to go forward with the gender reassignment surgery, 13 NEWS asked KDOC public affairs director Randall Bowman whether the state would pay for the procedure if he did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowman would not comment on Lamb&rsquo;s case specifically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Healthcare decisions are not made by KDOC officials,&rdquo; Bowman said. &ldquo;Due to patient privacy concerns, KDOC and the Governor&rsquo;s Office cannot comment on the specifics of medical care for any one individual.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Brady Announces His Retirement &lsquo;For Good&rsquo; From The NFL</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brady, 45, is widely considered the best to ever play his position and potentially the greatest NFL star of all time, following a 23-year career that saw him go to 15 Pro Bowls and win five league MVP awards. His accolades are so far-reaching that his name fills the record books. He leaves the game as its all-time leader in completions (7,753), yards (89, 214), and touchdowns (649).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning six titles playing for Coach Bill Belichick in New England, Brady mulled retirement before signing with Tampa Bay in 2020. He would go on to win his seventh Super Bowl in his first year for the Buccaneers. There, he would be reunited with his old Patriot partner in crime, Rob Gronkowski.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately for Brady and the Bucs, the last two seasons have been a bit of a downward spiral. They captured the woeful NFC South. But at 8-9, they didn&rsquo;t look like they had a prayer of advancing in the postseason. They were bounced by the Dallas Cowboys in the opening round, 31-14, the team looked old and tired, even their forever-young signal caller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brady certainly was no slouch during the regular season. He still threw for threw for 4694&nbsp; yards and 25 touchdowns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he already (half-heartedly) put off retirement last year to return for one more round. He famously announced he was quitting, had a flirtation with joining the Miami Dolphins organization, and then finally acquiesced to returning to Tampa for 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the fatigue and frustration were already there. And the whispers grew into full-fledged gossip as the season progressed: This looked more and more like it was Tom Brady&rsquo;s final season. At least in Tampa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he&rsquo;s confirmed that he won&rsquo;t be playing for anyone in 2023. Brady is, as he puts it into his own words, retiring &ldquo;for good&rdquo; this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his farewell video, the future NFL Hall of Famer was (as usual) reserved and reminiscent. Like so many of his famous fourth-quarter comebacks, he tried to stay calm and cool in the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Tom Brady couldn&rsquo;t hide a hint of emotion as he bid farewell to those who helped him on his epic journey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When his story is eventually written, Brady&rsquo;s will be about an unlikely hero who rose to the level of royalty. He ascended to heights never before reached, all while coming from nearly the bottom of the heap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was famously picked 199th overall in the 2000 draft by the Patriots, behind six other quarterbacks. During his rookie campaign, he played in only one game and didn&rsquo;t exactly look like a future great: The University of Michigan product finished the season having only gone one-for-three for six yards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2001, a serious injury to franchise quarterback Drew Bledsoe would necessitate the start of the Brady Era in New England.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What followed was the greatest run that any quarterback, head coach, or franchise would ever embark on in NFL history. After upsetting the dominant St. Louis Rams and &lsquo;The Greatest Show on Turf&rsquo; in Super Bowl XXXVI the next 17 years were like a whirlwind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What New England was able to accomplish in the 2000s and 2010s not only superseded anything ever seen in the NFL, it rivaled storied franchises from any sport and any era. The Murderers&rsquo; Row Yankees of 1920s Major League Baseball or the NHL&rsquo;s Montreal Canadiens from the 1950s-70s come to mind&hellip; but that&rsquo;s about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers alone put up by Brady and his teams over the years is astronomical. When Joe Montana retired as the gold standard of Super Bowl QBs, he had four rings. TB12 has almost twice that many. And he&rsquo;s played in a whopping TEN title games. The ability to stay healthy and play that well for so many years will likely never be seen by sports fans&rsquo; eyes again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say that Brady&rsquo;s departure from a league where he will always be a figurehead is hard to overstate. His mark on the NFL and the game of football is unparalleled. And his track record of winning is nearly unfathomable. His road to Canton is literally paved in gold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of his successors in signal calling, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said about the G.O.A.T., &ldquo;It&rsquo;s special to see the things he has done in this league. The way he was able to change the position &mdash; the longevity of great success. That&rsquo;s the crazy part: looking at his career, he has never really had a down year.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, it&rsquo;s Friday&hellip; How about a quick feel-good story heading into your weekend?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conservativereview.com/amazon-driver-risks-his-own-safety-to-rescue-dog-from-burning-car-2659365675.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.conservativereview.com/amazon-driver-risks-his-own-safety-to-rescue-dog-from-burning-car-2659365675.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon driver risks his own safety to rescue dog from burning car</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Amazon driver with a history of helping others while on his route came to the rescue once again when he recently helped spring a dog that had become trapped inside a burning vehicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the evening of January 23, Ervin Ruhe, a 49-year-old Amazon driver, was heading home after a long day at work. He had just assisted a colleague finish his deliveries when he spotted a car on fire on the side of the road in Merced, about 40 minutes outside his hometown of Modesto, California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruhe spotted a man guiding his wife away from the burning vehicle and stopped to see whether he could help. Ruhe described the man &mdash; who, by that time, had returned to the vehicle and had begun attempting to open one of the car doors &mdash; as "distressed," so Ruhe pulled over and quickly grabbed the emergency fire extinguisher located in the back of his delivery van.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It didn&rsquo;t look like it was too bad yet, but I was just hoping nobody was inside," Ruhe later recalled. "I just wanted to try and help out if I was able to."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruhe began immediately dousing the flames with the fire extinguisher when the couple apprised him of their main concern. "Our dog&rsquo;s inside," one of them shouted, "our dog&rsquo;s inside!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, a small chihuahua was trapped in the back seat of the vehicle. Ruhe managed to contain the fire enough to unlock the back door so that the man could open it and bring the little pooch to safety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all creatures, great and small, were out of danger, Ruhe called 911 and took a quick video of the burning car.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Liberty Dispatch ~ February 2, 2023</p>
<p>In this episode, Matty and Andrew discuss the continued media lies and delusions concerning COVID, the actual truth about the virus and the vaccines, and the amazing about-face by many formerly pro-lockdown doctors and medical professionals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Ban China from Buying US Farmland</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and John Tester (D-Mont.) on Feb. 1 introduced a bill to ban China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea from buying or leasing U.S. farmland and agricultural businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed legislation, named the PASS (Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security) Act of 2023, would require the president to report to Congress on any waiver granted to the prohibited countries. It would also make the secretary of agriculture a standing member of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a federal panel that reviews foreign acquisitions for national security risks, and specify agricultural investments as falling under CFIUS&rsquo; jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the legislation is the same as a version introduced last year, Rounds said that this year&rsquo;s bill has more bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress and support from stakeholders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The intent behind this particular legislation was to prohibit China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from establishing locations in the United States where they could monitor activity, specifically potential military activity,&rdquo; said Rounds in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rounds highlighted the value of farming and seed technology developed in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;China has an interest in taking some of our advancements and using them in their country without acknowledging the patents that may accompany that material, which is made easier if they have a base of operation in the United States in which to obtain the material in the first place,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third-generation Montana farmer, Tester said in a statement that he was proud to sponsor the bill to &ldquo;ensure our farmers have a seat at the table when the government makes decisions impacting our national security.&rdquo; Tester added that he was not going to &ldquo;sit back&rdquo; and &ldquo;let our foreign adversaries weaken our national security by buying up American farmland.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture is the lifeblood of South Dakota&rsquo;s economy, worth nearly $12 billion in 2021, according to the South Dakota Department of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources (pdf). As the state&rsquo;s largest industry, agriculture leads tourism&mdash;the second-largest industry, estimated at over $4 billion in 2021&mdash;by three times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South Dakota Farmers Union (SDFU) and South Dakota Sheep Growers Association (SDSGA) have endorsed the bill. Doug Sombke, president of SDFU, in a statement also encouraged other state farmers&rsquo; unions to support the bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is cosponsored by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.). The House version, also introduced on Wednesday, is sponsored by Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Jim Costa (D-Calif.), and Rick Crawford (R-Ark.).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, CFIUS decided that it didn&rsquo;t have jurisdiction to review a land purchase related to a controversial Chinese corn mill project in Grand Forks, North Dakota. That project is located within 15 miles of the Grand Forks Air Force base, which houses sensitive drone, satellite, and surveillance technology, and has prompted significant pushback from Republican lawmakers and locals who say it threatens both national and economic security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Dec. 31, 2020, China owned 325,686 acres of U.S. agricultural land, according to the Department of Agriculture. While the acreage under Chinese ownership is slightly less than 1 percent of all foreign-held agricultural land, it represents a 20-fold leap from 13,720 acres in 2010.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the relatively low percentage of Chinese ownership does not diminish the severity of the threat, according to Rounds, who said that thwarting the trend is important.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lifenews.com/2023/02/01/satanic-temple-opens-new-abortion-clinic-to-kill-babies-in-ritualistic-abortions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.lifenews.com/2023/02/01/satanic-temple-opens-new-abortion-clinic-to-kill-babies-in-ritualistic-abortions/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satanic Temple Opens New Abortion Clinic to Kill Babies in Ritualistic Abortions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple isn&rsquo;t just promoting the killing of unborn babies in abortions anymore. It&rsquo;s actually killing them through a new &ldquo;religious&rdquo; abortion practice in New Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the satanic group launched a new &ldquo;religious medical services arm,&rdquo; TST Health, to begin doing abortions. The Satanic Temple believes aborting unborn babies is a religious &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; and compares it to communion or baptism for Christians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of its first &ldquo;telehealth&rdquo; abortion practice doubles as a covert death wish to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Samuel Alito&rsquo;s Mom&rsquo;s Satanic Abortion Clinic in New Mexico will offer abortion drugs to women ages 17 and up who are up to 11 weeks of pregnancy, according to Fox News. The FDA does not recommend abortion drugs after 10 weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In 1950, Samuel Alito&rsquo;s mother did not have options, and look what happened,&rdquo; said Malcolm Jarry, co-founder of The Satanic Temple, in a statement. &ldquo;Prior to 1973, doctors who performed abortions could lose their licenses and go to jail. The clinic&rsquo;s name serves to remind people just how important it is to have the right to control one&rsquo;s body and the potential ramifications of losing that right.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a press release from the group, &ldquo;anyone in New Mexico seeking to perform The Satanic Temple&rsquo;s abortion ritual will be able to receive free online medical services.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Licensed medical workers will screen patients during a virtual appointment, and then prescribe abortion drugs through pharmacies that will mail them in &ldquo;a discreet package,&rdquo; the group said. Women will be charged a pharmacy fee of about $90, it continued. The satanic group also set up a 24-hour abortion hotline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, The Satanic Temple leaders said they want to expand their new abortion practice to states that ban abortions. Their group has filed lawsuits in several states challenging their legal protections for unborn babies on religious grounds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The satanic group claims killing unborn babies in abortions is a religious ritual, and restricting it violates its &ldquo;fundamental tenets,&rdquo; according to an article on Glenn Beck&rsquo;s website. Its leaders also claim pro-life laws are rooted in &ldquo;Christian nationalism&rdquo; &ndash; even though people of all faiths and no faith believe basic human rights should apply to all human beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supposed religion claims to have &ldquo;seven fundamental tenets,&rdquo; including one that teaches, &ldquo;One&rsquo;s body is inviolable, subject to one&rsquo;s own will alone.&rdquo; In its lawsuits, the group claims abortion restrictions and bans violate this teaching as well as an &ldquo;abortion ritual&rdquo; that its members perform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It likens the &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; slaughter of unborn babies to communion or baptism for Christians. In 2020, it even raffled off an abortion to raise money for its lawsuits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple claims to have 700,000 members internationally, and it is a recognized religion by the IRS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group is deeply involved in abortion advocacy. Breitbart once described its work as a &ldquo;pro-abortion crusade to come to the aid of America&rsquo;s largest abortion provider,&rdquo; Planned Parenthood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the past decade, it has filed numerous lawsuits in different states to overturn pro-life laws, though its attempts thus far have failed. Other recent lawsuits include a challenge to the Texas heartbeat law, which pro-life advocates say has saved tens of thousands of unborn babies&rsquo; lives thus far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Satanic Temple also is pushing its beliefs on young children. Recently, the group began opening clubs in elementary schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, these satanic influences can be seen at pro-abortion rallies where abortion activists chant &ldquo;Hail, Satan!&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;fight like hell&rdquo; has become common among prominent pro-abortion politicians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, earlier this month, New York City leaders erected a golden statue to abortion on top of a city courthouse. Many described the statue, a naked woman with horns, as demonic or satanic.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspects in assassination of Haitian president taken into US custody</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, US officials announced that four suspects in custody for the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Mo&iuml;se on July 7, 2021 were transferred to the United States for their prosecution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CBS News, "The defendants, James Solages, 37, Joseph Vincent, 57, Alejandro Riveria Garcia, 44, and Christian Sanon, 54, are currently being held in US custody. Solages and Vincent, both US citizens from Florida, were arrested in Haiti shortly after the assassination."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 53-year-old Haitian president was shot 12 times and his wife wounded when his assassins entered his home located near Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspects James Solage and Joseph Vincent, the two US citizens, were arrested first after Mo&iuml;se's killing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Post, Christian Sanon, was " an elderly pastor, doctor, and failed businessman that authorities have identified as a key player. His associates have suggested he was duped by the real &mdash; and still unidentified &mdash; masterminds behind the assassination."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandro Garc&iacute;a, the fourth suspect being moved to the US and a Colombian citizen, was a member of the Colombian, as "nearly two dozen former Colombian soldiers charged in the case."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Mo&iuml;se's death, Haiti's gang activity and related violence increased to historic levels. Judges and local officials grew fearful as they received death threats concerning the assassination trial which contributed to the case being stalled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Justice said, Rivera, Solanges, and Vincent were charged with "conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping outside the US and providing material support and resources resulting in death."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanon was charged with "conspiring to smuggle goods from the US and providing unlawful export information," and allegedly moved 20 ballistic protective vests into Haiti.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven suspects in total are now in US federal custody awaiting trial for their part in the assassination. The four men recently moved to the US are set to appear in court in Miami on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Post Millennial reported, Solanges, unidentified at the time, said that the assassination attempt was a DEA operation in an effort to solicit compliance from Haitian security guarding the president.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/30/stephen-and-ayesha-curry-object-to-new-housing-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/01/30/stephen-and-ayesha-curry-object-to-new-housing-development/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen and Ayesha Curry oppose multi-family development near their $30M home</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Famed NBA marksman Stephen Curry appears more comfortable with 3-point daggers than 3-story developments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with his influencer wife Ayesha, Curry has objected to the establishment of multi-family housing on a property next to his sprawling California mansion, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, the couple told officials in Atherton &mdash; one of the nation&rsquo;s most exclusive enclaves &mdash; that the three-story town houses would encroach on their privacy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routinely vocal on matters of social justice, the Bay Area power couple indicated that joining the well-heeled chorus of objection made them uneasy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We hesitate to add to the &lsquo;not in our backyard&rsquo; (literally) rhetoric, but we wanted to send a note before today&rsquo;s meeting,&rdquo; they wrote on Jan. 18. &ldquo;Safety and privacy for us and our kids continues to be our top priority and one of the biggest reasons we chose to live in Atherton.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home to tech moguls, athletes and international business titans, Atherton officials will reluctantly submit a plan to the state this week outlining their efforts to increase housing density.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parcel in question &mdash; which is nea the Curry residence &mdash; is set to be rezoned in order to accommodate several multi-family units sought by the owner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;With the density being proposed for 23 Oakwood, there are major concerns in terms of both privacy and safety with three-story townhomes looming directly behind us,&rdquo; their email read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple noted that the development would not add to low-income housing to the area, only increase density.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If their municipal buzzer beater falls short, the Currys asked the town to erect &ldquo;considerably taller fencing and landscaping to block sight lines onto our family&rsquo;s property.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple recently sold their prior Atherton home for $31 million and bought their current 17,000 square foot spread for $30 million, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other local heavyweights &mdash; including billionaire investor Marc Andriessen &mdash; have previously lobbied against the introduction of more affordable housing into the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a median home price of more than $7 million, Atherton ranked first on Forbes&rsquo; priciest zip code list last year.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Few people today know about the remarkable career of Sabine Baring Gould. Anglican priest, father of fifteen, archaeologist, anthropologist, author of novels, short stories, hymns, biographies, and travelogues, amateur painter and ironworker, translator, preserver of folk music, the list goes on and on. Tony Esolen commented that he could only have lived in the nineteenth century. Using Baring Gould&rsquo;s life as a starting point, the guys discuss Tony&rsquo;s comment, examining why the nineteenth century produced such a wide-ranging genius, where we might find them today, and what we can do to begin recovering similar capacities today.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exhortation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dressing for the King</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">God meets us where we are, not where we should have been. This means that when someone walks into church off the street smelling and looking like the world, they are most welcome. Jesus welcomed us in our sins, and therefore, sinners of every stripe are most welcome. Come and welcome to Jesus Christ. But part of the glory of this grace is that it doesn&rsquo;t leave us there. God&rsquo;s grace changes us; it restores us and glorifies us to the kind of human beings we were created to be.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is part of why historically, the church has sought to dress for the occasion. We dress up for church because we are meeting with our King, and we dress up because we believe that this is part of what the King is doing in us and for us. He is taking our old sinful rags and giving us His royal robes of righteousness. He has done this definitively in Jesus Christ, but He is doing this progressively as we are changed from glory to glory, as we grow into Jesus Christ. We have no interest in turning this into any kind of fashion show: whether the hypocrisy of Pharisees in their long robes or the hypocrisy of showboating, with fancy suits or gaudy jewelry. What we are aiming for is simplicity and thoughtfulness. Giving thought to simple, modest dressing up for church can be one easy way to show honor for God and the occasion of worship and show kindness to one another.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The focal point of worship is Jesus, not you, and not your comfort. Of course in our world tastes, preferences, and styles vary, and we really don&rsquo;t want to be cranky or legalistic at all. But flipflops and sweatpants generally communicate that something is casual and not very important, while tuxedos and low cut blouses or short skirts communicate &ldquo;hey everybody, look at me.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s striking that in Timothy, Paul says that men need to make sure that they are worshiping free of all wrath and doubting and women need to make sure they are worshiping modestly, without showing off their bodies or jewelry or hair. As Hebrews says, let us worship acceptably with reverence and fear; for our God is a consuming fire.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/u-s-surgeon-general-warns-13-years-old-is-too-young-to-join-social-media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/u-s-surgeon-general-warns-13-years-old-is-too-young-to-join-social-media</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Surgeon General Warns 13-Years-Old Is Too Young To Join Social Media</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy believes children 13 years old are too young to join social media platforms, citing kids are still &ldquo;developing their identity,&rdquo; and such engagement can create a distorted sense of themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murthy, who has served as surgeon general under the Obama and the Biden administrations, signaled the warning in an interview with CNN, noting adolescents should only be allowed to access the platforms until they were 16 years old at the earliest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time, you know, early adolescence, where kids are developing their identity, their sense of self,&rdquo; Murthy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time where it&rsquo;s really important for us to be thoughtful about what&rsquo;s going into how they think about their own self-worth and their relationships, and the skewed and often distorted environment of social media often does a disservice to many of those children.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media giant platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter require a minimum age of 13 to join.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murthy further noted the issue with addictive algorithms, which pits youth against Big Tech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You have some of the best designers and product developers in the world who have designed these products to make sure people are maximizing the amount of time they spend on these platforms,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if we tell a child, use the force of your willpower to control how much time you&rsquo;re spending, you&rsquo;re pitting a child against the world&rsquo;s greatest product designers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just not a fair fight,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And so that&rsquo;s why I think our kids need help.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journal of the American Medical Association published a study earlier this month which sampled 178 12-year-olds from three public middle schools in North Carolina and reviewed how often the minors check social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found individuals with habitual checking behaviors showed initial hypoactivation but increasing sensitivity to potential social cues over time. Nonhabitual individuals, however, showed initial hyperactivation and decreasing sensitivity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Adriana Stacey told CNN using social media releases a &ldquo;dopamine dump&rdquo; and compared the addictiveness of smartphones to cocaine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surgeon General Murthy called on parents to band together to prevent their children from logging on to social media platforms until they&rsquo;re at least 16 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Public School District officials filed a lawsuit earlier this month against several social media platform owners, including Facebook and TikTok, for allegedly intentionally cultivating and creating a mental health crisis among the youth and have caused a public nuisance affecting Seattle Public Schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden drew attention to social media platforms in his 2022 State of the Union Address, alleging the harm social media has wrought on American youth should implore all to &ldquo;hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they&rsquo;re conducting on our children for profit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration &amp; General Murthy took fire howewver, due to what appears to be inconscistencies in their rules.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told "CNN Newsroom" host Pamela Brown that parents should look to push back the age at which their children begin using social media platforms to make sure kids "don't get exposed to harm early."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last March, Murthy addressed a directive from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, R., effectively cutting gender-affirming care for minors in his state, taking to Twitter to write, "Yesterday afternoon in Austin, I met with transgender youth and their parents to hear how they are coping in light of the state's recent directive equating gender-affirming care to child abuse."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The pain and fear in their voices was heartbreaking. Parents and kids are terrified about being separated. They described repeated attacks on their families at traumatic&hellip; LGBTQ+ youth were already at increased risk of suicide and other mental health struggles. We should be seeking to provide them with support and medical care&hellip;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Forcing parents to choose between following medical advice for their child and risking an investigation from the state is simply not right. The government shouldn't be interfering with decisions between doctors and patients," he continued.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol Agents Told to Not Chase All Vehicles That Flee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas&mdash;Border Patrol agents will soon be limited in chasing vehicles that flee from them, under new rules unveiled in January and set to take effect in May.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents must determine that vehicular pursuits are &ldquo;necessary and objectively reasonable&rdquo; under the rules, and can terminate a pursuit at any time without fear of questioning from superiors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents are being told that they must consider factors such as &ldquo;the seriousness of the reason&rdquo; for a pursuit and weather conditions when deciding whether to chase a fleeing vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint or port of entry&mdash;the official places to enter the United States from Mexico and Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A Vehicular Pursuit is considered Necessary when an Authorized Officer/Agent concludes there is an immediate need to apprehend a subject as part of their enforcement duties based on the totality of the known facts and circumstances,&rdquo; the rules state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pursuit meets the &ldquo;objectively reasonable&rdquo; standard when the government&rsquo;s interest in apprehending the persons or people in the fleeing vehicle &ldquo;clearly outweighs the Foreseeability of Risk to the public, officers/agents, other law enforcement, and vehicle occupants,&rdquo; the rules state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents must evaluate the interest and the potential risk when choosing whether to pursue a fleeing vehicle and continue the evaluation during the chase. They must also alert a supervisor &ldquo;as soon as feasible&rdquo; during a pursuit and immediately terminate the chase if the supervisor does not authorize it to continue, or orders it stopped.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a chase is terminated, agents must pull their vehicle over to signal to the public and the fleeing driver that the chase has ended, according to the rules. They must alert superiors. They can then start driving again in the last known direction of the fleeing vehicle to check for &ldquo;crashes, potential flight on foot, to determine if the Subject Vehicle was abandoned, or for any other incident.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules also suggest alternatives to vehicular pursuits, such as tracking with airplanes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troy Miller, who became acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner in late 2022 after the ouster of Chris Magnus, said that vehicular pursuits &ldquo;pose inherent risks&mdash;to members of the public, officers and agents, and vehicle occupants&rdquo; and that the new policy &ldquo;acknowledges these risks and shifts our Agency&rsquo;s overall approach to a risk-based model when it comes to pursuits.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnus stressed that the policy does not bar vehicular pursuits but &ldquo;provides a clear framework&rdquo; for weighing the risks associated with pursuits against the benefits.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://hotair.com/tree-hugging-sister/2023/01/30/florida-taking-the-first-steps-to-become-26th-constitutional-carry-state-n527375"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/tree-hugging-sister/2023/01/30/florida-taking-the-first-steps-to-become-26th-constitutional-carry-state-n527375</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida taking the first steps to become 26th constitutional carry state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speaker of the Florida House announced lawmakers had filed the bill this morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida lawmakers&rsquo; promise to introduce legislation allowing permitless concealed carry of firearms, called &ldquo;Constitutional Carry&rdquo; by proponents, has been met. At a Monday morning press briefing, House Speaker Paul Renner (R-Palm Coast) and other gathered lawmakers announced House Bill 543, which would allow weapons and firearms without a license for concealment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed bill was written by Rep. Chuck Brannan (R-Lake City), with state Sen. Jay Collins (R-Tampa) writing the companion legislation for the Florida Senate. Gov. Ron DeSantis said in December that he was committed to the legislation passing and urged state lawmakers to propose it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed bill, Floridians would no longer need to apply for a license for concealed carry. The state of Florida already allows firearm purchases for those 21 and older without need of state application, aside from federal requirements for background checks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the bill pass, the regulation of concealed carry permits, handled by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, would end.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York hotel mobbed by illegal migrants who refuse to leave</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal aliens standing outside of the Watson Hotel in New York's Hell's Kitchen district on Sunday night refused to leave for a new shelter, causing police to mobilize.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 50 migrants were outside of the hotel, along with activists who were handing out food and water.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials said that single men were supposed to be brought to a new shelter at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal that would provide the same services that they were receiving at the hotel. The city bus arrived, but only a small number of migrants hopped on the bus. Most decided to stay outside the hotel on West 57th Street. Activists claimed that migrants were being relocated from the hotel. One activist was quoted telling the New York Post that they were prepared to stay overnight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dozen police were originally stationed at the Watson hotel, with police remaining on-scene until around midnight as migrants were still surrounding the entrance of the hotel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brooklyn Cruise Terminal is a new mega shelter that can house as many as 1,000 single adult men, Mayor Eric Adams said last week.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/suicide-bomber-breaches-high-security-in-pakistan-mosque-kills-59"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/crime-pmn/suicide-bomber-breaches-high-security-in-pakistan-mosque-kills-59</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now in world news&hellip; Suicide bomber breaches high security in Pakistan mosque, kills 59</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A suicide bomber blew himself up inside a crowded mosque in a highly fortified security compound in Pakistan on Monday, killing 59 people, the latest attack by resurgent Islamist militants targeting police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attacker appeared to have passed through several barricades manned by security forces to get into the &ldquo;Red Zone&rdquo; compound that houses police and counter-terrorism offices in the volatile northwestern city of Peshawar, police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the 170 wounded people were in critical condition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death toll rose to 59 after several people succumbed to their wounds, hospital official Mohammad Asim said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bombing happened a day before an International Monetary Fund mission to Islamabad to initiate talks on unlocking funding for the South Asian country&rsquo;s economy, which is enduring a balance of payments crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bomber detonated his load at the moment hundreds of people lined up to say their prayers, officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have found traces of explosives,&rdquo; Khan told reporters, adding that a security lapse had clearly occurred as the bomber had slipped through the most secured area of the compound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An inquiry was under way into how the attacker breached such an elite security cordon and whether there was any inside help.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We continue our series in the Ten Commandments with the command against idolatry. In this episode, Joe Boot discusses the root of idolatry in the heart, and deals with some listener questions about the possibility of making work or family into an object of worship. We conclude by examining idolatry within the church itself.</p>

   <title><![CDATA[Having Two Legs: School Choice [Pastor Toby’s Blog]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/65a595b2-e943-413b-a00a-eddf48965d53/having-two-legs-school-choice.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Choice</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever something sounds too good to be true, the rule of any sane person should be to consider it a scam until proven otherwise. When you get that email from that Saudi Arabian Prince wanting to share his inheritance with you, I&rsquo;m no financial advisor or Middle Eastern political dilettante, but I advise you to use your trash button vigorously.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when a movement begins picking up steam calling for &ldquo;school choice,&rdquo; thoughtful Christians and conservatives should have all their hackles done up for a party and their rhetorical guns at the ready. Remember, we live in a land that celebrates &ldquo;choice,&rdquo; and that means murdering babies. We live in a land that celebrates &ldquo;choice,&rdquo; and grooms little kids into sexual confusion and madness, secretly castrates teenagers without parental knowledge or consent, and demands you take injections of unspecified content because&hellip; shut up, you bigot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s the world we live in. So when people begin heralding a new found freedom of choice, freedom to choose whatever school you want your children to attend, dollars following kids, and so on, it would be good, healthy even, to get all of your defenses up, and maybe even pull out a few knives. This is the exact same scene of many crimes in our land. Your cursor should be hovering over that trash button.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I think we should exploit every opportunity to dismantle the government education monopoly. I think we should ride every bit of this wave to press for real educational freedom and parental sovereignty and responsibility, but conservative Christians have a bad habit of being manipulated through soundbites and ending up in worse positions than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let&rsquo;s review. Currently, as far as I know, the way government education works in the United States is that everyone who owns property pays into a state fund, that state fund is augmented by various federal programs and subsidies, which are taken of course from federal income taxes, and then those moneys are redistributed to counties and school districts based on various state guidelines, including number of children enrolled in school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that parents who do not want to send their children to public schools, must pay into the government education programs via property taxes even though you don&rsquo;t use the program, and don&rsquo;t forget that if you pay rent, you are still paying into the program via your monthly rent. Your landlord is making sure that your rent covers all his property taxes. This is educational welfare, redistribution, and unjust taxation. Millions of Americans have defied this educational socialism and Marxism by bearing the costs of home schooling and private schooling on top of the taxes they are already paying for government schools they don&rsquo;t use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I tweeted recently: &ldquo;One of the greatest modern rebellions has been the homeschool/private school movement: millions of Americans making the sacrifice to pay tuition/costs on top of their taxes, effectively paying tuition twice. The next step is getting our tax money back with no strings attached.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us to the so-called &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; movement. I would love to be wrong about this. I would love to find out that some state really is letting parents completely opt out of government regulation, government coercion, and government redistribution for education. But as far as I know, the &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; programs being pushed are actually an expansion of government regulation and redistribution and no lessening of the foundational coercion involved in the unjust taxation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common program being championed by &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; advocates right now are ESA&rsquo;s &ndash; Education Savings Accounts. In these programs, the state agrees to deposit money in a savings account for qualified parents to use on qualified educational programs. The key words in that last sentence are &ldquo;state&rdquo; and &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; and &ldquo;qualified.&rdquo; This tells you most of what you need to know. In these schemes, the &ldquo;state&rdquo; is still claiming sovereignty over the educational venture, and this is proven by the fact that the state is determining which families are &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; to have some of their money back and which educational programs are &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; to receive those monies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I&rsquo;m happy to grant that there may be some short term wins for parents in these programs. A poor, single mom that wants to send her kids to a Classical Christian school suddenly has the tuition dollars and doesn&rsquo;t feel trapped in the public school where her kids are being brainwashed all day long. I totally get it. But we are Christians, and we have to think further ahead than the next five minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, while I have all kinds of compassion for that single mom, I want to insist that a community that has not already given her all kinds of resources to pull her kids out of government schools and enroll them in a Christian option of her choice is a community that is not ready for a gush of greenbacks from the government teat. The community that has not already declared war on the communism inherent in government schools and made the great sacrifices to evacuate their children from those occupied territories is not a community that has proven to have the wisdom, discernment, or compassion necessary to see through this minefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, consider the fallout of expanded government redistribution and regulation. We&rsquo;ve already seen this in higher education. What happened over the last forty years with Pell grants and government loans? Our higher education system has gone to Hell. And I mean that literally. Even most of the so-called Christian colleges and universities are loaded up with Diversity Inclusion and Equity clowns. The current is so strong that even Grove City College, one of the only colleges in the nation that doesn&rsquo;t take government money, is in the thick of controversy over diversity and woke policies. I know of a young woman personally who was forced to leave during COVID because she refused to comply with their anti-science masking regime.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will the result be of government funding through ESAs? Mass compromise. Why? Because money ill-gotten corrupts. That money being put in your ESA? That&rsquo;s blood money. Property taxes are an evil and immoral stain on our land since they imply that if you don&rsquo;t pay taxes on the land and home that you &ldquo;own,&rdquo; they may be seized to pay for your back taxes, which essentially means that you are in a long term lease agreement with the government for your so-called property. So much for private property.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of these wicked laws is wide ranging, but landing on the elderly and others with fixed incomes the hardest. As communities grow and develop, home and property values tend to rise, and with values rising, taxes rise. An elderly widow whose husband faithfully provided for her will often find it difficult to continue paying rising property taxes and be forced to sell her family estate. This is nothing short of Ahab&rsquo;s theft of Naboth&rsquo;s Vineyard in slow motion. If Ahab offers to let you use some of Naboth&rsquo;s vineyard for a garden, is it moral to take him up on that offer?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I am not arguing that all taxation is theft. I&rsquo;m simply arguing that taxation of property, with the implicit threat of seizing assets if you don&rsquo;t pay, is highway robbery in a bureaucratic business suit, even if the measure passed by 99% of the vote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s never OK to demand someone pay you something they don&rsquo;t want or use with the threat of stealing their stuff if they don&rsquo;t pay you.Everything the government funds ends up costing more and driving quality down. If you don&rsquo;t think that will happen with ESAs there&rsquo;s a Saudi Arabian prince I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When money is more easily gotten, the pressure to raise prices increases. But when the money easily gotten is not based on real goods and services (real values), those price increases are simply inflation. And when you start down a path of incrementally accepting more money without a corresponding demand for increasing quality or quantity, you are already accepting a downgrade of quality. Again, I refer you to the American college scene, where billions of dollars are not only being spent to brainwash future teachers, doctors, and lawyers into believing Darwinian and Marxist lies, but they are also doing so with waterslides, climbing walls, jacuzzis, and dormitory amenities that keep STD rates high and virginity rates low.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve heard some proposing &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; in the form of tax credits. The plus side of tax credits would be relative lack of strings attached. The downside would still be the government pretending to have the authority to take our money in the first place. This would also likely continue to include some measure of redistribution since tax credits are often awarded based on income levels, granting larger credits to those with lower incomes. If tax credits were matched to actual taxation payments that would be even closer to giving people back the money stolen from them, but then why do we continue to allow our money to be taken in the first place? On what planet is it OK for the government to require you to pay for services that you object to, that you refuse, that you aren&rsquo;t using? If Christians have gotten their heads around the need to defund Planned Parenthood because we object to our tax dollars funding the murder of little babies, why can&rsquo;t we get our heads around the right of parents to decide how to spend their own money on the education of their own children? Why can&rsquo;t we simply demand the right to opt out?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cry and hue goes up that unless the state provides education, the poor will suffer, and the social and economic impact will be disastrous. But this really is ridiculous, government programs have the worst track records. They are bloated with regulations, red tape, and nuisance bureaucracy. The government insisting that if they don&rsquo;t take care of education, the poor will suffer, is like an obese man insisting that if he doesn&rsquo;t run the exercise and nutrition programs everyone will be sick and unhealthy. Just look at San Fransisco, Seattle, Portland. Look at those Marxist utopian paradises. Our answer needs to simply be that we will take care of our own poor, thank you very much. You have done quite enough, Mr. Fat Ass Government. Get your greasy paws off our schools.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suspect that there are backroom deals being made with these &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; programs. I suspect that Big Tech and Big Business are somewhere in those backrooms pulling strings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education is a massive business (like health care), and if you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s corruption involved have I told you that I&rsquo;m a Saudi Arabian prince with a gold mine I need to unload? While there is some resistance on the Left that might make &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; seem like a real suckerpunch to their beloved Democrat training centers, er, I mean schools, Christians must understand that they do not have any real &ldquo;school choice,&rdquo; until they have full and complete choice over how to spend their own money for their own children.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we&rsquo;re going to make some kind of deal, the deal has to include the right of parents to opt out of the government education system. Since the god of Big Tech and Big Government is Mammon, I would suggest trying to broker a deal between some corporate fat cats and government fat cats. Could we convince the true believers in government education to let us leave this Egypt if they could give all their teachers a raise and every student a laptop and lifetime supply of condoms because Google is buying a few seats on the State Education board? Short of a radical gospel Reformation in our land, we need to be thinking and praying strategically. Can we off them a deal they can&rsquo;t refuse so that we can get out? But convincing them to let us use some of the money they stole isn&rsquo;t really a jailbreak; it&rsquo;s more like building an addition on the jail and letting you invite your school to use the new &ldquo;wing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
