<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden spars over classified documents in garage with Fox News' Peter Doocy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden sparred with Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy on Thursday, following revelations that a second batch of classified documents had been discovered at one of Biden's homes in Delaware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House Counsel's Office announced the discovery on Thursday, saying it had initiated a search of Biden's homes in Rehoboth Beach and Wilmington after news of the first stash broke this week and found documents in the Wilmington home's garage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Il8R4BEhrjo"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Fox News presses Biden over classified docs in garage: 'What were you thinking?'&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Il8R4BEhrjo&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Fox News presses Biden over classified docs in garage: 'What were you thinking?'</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play Video</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House lawyers say they immediately contacted the DOJ when they discovered the documents this week. There has been no indication of what the documents contain or whether Biden or anyone else read them after he left office as vice president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wilmington documents are the second stash of Obama-era classified documents to be uncovered. The first collection was found at the Washington office of the Penn Biden Center, a Biden-aligned think tank.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/more-americans-id-as-republicans-than-democrats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/more-americans-id-as-republicans-than-democrats</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Americans identify as Republicans than Democrats</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in decades, more people identify as Republicans than Democrats, a striking change that bolsters polls showing that the United States is a moderate-conservative nation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest massive Gallup survey of 10,000 adults, 45% identified as Republicans and 44% as Democrats. That&rsquo;s a tiny edge for sure, but it&rsquo;s the first time the GOP has had the lead since former President George H.W. Bush launched the Gulf War in 1991.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup said: &ldquo;A virtual tie in party identification and leaning represents one of the better outcomes for the Republican Party over the past three decades.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when the choice of independents is thrown in, more U.S. adults picked that label. &ldquo;Since 2009, independent identification has grown and reached levels not seen before. Now, political independents (41%) greatly outnumber Republican (28%) and Democratic (28%) identifiers,&rdquo; said Gallup on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a related survey, the polling giant also said that America politically is a moderate-conservative nation. When asked to describe their political views, 47% of adults said moderate, 30% conservative, and 21% liberal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That survey also revealed that the Democrats are more liberal than ever. &ldquo;After hovering near 50% in recent years, the percentage of Democrats who identify as politically liberal rose four percentage points in 2022 to 54%, a new high for this group,&rdquo; said Gallup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.based-politics.com/2023/01/11/these-5-states-lost-the-most-population-in-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.based-politics.com/2023/01/11/these-5-states-lost-the-most-population-in-2022/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These 5 states lost the most population in 2022</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another year is in the books, which means there&rsquo;s another year of data to analyze, too. And the Tax Foundation just published an interesting analysis shedding light on which states gained the most population in 2022&mdash;and which ones saw residents leave in droves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis examined the time period between July 2021 and July 2022 and found overall US population growth was at 0.4%, but some states&rsquo; populations shrank while others grew. As it turns out, the state that gained the most population was Florida, which saw 1.9% population growth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states that gained 1% population include Idaho, South Carolina, Texas, South Dakota, Montana, Delaware, Arizona, North Carolina, Utah, Tennessee, Georgia, and Nevada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the 5 states that lost the most population were:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York (-0.9%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois (-0.8%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana (-0.8%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Virginia (-0.6%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii (-0.5%)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noticing any trends yet?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, the states losing population are blue states with high taxes and heavily restricted economies. On the other hand, the booming states, like Florida, South Carolina, and Texas, are red states with lower tax burdens and less-regulated economies. That&rsquo;s just speculation, but it&rsquo;s borne out in the data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;People move for many reasons,&rdquo; the Tax Foundation explains. &ldquo;Sometimes taxes are expressly part of the calculation. Often, they play an indirect role (by contributing to a broadly favorable economic environment). And other times, of course, they don&rsquo;t factor in at all. The Census data and these industry studies cannot tell us exactly why each person moved, but there is no denying a very strong correlation between low-tax, low-cost states and population growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It really is becoming so glaring that even New York Governor Kathy Hochul recently admitted their state needs to address its population drain&mdash;months after telling Republicans to &ldquo;get out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As twitter user Jim Stinson tweeted: If you tell people to leave, they will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you over-regulate them and overtax them, they will leave faster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/out-of-left-field-uscs-school-of-social-work-bans-the-word-field-because-its-racist-apparently"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/out-of-left-field-uscs-school-of-social-work-bans-the-word-field-because-its-racist-apparently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USC&rsquo;s School Of Social Work Bans The Word &lsquo;Field&rsquo; Because It&rsquo;s Racist, Apparently</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever aspired to be the best in your field? Did you ever refer to doing a job outside of the office as &ldquo;field work?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if you answered yes to any of those questions, then you may unwittingly be promoting racism and bigotry &mdash; according to the University of Southern California School of Social Work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems wokeness knows no bounds &mdash; which is entirely the point of those who promote it. They have no limit in their zeal to assert power and are willing to coerce you into following along with their plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 9, the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work sent an email to faculty, staff, and students notifying them that the department has new speech code guidelines in order to ensure &ldquo;inclusive language and practice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Specifically, we have decided to remove the term &lsquo;field,&rsquo; from our curriculum and practice and replace it with &lsquo;practicum,'&rdquo; the letter explained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is so egregious about the word &ldquo;field&rdquo;? Well, according to the brainiacs out on the West Coast, it is offensive to black and immigrants everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Language can be powerful, and phrases such as &lsquo;going into the field&rsquo; or &lsquo;fieldwork&rsquo; may have connotations for descendants of slavery and immigrant workers that are not benign,&rdquo; according to the letter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a word isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;benign&rdquo; that would mean it is malignant. Per the letter sent around, the word &ldquo;field&rdquo; is so malevolent that merely using it promotes &ldquo;white supremacy, anti-immigrant and anti-blackness ideologies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the school is beginning to put its words into action by banning the term altogether.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In doing so, of course, they are unwittingly revealing their own racism by implying that only black people and immigrants work in &ldquo;fields.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t need to be said, but of course, every civilization on earth has had &ldquo;fields&rdquo; in one form or another and somebody who worked there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://humanevents.com/2023/01/11/italian-mp-giorgia-meloni-mimics-desantis-sends-migrants-to-left-run-cities?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://humanevents.com/2023/01/11/italian-mp-giorgia-meloni-mimics-desantis-sends-migrants-to-left-run-cities?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italian PM Giorgia Meloni Pulls a DeSantis, Sends Migrants to Left-Run Cities</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is facing a fierce backlash from their left-wing detractors after directing NGO ships carrying illegal migrants to ports in cities governed by pro-migration mayors, a move immediately compared to a policy ordered by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a recent security decree, authorities are now redirecting vessels that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to ports located farther away from the search and rescue area, frequently opting for cities governed by leftist mayors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the decree has been met with opposition from the left-leaning Democratic Party and the mayors of the affected cities, both of whom argue the measures are excessive and go against the supposed advantages of mass illegal migration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these concerns were rubbished by Wand Ferro, the undersecretary at Italy&rsquo;s Interior Ministry, who said: &ldquo;The left protests because NGO ships are finally disembarking in other regions of central Italy and no longer only in the South. Evidently, on the left, they would like to transform Calabria and Sicily into the refugee camp of Europe, a completely unacceptable prospect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferro stated that the asylum centers in southern Italy have faced persistent strain for years and that the government's action to alleviate that pressure amount to a necessary response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also dismissed the criticisms from NGOs who operate the migrant transport ships, pointing out that it is not unusual for these ships to keep refugees at sea for extended periods while waiting to pick up more migrants, adding that these ships have a tendency to take migrants to European ports instead of closer ports located in North Africa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Perhaps the left suffers from a sort of NIMBY [not in my backyard] syndrome, preaching welcome as long as it is away from their backyard,&rdquo; Ferro continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, NGOs who help facilitate these routes of illegal migration complained in a joint statement that the policy is hindering their efforts to save stranded migrants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Among other rules, the Italian government requires civilian rescue ships to head to Italy after each rescue immediately," the statement reads. "This delays further lifesaving operations, as ships usually carry out multiple rescues over the course of several days."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy of the Meloni conservative government, which came to power in last October's general election, immediately drew comparisons to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who last year sent illegal migrants to the wealthy, heavily liberal island enclave of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move sparked outrage from wealthy residents, with local authorities opting to activate the National Guard in order to have the individuals quickly removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Thursday, January 12th, 2022. We&rsquo;ve got a lot of news to get to folks, so let&rsquo;s get right to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-vote-against-bill-requiring-medical-care-babies-born-alive-abortion-attempt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-vote-against-bill-requiring-medical-care-babies-born-alive-abortion-attempt</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">210 Democrats vote against bill requiring medical care for babies born alive after abortion attempt</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly every House Democrat on Wednesday voted against legislation that would require immediate medical attention for babies who are born alive after an attempt was made to abort them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which says any infant born alive after an attempted abortion is a "legal person for all purposes under the laws of the United States." Doctors would be required to care for those infants as a "reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill passed 220-210, and all 210 of the "no" votes came from Democrats. Only one Democrat voted for the bill &mdash; Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas &mdash; and one other Democrat, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, voted "present."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that level of care, doctors would be required admit those infants to a hospital for further care. Any violation of this standard would result in fines and imprisonment for up to five years, or both.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans argued on the floor that comments from Virginia&rsquo;s former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam are an example of why the law needs to be clarified to protect newborn infants who survive abortions. Northam was talking about third-trimester abortions and appeared to indicate support for delivering babies that might still be alive before taking their life outside the womb.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We all know in 2019, then-Gov. Northam of the state of Virginia stated this: 'The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that&rsquo;s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,'" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The cavalier attitude he displayed towards human life is just wrong," Jordan said. "It is simple. Infants born alive following an abortion are kids, are children. All newborns deserve the same level of care."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Democrats overwhelmingly rejected the bill. Some, like Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., argued that the bill would set up new requirements that would "directly interfere with the doctors&rsquo; medical judgment and dictate a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all circumstances."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and other Democrats said the requirement to eventually take infants who survive abortion to a hospital may not be in the best interest of the family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats said the bill is unnecessary because it is already illegal to kill newborn infants, but Republicans accused Democrats of opposing the legislation to further their radical agenda of abortion on demand.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAA grounds all outbound domestic flights as system crashes; Update: FAA lifts ground stop</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this writing, the FAA has grounded all outbound domestic flights until at least 9 am ET. It may take longer than that to restore service to its NOTAM system, the on-line platform that all commercial and military pilots must consult before taking off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disruption began hours earlier, and the FAA has apparently struggled to overcome it. Savannah Guthrie calls it a &ldquo;sweeping outage,&rdquo; and it will almost certainly impact flights for hours even after the FAA restores it:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1613145694923096065"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1613145694923096065</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FAA lifted the national ground stop a few minutes ago, but it&rsquo;s not clear whether the NOTAM system has been fully restored or they&rsquo;re using work-arounds. They reopened two airports without out NOTAM due to &ldquo;air congestion&rdquo; prior to ending the ground stop:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well over 500 flights got cancelled this morning and over three thousand delayed. The snarl in air travel today will be massive. Stay tuned.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican President Praises Biden for Not Building Border Wall Even When &lsquo;Conservatives Don&rsquo;t Like It&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has praised President Joe Biden for taking a stand against the U.S. border wall, and criticized conservatives during the North American Leaders&rsquo; Summit on Tuesday. It comes as the United States sees a surge in illegal immigration across the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You, President Biden, you are the first president of the United States in a very long time that has not built not even one meter of wall. And that&mdash;we thank you for that, sir, although some might not like it&mdash;although the conservatives don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Lopez Obrador said in a joint press conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thanked Biden for maintaining a &ldquo;relationship of cooperation&rdquo; with Mexico and for not subjecting Mexicans who &ldquo;live and work in a very honest fashion&rdquo; in the United States to harassment. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not suffering raids as it unfortunately used to happen in the past,&rdquo; the Mexican president added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez Obrador asked Biden to insist that Congress &ldquo;regularize the migration situations&rdquo; of millions of Mexicans who have been living in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 21, 2021, a day after becoming president, Biden issued an executive order that halted construction of the border wall, commenting that a massive wall spanning the entire southern border is &ldquo;not a serious policy solution&rdquo; and a &ldquo;waste of money.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2017 and 2020, 450 miles of the wall were authorized and built under the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July last year, the Department of Homeland Security announced that the remaining funds, which were allocated for the construction of the wall along the Mexico&ndash;U.S. border, would be spent on &ldquo;environmental remediation and mitigation&rdquo; as well as for installing cameras, lighting, and detection technology in places where barriers are already built.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Biden administration, illegal immigrants entering via the southern border have surged. During fiscal year 2020, there were 458,088 apprehensions. This rose to 1.73 million in fiscal year 2021, a jump of 278 percent, data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During fiscal year 2022, apprehensions rose to 2.3 million. In the first two months of fiscal year 2023, apprehensions exceeded the total apprehensions of fiscal year 2020. According to Steven Kopits with Princeton Policy Advisors, the rise in border crossers is set to continue its upward trend this year as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kopits had earlier predicted around 2 million apprehensions for 2021 and 2.3 million for 2022, which is close to the actual numbers. For 2023, Kopits is predicting apprehensions to hit 2.6 million, another record in terms of annual illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Kopits&rsquo;s projections are true, it would mean that 6.9 million illegal aliens would have been apprehended between 2021 and 2023 under the Biden administration.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-life pregnancy center hires private investigators to look into attack, blasts FBI: 'Where's the manhunt?'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A network of pro-life pregnancy centers in New York hired private investigators to probe a firebomb attack against a facility last June after what they describe as an inadequate response from federal law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They've been responsive, but what they've done we don't know," Tom Brejcha, president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Society, told Fox News Digital of the FBI.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CompassCare, which has multiple pro-life pregnancy centers in upstate New York, announced last week that it was joining forces with the society, a nonprofit law firm, to hire private investigators to find those behind the incident at their Buffalo office last summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Along with CompassCare and others, we're looking to investigate connections here," the lawyer explained. "We have security video of attackers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biological males blocked from competing in women's school sports in West Virginia: federal court</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge in West Virginia has upheld a state law preventing male athletes who identify as female from participating in female school sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a ruling on January 5, Judge Joseph R. Goodwin of the Southern District of West Virginia said that HB 3293, the Save Women&rsquo;s Sports Bill, was "constitutionally permissible." The bill defines "girl" and "women" as biologically female for the purpose of secondary school sports and Goodwin found that this was "substantially related to its important interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law was first introduced in March 2021 but was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The ACLU represented trans-identified male middle school student Becky Pepper-Jackson who was barred from the girls' cross-country team. This, the ACLU argued, was a violation of Pepper-Jackson&rsquo;s rights under the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, the federal state statute that prohibits sex-based discrimination, reports Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Goodwin ruled in favor of the ACLU and blocked the law at the preliminary stage, ruling that Pepper-Jackson was being excluded from school sports on the basis of sex making it a Title IX violation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Goodwin acknowledged in his new decision that the law was seeking to "prevent transgender girls from playing on girls&rsquo; sports teams," he highlighted the biological differences between males and females that give males a significant sporting advantage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While some females may be able to outperform some males, it is generally accepted that, on average, males outperform females athletically because of inherent physical differences between the sexes. This is not an overbroad generalization, but rather a general principle that realistically reflects the average physical differences between the sexes," said the judge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwin also noted that while Pepper-Jackson had taken puberty blockers, not all transgender athletes do. Some only socially transition, while others take blockers and hormones at a later stage in puberty. Goodwin stated that "there is much debate over whether and to what extent hormone therapies after puberty can reduce a transgender girl's athletic advantage over cisgender girls."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The fact is, however, that a transgender girl is biologically male and, barring medical intervention, would undergo male puberty like other biological males. And biological males generally outperform females athletically. The state is permitted to legislate sports rules on this basis because sex, and the physical characteristics that flow from it, are substantially related to athletic performance and fairness in sports," Goodwin ruled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West Virginia ACLU had filed the lawsuit alleging that banning girls from participating in school sports because they are transgender is unconstitutional.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2019 speech, developmental biologist Dr. Emma Hilton demonstrated just how wide the gap between the athletic performance of biological males and females is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"So big is the gap, there are 9000 males between 100m world record holders Usain Bolt and FloJo. So early does the gap emerge, the current female 100m Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson, is slower than the 14-year-old schoolboy record holder," said Hilton.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEYTON HILLIS IS REPORTEDLY STILL IN CRITICAL CONDITION</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors have given an update on the condition of former NFL running back Peyton Hillis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Hillis was rushed to the hospital after a swimming incident at a Florida beach. He reportedly rescued his two children who were in danger of drowning in the ocean. Both children were reportedly uninjured in the incident</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WREG Memphis reporter Otis Kirk reported that he had been told that Hillis is &ldquo;battling and definitely needs as many prayers as he can get.&rdquo; He also reported that the former Razorback&rsquo;s kidneys and lungs were the primary reasons why he was still in the hospital. WREG&rsquo;s report mentioned that Hillis&rsquo; kidneys are now the main concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirk did not reveal who gave him this information or their relationship with Hillis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He played both high school and college football in the state, before embarking on an NFL career that took him to Cleveland, Denver, New York, and Kansas City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at Arkansas, Hillis was one part of a running back triumvirate comprised of himself, Darren McFadden, and Felix Jones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report on Hillis&rsquo; condition comes just as a prayer vigil was being held in his native Arkansas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillis volunteers as an assistant for his son&rsquo;s football team. Bryant Davis, who is coach and head of the program, was at the vigil and spoke to KSFM-TV. He talked about the importance of community support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;One of the great things about being a body of believers is relationship and community, and it&rsquo;s about being not only here to pray for people, but it&rsquo;s also here, Bryant said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also to be here to support them through times like this.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On today&rsquo;s show Tom introduces the topic of atheism and its various types. Drawing from John Gray&rsquo;s book: Seven Types of Atheism, the conversation unpacks and engages each type mentioned by Gray. Noting how not all atheisms are the same, the guys critically interact with each, showing the various kinds of challenges each bring to the cultural context. The result is a rich conversation around unbelief and it&rsquo;s weaker and more challenging forms which require a more substantive theological critique.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republican files articles of impeachment against DHS Sec. Mayorkas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon has filed impeachment articles against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, delivering on a promise he made last week before the 118th Congress was officially sworn in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The articles of impeachment against Mayorkas for "high crimes and misdemeanors," known as House Resolution 8, were introduced by Fallon in the House on Monday and have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Fallon vowed to file impeachment articles against Mayorkas after the Congress was sworn in. The effort from Republicans in the House is one of many that the new GOP majority will take as it works to fight the Biden administration on issues related to immigration and the southern border crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is currently no text available for the impeachment articles filed against Mayorkas, Fox News reported last week that Fallon's first article alleges that Mayorkas has failed to faithfully execute the "Secure the Fence Act of 2006." The article says that law requires the secretary of Homeland Security to "maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second article alleges that Mayorkas, "in violation of his constitutional oath, willfully provided perjurious, false, and misleading testimony to Congress." To back up that charge, the article quotes Mayorkas' testimony during April 26 and Nov. 15 congressional hearings in which he said the border was secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final of the three articles charges that Mayorkas "publicly and falsely slandered" border agents who were accused &ndash; but later cleared &ndash; of whipping Haitian migrants in Del Rio, Texas, in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayorkas on Sunday said he will not resign over his handling of the border crisis and insisted he will be ready for future investigations by House Republicans while continuing to fulfill his daily responsibilities.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reps. Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell, Ilhan Omar To Officially Be Kicked Off Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committees</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy confirmed Monday night that Democratic California Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell will be removed from the House Intelligence Committee and the House will vote on the removal of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, McCarthy told the Daily Caller that if he is elected Speaker that he intends to strip Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee and Swalwell and Schiff from the Intelligence Committee. On Monday, McCarthy confirmed to The Associated Press (AP) that he would be moving forward with that decision, saying both Swalwell and Schiff should not have seats on the committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy has said Swalwell&rsquo;s reported relationship with a Chinese spy and Schiff&rsquo;s defense of the Steele dossier are some of the reasons they should be removed from the committee. McCarthy has said Omar&rsquo;s anti-Semitism is a reason she should be removed from Foreign Affairs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Swalwell can&rsquo;t get a security clearance in the private sector. I&rsquo;m not going to give him a government security clearance. Schiff has lied to the American public&hellip;,&rdquo; McCarthy told The AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Caller contacted Swalwell, Schiff, and Omar&rsquo;s offices about McCarthy&rsquo;s decision to move forward and have them removed from committee assignments to which they did not immediately respond.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Tate to remain in Romanian jail after losing appeal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former kickboxer and controversial social media personality Andrew Tate lost his appeal against not being held for 30 days at a Romanian detention center. Andrew, along with his brother Tristan, were detained last month pending a criminal investigation into alleged human trafficking and organizing a crime group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A document from the judge who instated the 30-day detention wrote that "the possibility of them evading investigations cannot be ignored" and the suspects could "leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition," reports Mirror.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In this sense, I would like to point out, at least from this point of view, I am also somehow amazed, there is not a single piece of evidence apart from the victim's statement that leads to the idea that a crime of rape was committed. In my view, there is no evidence to the formation of an opinion of reasonable suspicion regarding the commission of offenses provided for and punishable by criminal law. In this case we are talking about human trafficking and organized crime," said the Tate brothers' lawyer Eugen Vidineac.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon pledges to affirm sex changes for kids as reading proficiency plummets</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Oregon Department of Education released guidance for schools to better support "Gender Expansive Students" that include bathroom and pronoun policies aligned with radical gender ideology and include links for minors to seek "gender-affirming healthcare"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LibsofTikTok posted "Oregon Dept of Education released new guidelines on affirming LGBTQ+ students. They promote the use of pronouns, using bathrooms based on gender identity, and support 'gender affirming care' for minors. It also provides links to kids with info on 'tucking' &amp; 'chest binding'."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon Department of Education Director Colt Gill said, "It is our responsibility to move beyond mere tolerance and inclusion toward respectful, affirming, and celebratory school communities where all students belong and succeed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new guidance comes as a growing number of Oregon students are falling behind in their reading proficiency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Oregon Live, "A staggering 61 percent of third graders and 54 percent of seventh graders aren&rsquo;t fully proficient at reading, including 30 percent of seventh-graders found to be substantially below grade level" in the Beaver State.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures of success according to the guidance include telling students, "You have the ability to change your first name in your school record and student information system, without legal documentation" and "You have the ability to change your sex/gender marker in your school record and student information system."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You have the ability to use school restrooms and changing rooms that align with your gender identity or safety needs," according to the guidance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance also includes informing students they can "date who you want, if you want" and can form student groups focused on LGBTQ2SIA+.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan offers textbooks and guidance to students so they can learn "inclusive and affirming information about the LGBTQ2SIA+" community and inform the students they can participate in "sports, PE, and school activities according to your gender identity."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"If you are 15 or older, you have the ability to seek gender-affirming healthcare from an Oregon medical provider," according to the list of resources, which also remind students they can seek mental health resources if they are 14 or over and get birth control if they are "any age."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance provides a detailed list instructing students where they can receive "gender affirming care" that includes details on "tucking" and "chest binding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent guidance release is part of Oregon's larger LGBTQ2SIA+ Student Success Plan that was developed in 2020 "amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/irs-chopping-block-first-day-legislative-work-speaker-mccarthy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/irs-chopping-block-first-day-legislative-work-speaker-mccarthy</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS on the chopping block on first day of legislative work under Speaker McCarthy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House of Representatives is slated to vote on a bill Monday night that would cut more than $70 billion in Internal Revenue Service funding in an effort to prevent the agency from conducting new audits on Americans &mdash; fulfilling newly elected House Speaker Kevin McCarthy&rsquo;s promise ahead of taking the gavel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act from Reps. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., and Michelle Steel, R-Calif., would roll back the billions of dollars of funding for the IRS that was approved in the Inflation Reduction Act last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith&rsquo;s bill leaves in place funding for customer service and improvements to IT services at the IRS but rescinds several categories of unobligated funding, including money that could be used to conduct any new audits on Americans. In total, it would claw back $72 billion of the funding Congress approved for the IRS last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inflation Reduction Act granted an $80 billion boost to the IRS over a 10-year period, and more than half of those funds were aimed at helping the agency crack down on tax evasion. In 2021, the Treasury Department estimated that $80 billion would be used to hire 87,000 auditors and other new staff. Republicans have said they would fight this aggressive expansion that would more than double the agency&rsquo;s current size.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The last thing the American people need right now are more audits from an out-of-control, bloated IRS," Smith told Fox News Digital on Monday. "The Inflation Act funding for IRS would lead to the hiring of 87,000 new IRS employees tasked with raising enough revenue to pay for Democrats&rsquo; Green New Deal priorities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital just days before the midterm elections, McCarthy vowed that if he became speaker of the House, protecting Americans from the IRS would be his first order of business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whats-house-rules-package-tough-limits-federal-spending"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whats-house-rules-package-tough-limits-federal-spending</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What's in it: House GOP rules package aims to curb trillions in yearly heaps of new debt</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 55-page set of rules for the House that Speaker Kevin McCarthy hopes to pass on Monday will set ambitious new curbs on federal spending, part of the GOP's effort to stop piling on trillions of dollars in new debt each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest changes is a return to a "Cut-As-You-Go" policy that says legislation cannot be considered if it increases mandatory spending over a 5- or 10-year period. This "CUTGO" policy requires bills that call for new spending to find offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the federal budget.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is a more aggressive stance compared to the "Pay-As-You-Go" policy under Democratic control. "PAYGO" also requires offsets to new spending, but those offsets can either be spending cuts or tax increases &ndash; and in either case, PAYGO rules were often waived entirely by Democrats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to go with CUTGO shows the new GOP&rsquo;s aversion to possible tax hikes, which can be seen elsewhere in the new rules package. For example, the rules require a supermajority in the House to approve new tax increases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"A bill or joint resolution, amendment, or conference report carrying a federal income tax rate increase may not be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a vote of not less than three-fifths of the Members voting, a quorum being present," the rules state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another push to stop piling on new debt, the rules will end the practice of allowing the House to automatically increase the debt ceiling through passage of a budget resolution that would require borrowing above the current ceiling. Instead, the GOP will require separate votes to raise the debt ceiling in a bid to restore accountability to Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current debt ceiling is $31.38 trillion, and the government is on the verge of hitting that cap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules package also instructs House committees to prepare plans for strict oversight of the Biden administration, including an assessment of which programs continue to receive funding from Congress even though their authorization lapsed. It calls on committees to make recommendations on how to either consolidate or terminate those programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The package brings back the so-called Holman Rule, which allows members to chop specific agencies or even the salaries of specific federal employees when appropriations bills are being considered.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter was pressured by Pfizer to suppress posts questioning Covid vax efficacy: Twitter Files</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Berenson dropped records from the Twitter Files on Monday, stating that a board member for Pfizer pressured Twitter to suppress and censor any posts questioning the efficacy of the company's mRNA vaccine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 27, 2021, Pfizer Board Member Dr. Scott Gottlieb emailed Todd O&rsquo;Boyle, a Senior Manager of Public Policy at Twitter&rsquo;s Washington, DC location, according to LinkedIn, and also Twitter&rsquo;s point of contact with the White House, Berenson reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email subject line contained a tweet from Dr. Brett Giroir, who had briefly served under Gottlieb in the Food and Drug Administration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That tweet read: "It&rsquo;s now clear that [Covid-19] natural immunity is superior to [vaccine] immunity, by ALOT. There&rsquo;s no scientific justification for [vax proof] if a person had prior infection."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Declares State of Emergency in California After Deadly Storms</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in California on Jan. 9 after a series of storms hit the Golden State, leaving about a dozen people dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several storms, as part of an &ldquo;atmospheric river,&rdquo; have hit California over the past two weeks and caused hundreds of thousands of customers to lose power, according to Poweroutage.us. As of the morning of Jan. 9, the website shows that more than 100,000 people are without power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Dec. 26, 2022, San Francisco has received more than 10 inches of rain, while Mammoth Mountain, a popular ski area in the Eastern Sierra, got nearly 10 feet of snow, the National Weather Service said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergency declaration allows the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and use emergency resources, the White House said in a Jan. 9 statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, who&rsquo;s currently in Mexico, declared that an &ldquo;emergency exists&rdquo; in California following &ldquo;successive and severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides.&rdquo; FEMA is authorized to provide &ldquo;equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency,&rdquo; according to the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, in anticipation of more storms, the National Weather Service warned of a &ldquo;relentless parade of atmospheric rivers&rdquo; that will likely hit California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second storm system will hit on Jan. 10 with lower rainfall totals but will affect locations in Southern California, according to the federal agency. Heavy snow of as much as six feet will fall across higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains, located in the eastern portion of California, before tapering off on Jan. 11.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will likely be &ldquo;additional instances of flooding&rdquo; across California this week, according to the agency.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian anti-Lula protestors storm presidential palace and National Congress</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The headquarters of Brazil's executive and legislative branches were stormed by demonstrators protesting against the election of socialist President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva on Sunday, breaking into the presidential palace as well as the National Congress building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pal&aacute;cio do Planalto, or Planalto Palace in English, is the workplace of Brazilian presidents, and is located in the same plaza as the National Congress of Brazil, as well as the Supreme Federal Court. The Pra&ccedil;a dos Tr&ecirc;s Poderes, or Three Towers Plaza, is in the capital city of Bras&iacute;lia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian outlet Metropoles reports that a hundreds of "Bolsonarists," or supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, "broke through blocks that prevent the entry of non-accredited people and entered the Planalto parking lot," before eventually making their way into the Planalto Palace and National Congress buildings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footage shared by American conservative activist ALX shows the moment protestors broke through the barrier as police attempted to subdue them. Eventually the police had to retreat while the crowd stormed through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video from inside the Planalto Palace shows the protestors, decked out in patriotic outfits, walking through the gas around the offices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 2:40 pm, the protestors also entered the National Congress building under a "shower of tear gas bombs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More footage shows masses of protestors climbing up the ramps on the outside of the congressional building to get inside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Bolsonaro is suspected to have been in Orlando, Florida, since December, reported The Hill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diario 98 columnist George Marques reported that while the buildings were being invaded, a portion of the Bolsonaro supporters stayed behind to pray.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lula, who was inaugurated just one week ago, won 50.83 percent of the vote compared to conservative incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who won 49.17, in the country's October 2 vote. There was a runoff election afterwards on October 30 which Lula won, and that win was immediately ratified by the Superior Electoral Court.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;God&rsquo;s Real&rsquo;: Bills Quarterback Josh Allen Fights Back Tears While Recounting &lsquo;Spiritual&rsquo; Moment on Field as Damar Hamlin Recovers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been a harrowing, terrifying, and yet oddly optimistic time for the Buffalo Bills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, just shy of a week after Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed and went into cardiac arrest during a football showdown between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals, the Bills returned to the field and won against the New England Patriots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that was only a bonus to the amazing news Hamlin is recovering and was able to watch the game from his hospital bed, sharing in the joy the 35-23 victory brought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamlin&rsquo;s healing has been an answer to prayer for a nation on the edge of its seat, wondering if the 24-year-old player &mdash; whose initial medical state was dire &mdash; would pull through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That emotional toll was palpable, particularly after the Bills&rsquo; win Sunday. Quarterback Josh Allen delivered an emotional statement and gave God all the glory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It was just spiritual &hellip; I was going around my team and saying, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s real,'&rdquo; Allen said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t draw that one, write that one up any better.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He continued, as he got emotional, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been three years and three months since the last kickoff return.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allen was addressing the first play of the game, a 96-yard kickoff return &mdash; a resulting touchdown that left the Bills in celebration. The significance here, of course, is Hamlin&rsquo;s number, which is 3.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&rsquo;s the great Jim Nantz and Tony Romo on the call:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1612148627904032768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1612148627904032768</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the players coming out donning Hamlin&rsquo;s number, Allen clearly saw significance in the fact it had also been three years and three months since that last kickoff return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allen also said during the post-game news conference he can&rsquo;t remember another play that impacted him in such a profound way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You want the truth? It was spiritual. It really was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bone-chilling. It was special. I can&rsquo;t remember a play that touched me like that in my life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that today&hellip; is why I love sports.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/matt-gaetz-continue-speaker-stalemate-until-mccarthy-concedes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/matt-gaetz-continue-speaker-stalemate-until-mccarthy-concedes</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Gaetz vows to continue speaker stalemate until McCarthy concedes or limits power</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Rep. Kevin McCarthy&rsquo;s most stubborn opponents in his House speaker bid is vowing not to fold and to continue the current stalemate until the California Republican either agrees to the defectors&rsquo; demands or drops out altogether.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who has been one of McCarthy&rsquo;s most vocal opponents, pledged not to back down in the House speaker showdown, intensifying what has already been a dayslong fight as the chamber looks to elect its next leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think this ends one of two ways,&rdquo; Gaetz told Fox News after the House adjourned on Wednesday. &ldquo;Either Kevin bows out, realizing there is no path to become speaker of the House even with one or two or three or five of the 20 who have opposed him half a dozen times on the floor, or he essentially has to wake up, bring the House into session, and put on a straitjacket with a rules package that we&rsquo;ve presented to him that doesn&rsquo;t allow a lot of discretion for the speaker of the House.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After failing to make headway in three rounds of roll call votes on Wednesday, McCarthy proposed a new bout of concessions to some of his most stubborn opponents in a last-ditch effort to win their support before the chamber reconvenes. As part of his latest concessions, McCarthy agreed to a proposal to add more Freedom Caucus members to the House Rules Committee, as well as further lowering the number of members needed to call for a floor vote to oust a sitting speaker, according to CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compromise builds on previous concessions in which McCarthy agreed to lower the number of votes needed to oust him from the position possibly should he be elected, marking a significant win for far-right conservatives such as Gaetz.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The reason we&rsquo;ve demanded that is we do not trust Kevin McCarthy, and it&rsquo;s not a small body of work,&rdquo; the Florida Republican said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if those demands are met, however, Gaetz has vowed not to back McCarthy&rsquo;s bid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty GOP lawmakers voted against McCarthy to back Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) in the latest round of voting, with one Republican voting present. Donalds initially voted for McCarthy in the first two roll call votes before backing Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) in the third round on Tuesday, conceding that &ldquo;at the end of the day, we&rsquo;ve got to get to 218."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/black-couple-given-plot-of-land-in-reparations-sells-it-back-to-la-for-20-million?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/black-couple-given-plot-of-land-in-reparations-sells-it-back-to-la-for-20-million?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black couple given plot of land in reparations sells it back to LA for $20 million</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heirs to Bruce's Beach, the prime beachfront property in California's Manhattan Beach, have sold the land back to the county for $20 million after receiving it just over a year ago in an act of restorative justice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The direct descendants of the black couple who were run off of their land and business got a form of "reparations," according to LA County.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1912, Charles and Willa Bruce, a black couple, bought the plot of land for $1,225 and opened up a black beach club, reported the Los Angeles Times. These clubs were common in southern California during that period, when segregation kept black people out of "whites-only" beaches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing mounting pressure from racist individuals and groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, city officials condemned the property to eminent domain in 1924, claiming that they needed it to build a park.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Los Angeles County website, no park was actually built until nearly 30 years later, and the real reason for seizing the land was racially motivated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It is well documented that the real reason behind the eminent domain process was racially motivated with the intention of bringing an end to the successful Black business and to thwart other African Americans from settling in or developing businesses in Manhattan Beach," the government site reads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county ended up forcing the black couple off of their land, paying them only $14,000 when the plot was actually valued at $70,000, according to Daily Mail. The Bruces left the beach and closed their business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their family, they never financially recovered. In July 2022, LA County returned the land to direct descendants Marcus and Derrick Bruce as well as Derrick's sons, Anthony and Michael.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It destroyed their chance at the American Dream. I wish they could see what has happened today," Anthony said when the land was finally returned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, it was announced that the Bruces had opted to cash out on the land instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Janice Hahn, stated that the selling of the land will help rebuild "generational wealth" that the family lost out on after their great-grandparents' business was destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This fight has always been about what is best for the Bruce family, and they feel what is best for them is selling this property back to the county for nearly $20 million and finally rebuilding the generational wealth they were denied for nearly a century," she said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is what reparations look like and it is a model that I hope government across the country will follow," the county official added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Non-Binary&rsquo; Founder of Indigenous Artists&rsquo; Collective Accused of Faking Native American Heritage</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-owner of a &ldquo;queer Indigenous artists&rsquo; collective&rdquo; in Wisconsin reportedly faked her Native American background and &ldquo;used the front to make money,&rdquo; the New York Post reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kay LeClaire, a woman who identifies as &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; was accused in an online forum of being white after claiming for years that she was of Metis, Oneida, Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Cuban and German descent. LeClaire is a founding member of an art collective and is well-known in the Indigenous arts community in Madison, Wisconsin. LeClaire went by the Indigenous name &ldquo;Nibiiwakamigkwe,&rdquo; the Post noted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reportedly, LeClaire earned artist stipends, a paid residency at the University of Wisconsin, paid speaking gigs, and art exhibitions based on her Native American background. But, a &ldquo;hobbyist genealogist&rdquo; who did not reveal their identity posted evidence of LeClaire&rsquo;s real ancestry on an online forum. It showed that LeClaire is of German, Swedish, and French Canadian descent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; LeClaire reportedly told local outlet Madison365. &ldquo;A lot of information has come to my attention since late December. I am still processing it all and do not yet know how to respond adequately. What I can do now is offer change.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The art collective said in an Instagram post that it had parted ways with LeClaire on Dec. 31, 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anonymous user who published LeClaire&rsquo;s ancestry online went by the screen name &ldquo;AdvancedSmite.&rdquo; They spoke with Madison365 and revealed they are of Native American heritage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Townhall reported that several high-profile activists had been caught pretending to have Native American ancestry, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Canadian academic Carrie Bourassa, and actress Sacheen Littlefeather, whose sisters came forward late last year after her death to reveal that she was of Mexican descent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny&rsquo; Reportedly Pacing Far Behind &lsquo;Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts&rsquo; And &lsquo;Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3&rsquo; In Audience Interest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report from Puck&rsquo;s Matthew Belloni claims that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny significantly underperformed compared to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 after the three films released trailers during Brazil Comic Con back at the beginning of December.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to studio source Belloni reports that Transformers: Rise of the Beasts racked up over 506 million views in two weeks across YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 drew in 187 million views while Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny only brought in 79 million views.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a peek at the YouTube numbers, as of today, the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny trailer only has 10 million views on the Lucasfilm YouTube channel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transformers: Rise of the Beasts has 26.3 million views on the official Paramount Pictures YouTube channel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 isn&rsquo;t trailing Transformers: Rise of the Beasts as much as Belloni reported after two weeks, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is still significantly off the pace compared to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, both films have more than doubled up on trailer views compared to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is not only trailing these films when it comes to trailer views as noted by both Belloni&rsquo;s inside source as well as spot-checking YouTube, but Belloni also claims the film is already at a disadvantage because Stephen Spielberg is not directing the film and Harrison Ford is 80 years old and is supposedly the leading man in a film franchise known for its action adventure heroics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film&rsquo;s promotion has also been plagued by director James Mangold&rsquo;s antagonistic behavior to concerned fans about what he and Lucasfilm have planned for the film.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucasfilm has a track record of destroying their male-led franchises, one needs only look at the the desecration of Han Solo in The Force Awakens that turned his character into a deadbeat dad, who then gets murdered by his own son.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This anti-male theme would be doubled down on in Rian Johnson&rsquo;s The Last Jedi that shows Luke Skywalker as a man who has abandoned everything he believed in and even tosses his lightsaber away like a piece of garbage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This theme is not isolated to the sequel trilogies, The Mandalorian turns what was pitched as a ruthless bounty hunter living in the outer reaches of the galaxy into a glorified baby sitter for a child-like Yoda character that is apparently not a child at all. The Book of Boba Fett also turned the famed bounty hunter into an incompetent town manager.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this track record, fans have a healthy skepticism of what Lucasfilm and Mangold will do to the franchise and have especially had their hackles up following the casting of self-proclaimed feminist Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to one fan concern, Mangold decided to attack him and then proceeded to lie about his attacks on the fan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Kadish shared his concerns writing on Twitter, &ldquo;To anyone thinking Indiana Jones 5 might be good, just let me point out&hellip; 1. Steven Spielberg is not directing. 2. Kathleen Kennedy is producing. 3. Harrison Ford is 78 years old. 4. It&rsquo;s written by Jonathan Kasdan, who wrote SOLO.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mangold responded writing, &ldquo;Thanks, Matt! 1) Keep making the world a better place crapping on things in the 1st week of production from your basement. 2) Never seen a script by Jon. Nothing against him. Just reality. Butterworths &amp; I started from a blank page. 3) 1-3 r hugely talented &amp; all at my side.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny does not appear to be connecting to people via trailer views and on top of that it has an antagonistic director who not only confirmed fan fears about Lucasfilm&rsquo;s production are legitimate, but he&rsquo;s openly degrading them for expressing such concerns.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden says it's his 'intention' to visit US-Mexico border amid historic crisis</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden says it's his "intention" to visit the U.S-Mexico border amid a record high number of border crossings, according to a report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden made the comments Wednesday at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, saying that it's his "intention" to visit the border during his trip to the North American Leaders' Summit on Jan. 9-10, which will include meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visit would mark Biden's first trip to the border during his presidency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People familiar with discussions surrounding the potential visit told the Wall Street Journal that Biden will not be making a policy announcement if he visits the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential trip comes amid a record-breaking crisis at the southern border, with 617, 250 total migrant encounters occurring so far in FY 2023 as of Dec. 29, 2022, according to Customs and Border Protection sources, adding that there's an average of 6,858 encounters per day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In FY 2022, migrant encounters reached 2.3 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 6, Biden said that "there are more important things going on" when asked why he'd visit a border state but not the U.S. -Mexico border itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has pushed for Title 42 &mdash; the pandemic-era policy which allows immigration officers to quickly remove migrants from the country on the basis of public health &mdash; to be lifted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled in favor of immigration advocates and gave Title 42 an end date of Dec. 21, the Supreme Court temporarily halted the policy's termination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without providing evidence, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in November that Biden has been to the border.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;White House Defends COVID Travel Restrictions as Beijing Threatens &lsquo;Countermeasures&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House is defending its decision to issue travel restrictions related to COVID-19 following several threats from China&rsquo;s communist regime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration said there was no cause for retaliation from Beijing after its communist leadership criticized Washington&rsquo;s decision to require a negative COVID-19 test from those who travel from China to the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no cause for retaliation here just because countries around the world are taking prudent health measures to protect their citizens,&rdquo; White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a Jan. 3 press conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which rules China as a single-party state, announced that it will reopen its borders on Jan. 8. The move comes just one month after the regime abruptly terminated its zero-COVID policy in response to mass unrest, causing cases of COVID-19 to surge throughout China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move prompted a global outcry, and nations around the world are hurrying to put in place testing requirements for all arrivals from China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Dec. 28, 2022, saying that passengers would need to present a negative COVID-19 test result or proof of recovery before boarding a U.S.-bound flight from China. The CDC said the move was meant to &ldquo;slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States during the surge in COVID-19 cases in the PRC [People&rsquo;s Republic of China] given the lack of adequate and transparent epidemiological and viral genomic sequence data being reported from the PRC.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States joins the UK, Australia, Canada, France, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Malaysia, Qatar, and other nations seeking to place stronger restrictions on arrivals from China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the CCP said that the testing requirements were &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and vowed that the regime would &ldquo;take countermeasures&rdquo; against nations that issue travel restrictions on flights originating in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House defended the decision to require testing from all China-originating travelers based on the international consensus that COVID-19 is currently ravaging China&rsquo;s populace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s funny though&hellip; anyone remember when Trump shut down travel to China?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CCP has attempted to cover up the scale of COVID-19 infections in China and the number of deaths it&rsquo;s causing among the Chinese population, which has no natural immunity following almost three years of constant lockdowns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaked images of papers from a CCP conference in December 2022 revealed that Party authorities believe that as many as 248 million Chinese became infected within the first 20 days of December. Publicly, the regime claims that only 10 people died from the disease throughout the month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s generally what happens when you don&rsquo;t allow for herd immunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://bigleaguepolitics.com/report-at-least-769-recently-vaxxed-athletes-collapsed-last-year-during-competition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://bigleaguepolitics.com/report-at-least-769-recently-vaxxed-athletes-collapsed-last-year-during-competition/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report: At Least 769 Recently Vaxxed Athletes Collapsed Last Year During Competition</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the underlying stories of 2022 is the enormous number of professional athletes &ndash; primarily men with an average age of 23 &ndash; collapsing during competition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many of these instances have been documented in singular reports. Mainstream media outlets appear reluctant to link this unprecedented surge in collapses to the Covid-19 jab. Or to even bother asking follow up questions as to why or how this is happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially suspicious considering the majority of these collapsing instances involved recently vaccinated and or boosted athletes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One America News Network (OAN) did some digging and discovered more than 769 athletes have collapsed on the field during a game from March 2021 to March 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As outlined by The Defender, this spike &ldquo;in cardiac arrest and other heart issues among elite athletes coincides with the rollout of COVID-19 jabs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pearson Sharp of OAN asks:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many 23-year-old athletes were collapsing and suffering heart attacks before this year? Do you know any 23-year-old people who had heart attacks before now? And these are just the ones we know about. How many have gone unreported?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 800 athletes &mdash; young, fit people in the prime of life &mdash; falling down on the field. In fact, 500% more soccer players in the EU are dropping dead from heart attacks than just one year ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharp discussed how this unprecedented surge is not a coincidence. Especially because &ldquo;the Pfizer vaccine is known to cause heart inflammation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also alluded to the fact this number may be grossly underreported.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for these unreliable figures stems from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) showing only between 1 and 10% of adverse reactions according to past investigations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Warner, for example, is an athlete who filed a VAERS report about his own health injuries following the COVID-19 jab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Dr. Joseph Mercola put it; the filing took Warner 45 minutes &ndash; &ldquo;a length of time that many doctors can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t devote when it comes to reporting adverse vaccine reactions seen among their patients.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, elite athletes collapsing in game increased so much in 2022 that even a mainstream media sports channel in Australia has speculated that the health issues could be linked to COVID-19 shots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1513542808531046409"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1513542808531046409</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this number steadily grows, mainstream outlets appear to be ignoring these collapses and their potential linkage to the Covd-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the White House and other institutions continue pushing for more to take the experimental jab and get boosted.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/two-thirds-of-us-big-bank-economists-predict-a-recession-for-2023?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/two-thirds-of-us-big-bank-economists-predict-a-recession-for-2023?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recession predicted in 2023 for US economy by economists at major banks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-thirds of top economists at the United States' largest financial institutions are predicting a recession in 2023, according to a survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary concerns cited in the survey of 23 primary dealers, including those from Barclays PLC, Bank of America Corp, TD Securities, and UBS Group AG, were a dwindling of pandemic savings, a decline in the housing market, and a tightening of lending rules as potential warning signs of an incoming recession.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prediction follows a year of soaring inflation, accompanied by rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve that have risen from nearly zero in March, to 4.5 percent by the year's end. The Federal Reserve reportedly plans to continue its increase to 5 percent, then 5.5 percent in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists predict that this will force unemployment rates above five percent, resulting in millions of Americans losing their jobs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank doesn't forecast a decline in interest rates until 2024 at the earliest, as it attempts a balancing act of attempting to lower inflation levels without triggering a recession.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation began to increase at the beginning of 2022, rising at its fastest pace in 40 years. It currently sits at three times the government's preferred rate of two percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans' savings during the pandemic from decreased spending and government stimulus measures have started to dwindle, as consumers increasingly dig in to weather rising prices of most products, from groceries to gas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Households have also increasingly had to take out lines of credit to afford their lives, as total household borrowing increased by $351 billion between the second and third quarter, to a total of $16.51 trillion, the fastest increase in 14 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high interest rates have hit the housing market particularly hard, as mortgage rates continue to soar and home sales plummeted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks have also significantly tightened their lending standards, more often than not an indicator of an incoming recession.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the 23 primary dealers surveyed, only five believed that there would not be a recession: Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, and Morgan Stanley.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Schwartz, Senior US Economist at Credit Suisse, one of the five banks that didn't predict a recession, wrote of the outlook for 2023, "Several historically reliable lead indicators are sending recession signals, but in our view these measures are unable to correctly gauge recession risk in the current environment."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/zelenskyy-warns-russia-planning-prolonged-attack-iranian-shahed-drones"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/zelenskyy-warns-russia-planning-prolonged-attack-iranian-shahed-drones</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy warns Russia planning &lsquo;prolonged&rsquo; attack with Iranian Shahed drones</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Kyiv has gained intelligence suggesting that Russia is planning a prolonged attack by using Iranian-supplied Shahed drones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an overnight address Monday, Zelenskyy warned that in the two days since the world welcomed in 2023, Ukraine has stopped more than 80 drone strikes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy said that Russia is looking to exhaust "our people, our air defense, our energy sector" by constantly pummeling the country with air strikes &ndash; a strategy Moscow has been employing for months but which it has escalated as winter sets in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive," he said addressing Ukrainian pilots and those in charge of air defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow and Tehran, Iran, have repeatedly denied any drone partnership or the use of Iranian supplied drones in Ukraine despite evidence supplied by Kyiv and backed by Western defense officials.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy urged his forces on the front lines, particularly those fighting in areas like Bakhmut &ndash; which has seen intense ground warfare for months &ndash; to continue to hold the line amid harsh winter conditions, which has likely slowed fighting in other areas like Kherson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian forces have continued to push the lines eastward in areas like Donetsk, and fighting has begun to intensify in the Donbas region where Russian backed forces have fought since 2014.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine&rsquo;s Armed Forces championed this week that Ukrainian forces have liberated 40% of the territory Russia occupied following its invasion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said that in the regions where Russian forces remain Moscow has lost roughly 28% of the land.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for my favorite topic, sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a listen to ESPN football analyst Dan Orlovsky on the hospitalized Damar Hamlin:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Vs59RDITc"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;ESPN's Dan Orlovsky Praying for Damar Hamlin on NFL Live&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Vs59RDITc&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">ESPN's Dan Orlovsky Praying for Damar Hamlin on NFL Live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Play video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That took place on ESPN ladies and gentleman. This is why I love sports&hellip; sports has gone woke in recent years, but it&rsquo;s situations like this, that bring people together&hellip; God is always at work, but it&rsquo;s amazing to see His handiwork in this situation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI Paid Twitter $3.4 Million to Ban Accounts for &lsquo;Misinformation&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Bureau of Investigation paid Twitter $3.4 million to ban or suspend accounts for &ldquo;foreign influence&rdquo; and &ldquo;misinformation&rdquo; on the social media platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI has been policing speech on the social media site for years, eventually paying Twitter the money as reimbursement for the work, The New York Post reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inner workings of Twitter and its cooperation with federal authorities have been coming out in tranches released by independent journalist Matt Taibbi &mdash; what have become known as the Twitter Files &mdash; since business magnate Elon Musk took over Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taibbi has been tweeting and The Post has been reporting screenshots of emails between the FBI and Twitter staff, with FBI flagging specific accounts for alleged &ldquo;civic misinformation policy violations,&rdquo; &ldquo;spam behaviors,&rdquo; &ldquo;platform manipulation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ban evasion,&rdquo; asking Twitter to suspend or ban users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The files show that Twitter held monthly meetings with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, The Post reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI and other federal agencies focused on social media after the 2016 election, Taibbi noted on Twitter, as the FBI&rsquo;s social media task force grew to 80 agents and Department of Homeland Security worked with outside security contractors and think tanks &ldquo;to pressure Twitter to moderate content.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapper Zuby identifies as female to smash weightlifting record</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has become an unlikely feminist icon: the weightlifting hip-hop artist and Oxford graduate who set out to demonstrate that athletes who are genetically male should not be competing alongside women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapper, whose stage name is Zuby, was filmed last week smashing the British women&rsquo;s deadlift record, in which the weights are raised from the ground to thigh level, while he said he was &ldquo;identifying as a woman&rdquo;. The video has had almost 1m views on Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 32-year-old later beat the UK women&rsquo;s bench press record too, joking that his work was &ldquo;strong, stunning and brave&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes amid a debate about the participation of transgender athletes in sport.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics including the tennis champion Martina Navratilova, who is a long-term campaigner for LGBT&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/idaho-murder-suspect-arrives-in-pennsylvania-court"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/idaho-murder-suspect-arrives-in-pennsylvania-court</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho murders suspect Bryan Kohberger arrives in Pennsylvania court for extradition hearing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suspect in the quadruple murders at the University of Idaho arrived on Tuesday in court in Pennsylvania, where he is expected to waive extradition and be transported to Idaho for a criminal trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Kohberger, 28, arrived at the Pennsylvania court in handcuffs Tuesday morning and is scheduled to appear before a judge at 3:30 p.m., according to the Daily Mail. The hearing won't be livestreamed, but a group of journalists and photographers will be permitted inside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kohberger, who is accused of killing four university students in their off-campus home in November, is expected not to challenge his extradition to Idaho, with his state-appointed attorney calling Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing a &ldquo;formality proceeding.&rdquo; Kohberger is likely to plead not guilty in the case, and his attorney has said he &ldquo;believes he&rsquo;s going to be exonerated.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kohberger was arrested on Friday in connection to the quadruple slayings, with police saying they don&rsquo;t expect to make any other arrests in the case. Kohberger has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder, as well as felony burglary.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We believe we have our guy, the one that committed these murders,&rdquo; Moscow Police Chief James Fry told ABC News on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/guy-idaho-murders-police-chief-96025071"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/guy-idaho-murders-police-chief-96025071</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be extradited, law enforcement need only prove that Kohberger is the person on the Idaho arrest warrant and that he was in the area at the time of the murders, according to Monroe County Chief Public Defender Jason LaBar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kohberger is a doctoral student studying criminal justice at the Washington State University campus in Pullman, which is roughly 15 minutes away from the University of Idaho. The suspect had driven home to Pennsylvania with his father for the holidays, with the pair returning to the state around Dec. 17, according to LaBar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s still unclear Kohberger&rsquo;s connection to the victims in the quadruple slayings, and police have not identified a motive. The probable-cause affidavit that would provide these details is not set to be released until Kohberger arrives in Idaho.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington State University identifies Kohberger as a Ph.D. student in its department of criminal justice and criminology. He completed his first semester in its criminal justice program earlier this month, the university said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A white Hyundai Elantra spotted near the victims' house around the time of the crime is believed to be Kohberger's, Fry said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police had previously said they believe the occupant had "critical" information in the case. Police do not believe anyone else was in the car at the time, Fry said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement personnel seized the car from Kohberger's parents' Pennsylvania home and it is being processed, according to Fry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement sources told ABC News that police identified Kohberger as a suspect, at least in part, by using DNA technology, and police then tracked the grad student to Pennsylvania through his car.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow police's only other prior interaction with Kohberger was a traffic citation for not wearing a seatbelt, which was issued while he was in the white Elantra, Fry said. The chief said he cannot release whether the suspect has any prior criminal history elsewhere.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bills-damar-hamlin-collapses-field-medical-staff-appear-administer-cpr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bills-damar-hamlin-collapses-field-medical-staff-appear-administer-cpr</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damar Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest during game, heartbeat restored on field, Bills say</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest following a hit in Monday night&rsquo;s game against the Cincinnati Bengals causing him to collapse on the field, the team said Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bills said Hamlin&rsquo;s "heartbeat was restored on the field and he was transferred to the UC Medical Center for further testing and treatment."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He is currently sedated and listed in critical condition," the team said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scary incident occurred with 5:58 remaining in the first quarter and Cincinnati leading the game, 7-3. The Bengals were on their second drive of the game when quarterback Joe Burrow threw a pass to Tee Higgins. Bills safety Hamlin came over to make a tackle to end the play.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamlin was on the ground for a while as he received CPR from the medical staff on the ground before he was put into the ambulance. Hamlin was being rushed to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Buck &amp; Troy Aikman described the incident on ESPN:&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>A high level of expectancy fills the early pages and events of the New Testament Gospels. Herod, the Magi, Anna, Simeon, and "all of Jerusalem"&mdash;to name but a few&mdash;were all eager and expecting God to act. Thanks in part to the prophecies in Daniel and other prophets, Jerusalem was on edge before and after Jesus' birth. As we say goodbye to 2022 and welcome 2023, Christians need to be reminded that God is always "doing something," and to keep our own high level of expectancy and hope.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today Chris responds to the truism attributed to Francis Bacon, "Knowledge is power." The question he raises is, "If that is all there is to it, what does that imply--that forms of knowledge that don't lead to power are worthless, do they fail the test of knowledge then?" Chris warns, this is the road to totalitarianism. It isn't a fast road, necessarily--but it certainly gets you there eventually. Tune in to see what the Pugsters have to say about why the old truism isn't entirely true.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We bring our series in Thomas Aquinas to a close by restating six significant differences between Thomistic thought and the reformation worldview that we believe is more consistent with Scripture. On the question of origins, nature and grace, ontology and anthropology, apologetics and Christian philosophy, the medieval thought of Aquinas falls short of the biblical position.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-asks-supreme-court-end-title-42-short-delay-lifting-restrictions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-asks-supreme-court-end-title-42-short-delay-lifting-restrictions</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden admin asks Supreme Court to end Title 42, but with short delay on lifting restrictions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration on Tuesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to let the pandemic-era policy Title 42 come to end, but requested a brief delay until at least after Christmas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a filing on Tuesday, the administration acknowledged to the Supreme Court that the end of Title 42 will likely lead to "disruption and a temporary increase in unlawful border crossings" but asked the court to reject efforts by a group of conservative-leaning states to keep Title 42 in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migrants have been denied requests to seek asylum under U.S. and international law 2.5 million times since March 2020 on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19 under a public-health rule called Title 42.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-gov-abbott-polar-vortex-threatens-migrants-bidens-border-disaster"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-gov-abbott-polar-vortex-threatens-migrants-bidens-border-disaster</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Gov. Abbott warns polar vortex threatens migrants due to Biden&rsquo;s border &lsquo;disaster&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told President Joe Biden on Tuesday that his "disaster" immigration policy is putting lives at risk as a polar vortex expected this week will create bitter conditions for the thousands of illegal immigrants who continue to trek into the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"With cold temperatures gripping Texas, your inaction to secure the southern border is putting the lives of migrants at risk, particularly in the City of El Paso," the Republican governor told Biden in a letter. "Your policies will leave many people in the bitter, dangerous cold as a polar vortex moves into Texas."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This terrible crisis for border communities in Texas is a catastrophe of your own making," Abbott wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor said Biden has failed in his constitutional duty to protect the border, which disproportionately impacts Texas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott warned that the situation would only get worse if the Title 42 policy ends this week. That pandemic-era policy allows border agents to turn migrants away at the border, and ending it could lead to a surge of migrants at the southern border just as Texas faces some of its coldest temperatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Title 42 policy was set to expire Wednesday, but an appeal is being heard by the Supreme Court, which could decide as early as Tuesday evening. The Department of Homeland Security projects between 9,000 and 15,000 migrant encounters a day once the policy ends, which would add to the already highest annual total of encounters in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted an end to Title 42 would not mean the border is open. To suggest so, she said, is misinformation and "doing the work of these smugglers." Vice President Kamala Harris, who was tasked with identifying the root cause of mass migration to the southern border, has insisted in recent months that the border is secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott said he would continue to work with state-based officials to stem the tide of illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-confirms-zelenskyys-travel-us-ahead-massive-bill-funding-ukrainian-military"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-confirms-zelenskyys-travel-us-ahead-massive-bill-funding-ukrainian-military</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House confirms Zelenskyy's travel to US ahead of massive bill funding Ukrainian military</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration confirmed early Wednesday morning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on his way to the U.S. to discuss more assistance for the country during its ongoing conflict with Russia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to meeting with President Biden, Zelenskyy is slated to address Congress Wednesday afternoon as lawmakers plan to shell out more money for Ukraine in its latest $1.7 trillion spending bill. The budget includes more than $45 billion in new military and humanitarian aid for his country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A press statement from the Biden admin Wednesday morning said Zelenskyy's address to a joint meeting of Congress will demonstrate the "strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its official statement, the White House added President Biden has been rallying the world to support Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Three hundred days ago, Russia launched a brutal assault against Ukraine. In response, President Biden rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity," the statement read. "During the visit, President Biden will announce a significant new package of security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensive security measures were already underway in the nation's capital early Wednesday morning as the District prepared for the high-profile visit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 4:30 a.m., Capitol Police cruisers could be seen lined up outside the Capitol building along with cement barricades blocking roads leading up to the building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On behalf of bipartisan Congressional leaders, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent a letter to Zelenskyy encouraging his visit to Washington, D.C., in a letter explaining the leaders' "immense respect and admiration" for the Ukrainian president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending aid would be the U.S.' largest amount of financial assistance to Ukraine since the war started and is intended to support the fight against Russia for months to come, according to the Associated Press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress is also expected to announce a major package of $1.8 billion in military aid on Wednesday, which will include a Patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for Ukraine's fighter jets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. officials said the package will include about $1 billion in weapons from Pentagon stocks and $800 million in funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, according to the AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the massive spending bill is expected to receive support from many Republicans in the House and Senate, not all are on board with the additional funding. Some GOP lawmakers argued the new round of aid, which will bring the U.S. commitment to the war to over $110 billion, is improper without greater accountability.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-senate-advances-1-66-trillion-government-funding-bill_4936469.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-senate-advances-1-66-trillion-government-funding-bill_4936469.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Senate Advances $1.66 Trillion Government-Funding Bill</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $1.66 trillion government spending bill drew overwhelming bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday as lawmakers steered it toward passage before a weekend deadline to avoid a partial shutdown of federal agencies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic and Republican negotiators agreed early Tuesday morning on the sweeping bill to fund the federal government through the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, raising funding from about $1.5 trillion in the last fiscal year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate voted 70-25 to proceed to debate of the bill, with some Republican senators hoping to offer amendments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of conservative Senate Republicans on Tuesday said they objected to the bill, but would not try to stop its passage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill includes other measures agreed on by negotiators from both parties, including a ban on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices and clarification of Congress&rsquo;s role in certifying elections, an attempt to avoid a repeat of the U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate and House leaders aim to pass the 4,155-page bill and send it to Democratic President Joe Biden for signing by the end of the week to ensure there are no interruptions to the government&rsquo;s activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tuesday vote was the first in a series of steps clearing the way for passage by Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to pass legislation in time could bring a partial government shutdown beginning Saturday, just before Christmas, and possibly lead into a months-long standoff after Republicans take control of the House on Jan. 3, breaking the grip of Biden&rsquo;s Democrats on both chambers of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget experts found fault with the bill&rsquo;s size.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in the bill is $44.9 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies and $40.6 billion to assist communities across the United States recovering from natural disasters and other matters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ukraine funds would be used for military training, equipment, logistics and intelligence support, as well as for replenishing U.S. equipment sent to Kyiv. It also includes funding to prepare for and respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not ruled out the use of nuclear weapons in the conflict with Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in the Ukraine package is $13.4 billion in economic aid and $2.4 billion to help resettle Ukrainians in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The military aid would be on top of the record $858 billion in U.S. defense spending for the year, which is up from last year&rsquo;s $740 billion and also exceeds Biden&rsquo;s request.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. lawmakers also included a proposal to bar federal employees from using the Chinese short-video app TikTok on government-owned devices. And they backed a proposal to lift a looming deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of Boeing Co&rsquo;s 737 MAX aircraft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/20/intruder-able-to-walk-into-uvalde-school-unchallenged-during-safety-audit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/12/20/intruder-able-to-walk-into-uvalde-school-unchallenged-during-safety-audit/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Intruder&rsquo; able to walk into Uvalde school unchallenged as new report slams medical response</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Texas safety inspector posing as an intruder was recently able to stroll unchallenged into a Uvalde school &mdash; as a damning new investigation also blamed a &ldquo;flawed medical response&rdquo; for failing to save some of the 21 slaughtered in a mass shooting at Robb Elementary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspector was even able to enter through a back door that did not latch, eerily similar to how 18-year-old madman Salvador Ramos got into Robb Elementary before killing 19 fourth-graders and two teachers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shocking breach was revealed at a Uvalde school board meeting Monday night, attended by at least a dozen family members of victims of the May shooting, the San Antonio Express-News said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grieving loved ones were furious that &ldquo;somebody just walked right in&rdquo; seven months after one of the deadliest school shootings in history, KSAT also said of the meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a state-mandated security audit, an inspector posing as an intruder attempted to gain access to three different schools in the grief-stricken area &mdash; strolling into one unchallenged, the meeting heard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interim district Superintendent Gary Patterson admitted the error, saying the ongoing security lapse &ldquo;is really 100 percent my responsibility,&rdquo; telling the meeting: &ldquo;We have got to secure those areas.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlinda Arreola, the grandmother of Uvalde victim Amerie Jo Garza, shared a picture of a school safety officer sitting and looking at his phone.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kari Lake Trial Reveals 42.5% of Randomly Examined Ballots Were Improper</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Republican governor candidate Kari Lake&rsquo;s legal team, 42.5% of examined ballots in Maricopa County for the 2022 governor&rsquo;s race were illegitimate. Lake&rsquo;s trial began on Wednesday were she is attempting to prove that wide scale fraud took place in Maricopa County on election day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lake War Room tweeted on Wednesday that 48 of the 113 ballots that were reviewed during examination were &ldquo;19-inch ballots produced on 20-inch paper,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate tweet, the Lake War Room wrote, &ldquo;This Is how they disenfranchised Maricopa County voters on Election Day. The ballots were designed to be unable to be read through the machines. This wasn&rsquo;t an error. It was malice. The process worked exactly as they intended it to.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One commenter on Twitter noted that there was no way the improper ballot size could have been because of &ldquo;error.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The expert testified there are only 2 ways for the 19 inch image to have bee projected onto the 20 in ballot which would cause tabulator errors. Both methods require an administrator to change. This could not have happened by chance or error. It was fraud.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race between Hobbs and Lake was decided by less than 18,000 votes. The counts put forward by Lake&rsquo;s team contest her loss. Most counts were thrown out by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson, with 8 being tossed while two counts were allowed to proceed. Those counts deal with alleged intentional misconduct.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake told Turning Point USA&rsquo;s AmericaFest on Tuesday that this marked a &ldquo;huge win&rdquo; for her legal team, saying, &ldquo;we got great news. We&rsquo;re taking these b*stards to trial!&rdquo; Adding that Hobbs would take the stand in the trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was later announced by Lake&rsquo;s attorneys that they had withdrawn the subpoena for Hobbs to testify.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb bans the listing of former slave plantations and slave houses</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb has outlawed the listing of rental properties on its site where slaves have lived or worked, according to an update to their anti-discrimination policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moves come after a TikTok video from July calling out the company for listing an "1830s slave cabin" went viral.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The online short-term rental marketplace immediately removed the listing, then sought out others like it, enlisting the help of historical experts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb's "Work to fight Discrimination and Build Inclusion" now includes a section called "Prohibiting the Glorification and Marketing of Slavery," which states that in July 2022, the company "took a series of steps to address the listing of properties in the US that were known to include former slave houses," as they "have no place on Airbnb."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three main policies, which only apply to the United States, prohibit "prohibiting the listing of any home or other structure on a former plantation where enslaved people lived or worked if structures that existed during the time of slavery are still present on the property," bar "any structure specifically designed only to house enslaved people and that did house enslaved people," and prohibit "the promotion of slavery-related features as a selling point of a stay."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exceptions will be made for certain Experiences that "provide important educational context" led by "reputable partners and experts."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Currently we have removed listings and experiences associated with roughly 30 properties that are violating our policies," an Airbnb spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris blames Republicans for border crisis: 'Unwillingness to engage in any meaningful reform'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice President Kamala Harris blamed Republicans for the border crisis during an interview with NPR on Monday and said they were unwilling to engage on the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"And sadly, what we have seen in particular, I am sad to say, from Republicans in Congress is an unwillingness to engage in any meaningful reform that could actually fix a lot of what we are witnessing," Harris told NPR.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, who was tapped by President Biden to address the root causes of the border crisis and effectively became the "border czar" in 2021, told NPR that the White House plans to increase technology and provide more agents to help at the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris told NBC's "Meet the Press" in September that the border is secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular, over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed," she told NBC's Chuck Todd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court temporarily blocked an order that would lift Title 42's restrictions that allowed border officials to deter migrants throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The order was set to expire on Wednesday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nineteen states asked the court to keep Title 42 in place as immigration is expected to surge when the measure expires.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said she was unable to lay out what Harris' work on the border crisis looks like during a press briefing on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/madelineleesman/2022/12/20/el-paso-20k-migrants-n2617350"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/madelineleesman/2022/12/20/el-paso-20k-migrants-n2617350</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">20,000 Migrants Were Waiting Near El Paso for Title 42&rsquo;s Expiration</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, 20,000 migrants were reportedly waiting for Title 42 to end so they could cross the border into the United States, El&nbsp; Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser said this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title 42 was scheduled to expire on Wednesday, Dec. 21. The order had been in place since 2020 that allowed Border Patrol to expel migrants at the southern border due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Post, Leeser said on Monday that the shelters on the other side of the border were &ldquo;completely full&rdquo; as migrants awaited for Title 42&rsquo;s removal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reportedly, Border Patrol has used Title 42 to turn away thousands of migrants trying to enter through the U.S.-Mexico border since its implementation under President Trump in 2020</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/stanford-adds-american-to-harmful-language-list?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/stanford-adds-american-to-harmful-language-list?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford proposes adding 'American' to 'harmful language' list</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Stanford University developed the "Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative" to replace certain words and phrases on its website with approved alternatives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of soon-to-be banned terms includes the label "American," which Stanford argues is too US-centric and ignorant of the other forty-one countries that also exist in the region. The university suggests "US citizen" as an alternative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford grouped their list of words and phrases into eight categories, "Ableist, Ageism, Culturally Appropriative, Gender-based, Imprecise Language, Institutionalized Racism, Person-First, and Violent."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list, which was recently password protected following backlash, was widely shared and criticized on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author and ardent feminist Christina Hoff Sommers blasted the university over the terms included in the "Gender-Based" category.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Don't use 'preferred pronouns'," she tweeted, citing the list, "because 'that suggests non-binary gender identity is a choice'."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also included on that portion of the list is the phrase "balls to the wall," which Stanford argues "attributes personality traits to anatomy."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one user pointed out, however, the "balls" in this case are not testicles, making the university's suggestion laughable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phrase is widely acknowledged to have originated among fighter pilots, who when making their planes go faster would have to push the throttle levers, which were topped with balls, to the wall of the dashboard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms under other categories include "handicap parking," "addict," and "Karen," which Stanford suggests should be replaced with "accessible parking," "person with a substance abuse disorder," and "demanding or entitled White woman," res</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s the iron law of academic writing," the Wall Street Journal quipped. "Why use one word when four will do?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Stanford, the list was compiled over an 18-month period in "collaboration with stakeholder groups," and is encouraged to be utilized by all students and staff.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Approves $10 Million Settlement for Health Care Workers Fired Over COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A U.S. judge approved a multimillion-dollar settlement on Dec. 19 for workers who were fired by an Illinois health care system for refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 500 workers who were terminated or, after seeing their exemption requests denied, got a COVID-19 vaccine, will receive compensation as part of the $10.3 million settlement, a preliminary version of which was first announced in July.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge John Kness, a Trump appointee overseeing the lawsuit brought by the workers, issued verbal approval for the settlement during a hearing, lawyers for Liberty Counsel and NorthShore University Healthsystem said. Kness plans to release a written judgment in the next week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a brief statement emailed to The Epoch Times after Kness&rsquo;s approval, NorthShore wrote, &ldquo;We are pleased with the Court&rsquo;s approval of a supportive resolution to this matter and continue to prioritize the health and safety of our patients and team members.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Mihet, vice president of legal affairs for Liberty Counsel, said in a statement that the group was &ldquo;pleased to finally get the court&rsquo;s final approval of this classwide settlement for these health care workers who were unlawfully discriminated against and denied religious exemptions from the COVID shot mandate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This case should set a precedent for other employers who have violated the law by denying religious exemptions for their employees,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty Counsel, a legal group that brings cases of alleged religious discrimination, was representing the 13 named plaintiffs in the case. The group successfully won class certification for all workers who were denied religious exemptions, a group that was initially believed to be 499 former and current workers but swelled after the preliminary settlement agreement to at least 519.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Dec. 12, 493 class members had submitted claims for a piece of the settlement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each worker who was fired stands to receive $24,225. Each worker who remained at the company stands to receive $3,725.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The named plaintiffs are in line to receive an extra $20,000. Those payments, described as service awards, will provide compensation for the plaintiffs helping advise on court filings, gathering documents, and serving as lead plaintiffs &ldquo;in a sensitive case involving personal health choices and religious beliefs over a matter of intense public debate, even when it was uncertain whether they would have to disclose their identities to the public,&rdquo; according to a recent filing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three workers objected to the settlement, but both parties urged the judge to disregard the objections, which were largely based on pay the trio felt they were owed after being fired.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marzena Novak, one of the objectors, said her actual losses from being fired and losing pay approached $140,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many health care systems, NorthShore imposed a vaccine mandate on employees in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NorthShore told workers that they could file a request for a religious exemption using a form that said the worker in question needed to provide &ldquo;a description of my sincerely held religious principle or practice that guides my objection to receiving the required vaccination.&rdquo; Northshore explicitly instructed applicants to not fill out lengthy answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NorthShore initially approved some of the exemption requests but then reversed the decisions and denied &ldquo;all or virtually all of them,&rdquo; according to filings from the plaintiffs. Officials said the employees failed to meet the standard for religious exemptions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees who wanted a second look were told to file an appeal that included their vaccination history since they were 18. NorthShore then said that any religious objections based on &ldquo;aborted fetal cell lines, stem cells, tissue, or derivative materials&rdquo; would result in denials because those products were &ldquo;not in NorthShore administered vaccines.&rdquo; All of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States have links to aborted fetal cell lines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs said the treatment violated the Civil Rights Act, which requires employers to treat workers similarly, and the Illinois Health Care Right of Conscience Act, which forbids discrimination on the basis of &ldquo;right of conscience.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NorthShore repeatedly denied that it violated the law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system also stated that it was &ldquo;an undue hardship&rdquo; to let unvaccinated staff work at NorthShore and that &ldquo;it initially denied many exemption requests and that on appeal it reconsidered some decisions and chose not to challenge that the requests were made based on sincerely held religious beliefs.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Christianity is no longer relevant to civil law and government. Many Christians want it to be or become relevant again. Today David uses Abraham Kuyper to explain why Christianity has made itself irrelevant. Without that understanding, we will have no clue why it will remain irrelevant despite all our Christian political action.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-sues-arizona-gov-doug-ducey-over-shipping-container-border-wall"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-sues-arizona-gov-doug-ducey-over-shipping-container-border-wall</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Admin Sues Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey Over Shipping Container Border Wall</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department (DOJ) is suing Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and his administration over the use of shipping containers to build a wall along the state&rsquo;s southern border with Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on Wednesday, claiming that the project trespasses on federal property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Arizona has unlawfully and without authority failed to remove the shipping containers from lands owned by the United States or over which the United States holds easements, thereby damaging the United States,&rdquo; the lawsuit argues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal move comes after Ducey issued an executive order in August directing the state&rsquo;s Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to begin a Yuma County project. The 3,820 feet of the previously open border was closed with 130 shipping containers in just 11 days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project then expanded to other parts of the border, with 6,680 feet of containers stacked two-high throughout Cochise County by early November. That section is estimated to take more than 2,700 shipping containers to fill the 10-mile gap along the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, the state filed its own lawsuit to affirm its right to continue using the shipping containers to help curb unlawful crossings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our border communities are overwhelmed by illegal activity as a result of the Biden administration&rsquo;s failure to secure the southern border,&rdquo; Ducey said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Arizona is taking action to protest on behalf of our citizens. With this lawsuit, we&rsquo;re pushing back against efforts by federal bureaucrats to reverse the progress we&rsquo;ve made. The safety and security of Arizona and its citizens must not be ignored. Arizona is going to do the job that Joe Biden refuses to do &mdash; secure the border in any way we can. We&rsquo;re not backing down,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit came after Ducey refused to comply with a demand by the Biden administration to remove containers in the Yuma County area. Arizona officials told the Biden administration that the state would not remove the containers until a permanent barrier is constructed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has warned that Ducey&rsquo;s containers have interfered with land near both the Morelos Dam and land belonging to the Cocopah Indian Tribe&rsquo;s West Reservation. It has also argued the barriers interfere with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection&rsquo;s future project to fill holes in the existing wall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, environmental activists have recently targeted Ducey&rsquo;s shipping container project. The Washington Post reported efforts by climate activists to halt the container border wall, including using their bodies to stand in the way of machinery and sitting on containers in protest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ducey leaves office in January, with Democratic Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs set to take over. She is expected to stop any further container wall work along the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/sam-brinton-biden-nonbinary-official-hide-student-sex-changes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/sam-brinton-biden-nonbinary-official-hide-student-sex-changes</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonbinary ex-Biden official Sam Brinton helped craft policy to hide student sex changes from parents</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Brinton, the nonbinary ex- Energy Department nuclear waste official facing major prison time, once helped a nonprofit group craft a model school policy adopted in several states that tells schools to hide alleged gender identity or sexual orientation changes from "unaffirming" parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2017 and 2020, Brinton was head of advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, an LGBT group focused on youth suicide prevention, according to Brinton's LinkedIn. In 2019, Brinton played a role in developing a 37-page booklet titled "Model School District Policy on Suicide Prevention," which puts restrictions on how much teachers can talk to parents or guardians if their LGBT child is suicidal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While parents and guardians need to be informed and actively involved in decisions regarding the student&rsquo;s welfare, the school mental health professional should ensure that the parents&rsquo; actions are in the best interest of the student (e.g., when a student is LGBTQ and living in an unaffirming household)," read the model, which was also published by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the American School Counselor Association, and the National Association of School Psychologists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brinton, 35, was appointed in January as deputy assistant secretary for spent fuel and waste disposition at the Energy Department's Office of Nuclear Energy. The former official was charged with allegedly stealing a suitcase in September worth an estimated $2,325 and, in July, another suitcase in Las Vegas valued at $3,670, according to the DOJ .</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brinton, a biological male who identifies as nonbinary and was the first purported nonbinary person to work as a top Energy Department official, faces up to 15 years in prison. The former official oversaw a $45 million budget and 100 federal government staff members in his short time at the Energy Department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State education departments in Arizona , Idaho, and Virginia have adopted the Trevor Project's model policy in full or partially. In addition, so have school districts in places such as Oregon, California, and New Hampshire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one section of the model, which is titled "Special Considerations," schools are instructed to conceal a child's sexual orientation or alleged gender identity from their parent or guardian unless the student gives consent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When a parent is notified of perceived suicide risk or an attempt, it is essential that the school maintain student confidentiality related to personal information such as sexual orientation or gender identity, especially when the student has not already disclosed to the parent or guardian and does not want it shared," read the model. "Information shared should be restricted to the perceived risk of suicide or facts of the attempt."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrat Rep. Porter says calling person a 'pedophile' brands them a criminal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrat Rep. Katie Porter says calling a person a "pedophile" or "groomer" is alleging that they are a criminal because of their "identity."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This allegation of groomer and pedophile, it is alleging that a person is criminal somehow, and engaged in criminal acts merely because of their identity, their sexual orientation and their gender identity," Porter said at Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday titled, "The Rise of Anti-LGBTQI+ Extremism and Violence in the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter also said the "groomer narrative is an age-old lie to position LGBTQ+ people as a threat to kids."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson said at the hearing: "When we use words and phrases like groomers and pedophiles to describe people ... it is dangerous and it's got one purpose. It is to dehumanize us and make it feel like we are not a part of this American society."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter's comments were criticized after the hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/universal-basic-income-hits-the-bay-area-if-youre-black/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/universal-basic-income-hits-the-bay-area-if-youre-black/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Basic Income Hits the Bay Area&mdash;If You&rsquo;re Black</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least three guaranteed income initiatives in the San Francisco Bay Area openly discriminate against white residents, limiting or entirely preventing their participation in programs that dole out no-strings-attached cash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programs&mdash;all of which are publicly funded&mdash;violate both the United States and the California state constitution, lawyers say, as well as civil rights laws that ban race discrimination in contracting and by the recipients of government funds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiatives include the Black Economic Equity Movement, which provides $500 a month exclusively to "Black young adults," the Abundant Birth Project, which provides $1,000 a month to "Black and Pacific Islander mothers," and the Guaranteed Income for Transgender People program, which will dole out $1,200 a month and "prioritize enrollment" of transgender "Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC)."&nbsp; They are financed by the National Institutes of Health, the California Department of Social Services, and the city of San Francisco, respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These programs offer a preview of what could soon be the norm in the Golden State. In July 2021, California lawmakers set aside $35 million dollars in grant funding for guaranteed income pilots across the state. Though the law did not include any racial or ethnic qualifiers, in keeping with the California constitution, the state&rsquo;s social services department said that it would only give out the grants to pilots that "center equity." Grant applicants were encouraged to "embed an equity-focused approach throughout each dimension" of their programs, including their "eligibility."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three initiatives appear to violate the 14th Amendment, which bans states from discriminating based on race, said Dan Morenoff, the executive director of the American Civil Rights Project, as well as the California constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which ban racial discrimination in contracting. In addition, the Black Economic Equity Movement appears to violate Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans racial discrimination by the recipients of federal funds. The National Institutes of Health, whose "health equity" initiative funded the program, did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blueprint for these programs comes from private philanthropic ventures, which have experimented with supplemental income schemes in Jackson, Miss., and Atlanta that are only available to black women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though both the Mississippi program, underwritten by the W.K. Kellogg foundation, and the Atlanta program, funded by the Georgia Resilience and Opportunity Fund, discriminate based on race, they probably don&rsquo;t violate any laws, said David Bernstein, a professor of constitutional law at George Mason Law School.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But their California counterparts are another ball game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The publicly funded programs are clearly unconstitutional," Bernstein said. "It&rsquo;s not a close call."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an implicit admission of the legal stakes, every agency involved in the Abundant Birth Project denied using the racial criteria listed on the program&rsquo;s website. The San Francisco Department of Public Health, which oversees the program, told the Washington Free Beacon that it is "open to all San Franciscans," albeit "with focused efforts" to reach black and Pacific Islander "pregnant and parenting people." Jason Montiel, a spokesman for the California Department of Social Services, which in November wrote a $5 million grant to the Abundant Birth Project so it could expand to other parts of the state, said the expansion "will not use race as a basis for eligibility."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That might come as news to Grant Colfax, the director of the San Francisco health department: In a December 6 press release trumpeting the grant, he said it would "help hundreds more Black birthing parents in California." San Francisco mayor London Breed likewise implied that the expansion was racially targeted, calling the Abundant Birth Project "a model to address racial birth disparities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Economic Equity Movement and the Guaranteed Income for Transgender People program did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech Soccer Player Who Was Benched For Refusing To Kneel During National Anthem Sees Lawsuit Move Forward</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Virginia Tech Hokies soccer player Kiersten Hening now has her opportunity to sue the university after she was allegedly benched for refusing to take a knee as other woke athletes were during the playing of the National Anthem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Thomas T. Cullen gave the approval for the lawsuit to go forward since Hening claimed that her freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment was violated after her coach, Charles Adair, allegedly benched Hening since she refused to join in the team&rsquo;s &ldquo;unity statement&rdquo; of kneeling during the National Anthem during a game in 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hening filed a lawsuit against Virginia Tech and Coach Adair in 2021 but Virginia Tech immediately attempted to file a motion to have the suit tossed. The athlete stated that when she refused to take part in the kneeling, which at the time was a virtue signal statement indicating public support for the Black Lives Matter movement, Adair began to insult and demean her as well as limiting her time to play during matches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge also stated that the facts in this particular case firmly show that the coach singled out Hening specifically because of her political views, not because of her ability as an athlete.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then declared, &ldquo;For these reasons, the court will deny Adair&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, and this matter will proceed to trial.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/fed-rate-decision-december-2022.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/fed-rate-decision-december-2022.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed raises interest rates half a point to highest level in 15 years</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 15 years, indicating the fight against inflation is not over despite some promising signs lately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping with expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to boost the overnight borrowing rate half a percentage point, taking it to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5%. The increase broke a string of four straight three-quarter point hikes, the most aggressive policy moves since the early 1980s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the increase came an indication that officials expect to keep rates higher through next year, with no reductions until 2024. The expected &ldquo;terminal rate,&rdquo; or point where officials expect to end the rate hikes, was put at 5.1%, according to the FOMC&rsquo;s &ldquo;dot plot&rdquo; of individual members&rsquo; expectations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors initially reacted negatively to the expectation that rates may stay higher for longer, and stocks gave up earlier gains. During a news conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said it was important to keep up the fight against inflation so that the expectation of higher prices does not become entrenched.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases,&rdquo; the chair said at his post-meeting news conference. &ldquo;But it will take substantially more evidence to have confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward&rdquo; path.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new level marks the highest the fed funds rate has been since December 2007, just ahead of the global financial crisis and as the Fed was loosening policy aggressively to combat what would turn into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time around, the Fed is raising rates into what is expected to be a moribund economy in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members penciled in increases for the funds rate until it hits a median level of 5.1% next year, equivalent to a target range of 5%-5.25. At that point, officials are likely to pause to allow the impact of monetary policy tightening to make its way through the economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consensus then pointed to a full percentage point worth of rate cuts in 2024, taking the funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. That is followed by another percentage point of cuts in 2025 to a rate of 3.1%, before the benchmark settles into a longer-run neutral level of 2.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was a fairly wide dispersion in the outlook for future years, indicating that members are uncertain about what is ahead for an economy dealing with the worst inflation it has seen since the early 1980s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newest dot plot featured multiple members seeing rates heading considerably higher than the median point for 2023 and 2024. For 2023, seven of the 19 committee members &ndash; voters and nonvoters included &ndash; saw rates rising above 5.25%. Similarly, there were seven members who saw rates higher than the median 4.1% in 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FOMC policy statement, approved unanimously, was virtually unchanged from November&rsquo;s meeting. Some observers had expected the Fed to alter language that it sees &ldquo;ongoing increases&rdquo; ahead to something less committal, but that phrase remained in the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed officials believe raising rates helps take money out the economy, reducing demand and ultimately pulling prices lower after inflation spiked to its highest level in more than 40 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After spending much of 2021 dismissing the price increases as &ldquo;transitory,&rdquo; the Fed started raising interest rates in March of this year, first tentatively and then more aggressively, with the previous four increases in 0.75 percentage point increments. Prior to this year, the Fed had not raised rates more than a quarter point at a time in 22 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed also has been engaged in &ldquo;quantitative tightening,&rdquo; a process in which it is allowing proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off its balance sheet each month rather than reinvesting them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A capped total of $95 billion is being allowed to run off each month, resulting in a $332 billion decline in the balance sheet since early June. The balance sheet now stands at $8.63 trillion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/david-depape-in-court-today-live-updates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/david-depape-in-court-today-live-updates/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David DePape case to move forward to trial, judge rules</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David DePape&rsquo;s case will move forward to trial and the alleged Paul Pelosi attacker will be tried on all charges, a San Francisco Superior Court judge ruled on Wednesday. DePape, who appeared in court wearing an orange jumpsuit Wednesday, was arrested on Oct. 28 after allegedly attacking Speaker Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s husband with a hammer inside their Pacific Heights home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superior Court Judge Stephen Murphy just ruled that the San Francisco District Attorney&rsquo;s Office has enough evidence against David DePape to move the case forward to trial on all charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape&rsquo;s defense attorney never disputed that his client was in fact the person who broke into the Pelosi&rsquo;s home and beat Paul Pelosi with a hammer. DePape made a full confession to police during interrogations and video of the interrogation was played in court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most serious charge is premeditated attempted murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defense attorney Adam Lipson tried to argue that the attack was not premeditated, nor attempted murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defense pointed to DePape&rsquo;s statements to Mr. Pelosi and police, in which he said he was targeting Nancy Pelosi, not Paul Pelosi, and intended to break Nancy&rsquo;s kneecaps &ndash; not kill her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Judge Murphy disagreed with the defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco Police Department Lt. Carla Hurley said when she interrogated David DePape, he revealed that he had other political targets. DePape said he planned to kidnap Hunter Biden, who lives in Malibu, California, so he could talk to Hunter about &ldquo;all the corruption&rdquo; in Washington, Hurley testified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape said he planned to travel to Los Angeles to confront Biden at home. (As the son of President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden is protected by Secret Service agents at his Malibu mansion.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape also said he planned to target California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Hurley testified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape told Hurley that he was on a &ldquo;suicide mission&rdquo; and would do whatever it took to stop Congress&rsquo; &ldquo;corruption and lies.&rdquo; Hurley said, in addition to Newsom and Hunter Biden, DePape also had two more targets:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post announces layoffs in early 2023</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post will be making layoffs early in the coming year, said CEO Fred Ryan on Wednesday morning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to several staffers, Ryan announced at a company town hall that there will be layoffs at the paper early next year, reported Max Tani of Semafor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v20nj6a-washington-post-announces-layoffs-in-early-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v20nj6a-washington-post-announces-layoffs-in-early-2023.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As seen on video footage captured by a member of the town hall audience, the crowd became upset at their boss's announcement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What are you going to do to protect people's jobs? Are they going to be treated like the magazine staffers were?" one employee can be heard asking as Ryan began to make his exit while other personnel also attempted to get answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Post ended their Sunday print magazine and laid off its employees, according to the Washingtonian.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of the downsizing comes as the Post faces backlash for the characterization of journalists Bari Weiss and Matt Taibbi as "conservative."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taibbi, who previously worked for Rolling Stone, and Weiss, who was an editor at The New York Times, have both shared many left-leaning views in the past, however, they both are now under fire from the left for their documentation of the "Twitter Files," the internal documents shared by Twitter owner Elon Musk showing the tech giant taking massive steps to suppress and censor conservatives and politically-inconvenient news, such as the Hunter Biden laptop story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a now-edited article, The Post labeled the two as "conservative journalists" for reporting on the &ldquo;Twitter Files,&rdquo; reports the Daily Caller.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedophile spared prison after judge says web chat with 12-year-old girl &lsquo;motivated by boredom&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A British man who engaged in a number of graphic online chats with a girl he believed to be 12 years old has been spared jail time, the Daily Mail reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge presiding over the case argued that the man was "motivated by boredom rather than sexual interest in children" and that his "shame and remorse seem genuine."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Teale, 43, began his chat innocently enough, but the conversation quickly turned sexual, with the married father eventually performing an act over Skype.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won&rsquo;t read exactly what was said, as it is quite graphic in nature&hellip; but I&rsquo;ll just say it was giving me Chris Hanson with to catch a predator vibes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbeknownst to Teale, he was saying all of these things to an undercover police officer, which ultimately resulted in his arrest in January.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He admitted to attempting to engage in sexual activity in the presence of a child and attempting to engage in sexual communications with a child.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge gave him a 12-month suspended jail sentence, meaning that he doesn't have to physically go to prison so long as certain requirements are met, including 150 hours of community service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the sentencing, his previous good character, job loss, as well as the overall impact on his family life were also noted, although these comments were criticized as being an "insult to injury" by a former head of the national online police child protection unit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formerly the Head of Innovation at British investment firm AJ Bell, Teale resigned from his position in July without informing the company of the criminal charges he was facing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teale's lawyer says that he put a stop to his behavior and sought help.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi State football Coach Mike Leach Dies at 61</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Leach, the gruff, pioneering and unfiltered college football coach who helped revolutionize the passing game with the Air Raid offense, has died following complications from a heart condition, Mississippi State said Tuesday. He was 61.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leach, who was in his third season as head coach at Mississippi State, fell ill Sunday at his home in Starkville, Mississippi. He was treated at a local hospital before being airlifted to University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mike was a giving and attentive husband, father and grandfather. He was able to participate in organ donation at UMMC as a final act of charity,&rdquo; the family said in a statement issued by Mississippi State. &ldquo;We are supported and uplifted by the outpouring of love and prayers from family, friends, Mississippi State University, the hospital staff, and football fans around the world. Thank you for sharing in the joy of our beloved husband and father&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leach fought through a bout with pneumonia late in this season, coughing uncontrollably at times during news conferences, but seemed to be improving, according to those who worked with him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of him falling gravely ill swept through college football the past few days and left many who knew him stunned, hoping and praying for Leach&rsquo;s recovery under grim circumstances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His impact on college football over the last two decades runs deep and will continue for years to come.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leach was known for his pass-happy offenses, wide-ranging interests &mdash; he wrote a book about Native American leader Geronimo, had a passion for pirates, a taught a class about insurgent warfare &mdash; and rambling, off-the-cuff news conferences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leach&rsquo;s teams were consistent winners at programs where success did not come easy. In 21 seasons as a head coach at Texas Tech, Washington State and Mississippi State, Leach went 158-107. And his quarterbacks put up massive passing statistics, running a relatively simple offense called the Air Raid that he did not invent but certainly mastered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interview with Leach was as likely to veer off into politics, wedding planning or hypothetical mascot fights as it was to stick to football. He considered Donald Trump a friend before the billionaire businessman ran for president and then campaigned for him in 2016.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He traveled all over the world and his curiosity knew no bounds. He most appreciated those who stepped outside of their expertise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Leach enjoyed digging into topics other than football, he was excellent at the Xs and Os.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six of the 20 best passing seasons in major college football history were by quarterbacks who played for Leach, including four of the top six.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling plays from a folded piece of paper smaller than an index card, Leach turned passers such as B.J. Symons (448.7 yards per game), Graham Harrell (438.8), Connor Halliday (430.3) and Anthony Gordon (429.2) into record-setters and Heisman Trophy contenders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I covered this one due to Mike Leach&rsquo;s time at WSU, where he spent 8 successful seasons at the helm of my father&rsquo;s alma mater. We shared great memories watching his cougars together. Rest in peace Leach, rest in peace.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As suggested by a Grumbler on Facebook, the Pugsters discuss C.S. Lewis&rsquo;s ideas on the Tao from The Abolition of Man. For Lewis, the Tao is a kind of natural law that is the foundation for human knowledge, ethics, etc. The guys tease out some of the implications of the idea of the Tao in the Abolition of Man as well as pursuing some of their own thoughts on the topic.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>One from the archives. Many people get bent out of shape when they see &lsquo;Xmas&rsquo; or &lsquo;X-Mas.&rsquo; They think it&rsquo;s a way of removing Jesus Christ from Christmas. Every year you see the signs and the bumper stickers saying, "Put Christ back into Christmas" as a response to this substitution of the letter X for the name of Christ. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/lawmakers-unveil-bipartisan-bill-that-aims-to-ban-tiktok-in-the-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/lawmakers-unveil-bipartisan-bill-that-aims-to-ban-tiktok-in-the-us.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers unveil bipartisan bill that aims to ban TikTok in the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new bill from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, if passed, would ban TikTok in the U.S. after years of broad concern across the Trump and Biden administrations about potential Chinese government influence on the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media stocks including Meta and Snap were positive Tuesday when the news broke. Meta shares were up more than 6% and Snap was up more than 3% as of late morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has raised fears in the U.S. that Chinese government officials could gain access to U.S. user data under Chinese law that could compel the company to hand over information. TikTok has insisted U.S. user data is safely stored outside of China, which it says should keep it out of reach of government officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the company&rsquo;s reassurances have done little to turn down the heat on TikTok. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. is in talks with the company about how to resolve some of the data concerns, though a solution has reportedly been delayed. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before Congress recently that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;extremely concerned&rdquo; about the Chinese government&rsquo;s potential influence through TikTok on U.S. users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bill, introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., and Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., would ban &ldquo;all transactions from any social media company in, or under the influence of, China, Russia, and several other foreign countries of concern,&rdquo; according to a press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ANTI-SOCIAL CCP ACT &mdash; which stands for Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party &mdash; explicitly names ByteDance and TikTok as subject to the restrictions in the bill, &ldquo;unless and until the date on which the President certifies to Congress that the company no longer meets any of the conditions described,&rdquo; such as being subject to &ldquo;substantial influence&rdquo; by a country of concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is troubling that rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically-motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States,&rdquo; a TikTok spokesperson said. &ldquo;We will continue to brief members of Congress on the plans that have been developed under the oversight of our country&rsquo;s top national security agencies&mdash;plans that we are well underway in implementing&mdash;to further secure our platform in the United States.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis to investigate Covid vaccine-related injuries</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Tuesday morning roundtable with health regarding Covid-19 mRNA vaccine accountability, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he will be petitioning for a statewide grand jury to investigate "any and all wrongdoing in Florida with respect to Covid-19 vaccines."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1602711034921619461"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1602711034921619461</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking in regards to the information that came about during the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, where people were told to stay inside but George Floyd protestors were allowed to congregate in large groups, DeSantis announced a "panel of experts" who will "counteract nonsense when it&rsquo;s coming out of these institutions" like the CDC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of the CDC!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/cdc-mask-tripledemic/2022/12/12/id/1100143/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/cdc-mask-tripledemic/2022/12/12/id/1100143/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC Urging Return to Masks Amid 'Tripledemic'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention again is urging people to wear masks indoors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for encouraging mask use is what health officials are calling a "tripledemic:" the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC's Dec. 8 report said that 13.7% of Americans live in communities rated "high" for COVID-19 community levels, up from 4.9% the previous week, The Hill reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional 38.1% of Americans are in "medium" areas and 48.2% are in "low" areas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"[We] encourage you to wear a high quality, well-fitting mask to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, most especially for those in the 5% of the population currently living in counties with high COVID-19 community level," Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week during a conference call.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"CDC continues to recommend masking for anyone choosing to travel by plane, train, bus, or other form of public transportation, or for anyone who may be immunocompromised or increased risk of severe disease."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hill reported that several major cities are mulling a return to masking mandates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 10 counties in California fall under the "high" areas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles County health officials are recommending that everyone wear masks indoors. Hospitals in LA saw an average of 1,245 COVID-positive patients every day &mdash; a nearly 20% jump from previous week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When you put on your mask for these few weeks during this surge, it is about the people of LA County. It is about every individual, every visitor, our health care workers, essential workers and other people who serve. In addition to vaccination, it is one of the easiest things everyone can do right now,&rdquo; Barbara Ferrer, Los Angeles County director of public health, wrote in a Dec. 9 press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York, state officials urged schools to return to indoor masking to curb the spread of respiratory illnesses, and a health advisory notice alerted hospitals, local health departments, emergency rooms and labs to prepare for rapidly rising cases of respiratory illness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do they want you to mask up, but they&rsquo;re coming for our guns too!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/states-tighten-second-amendment-rules-as-scotus-lifts-restrictions_4915179.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/states-tighten-second-amendment-rules-as-scotus-lifts-restrictions_4915179.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Tighten Second Amendment Rules as SCOTUS Lifts Restrictions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a list of pro-gun rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court over the past 13 years, Rev. Mark Knutson of Portland, Oregon, who has been advocating against gun access, gives one reason for his support of stricter firearms laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This will save lives,&rdquo; says Knutson, a pastor at Augustana Lutheran Church and chairman of the &ldquo;Lift Every Voice Oregon&mdash;YES on Measure 114&rdquo; campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knutson was the chief petitioner of the campaign in support of Oregon Measure 114, which narrowly passed in the midterm election in November. He described the campaign as &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; and said it was in response to the recent shootings in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a well-funded campaign based on reports filed with the Oregon Secretary of State&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;Lift Every Voice Oregon&rdquo; spent just shy of $2.4 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top three contributors to the campaign were Connie Ballmer of Bellevue, Washington, who contributed $750,000. Ballmer is an Oregon native and married to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Together, they have started several organizations to support charitable and political causes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Education Association, a teacher&rsquo;s union, contributed $500,000, and the 1630 Fund contributed $250,000. The 1630 Fund is described by the website Influencewatch.org as a possible &ldquo;dark money&rdquo; fund that supports progressive causes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the fund, Knutson pointed out that, as a 501c4, it is not required to disclose its donors. He said the fund was set up to help progressive political campaigns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Oregon, Measure 114 requires Oregonians apply for a permit to purchase firearms, along with background checks and certification from the purchaser for passing an approved safety course. The law also requires the state police to compile a firearms database, and prohibits the sale of magazines that can hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, is involved in a Second Amendment battle on the opposite side of the country. He denies that safety is motivating New York state officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about intimidation,&rdquo; King said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His organization sued New York state over its previous requirement that concealed weapons permit applicants show &ldquo;proper cause,&rdquo; or in other words, a legitimate reason for applying for a concealed firearm permit. According to King, the law was to disarm the populace while making exceptions for the wealthy and politically connected. The original case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court decided last June that the proper cause requirement was unconstitutional. The court also held that Second Amendment regulations must align with constitutional text and history. In other words, since the Constitution did not mention &ldquo;proper cause&rdquo; and historically this had not been required, the state could not require it either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost immediately, Gov. Kathy Hochul called the legislature into session to pass the Concealed Carry Improvement Act. The act removed mention of &ldquo;proper cause&rdquo; but expanded all other requirements. An applicant&rsquo;s social media will be scrutinized, and must provide contact information for a list of close family and friends. The CCIA also requires 16 hours of training, including two hours of training on a firing range.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the new law expanded the government&rsquo;s list of &ldquo;sensitive places&rdquo; where it sought to prohibit the carrying of firearms. This includes private property unless the property owner posts a sign granting permission or has given express permission to the permit holder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-Second Amendment groups, including Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, sued the state and a judge found several elements of the new law unconstitutional. However, that judge&rsquo;s ruling is on hold as state officials vow to continue the fight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armored Republic</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mission of Armored Republic is to Honor Christ by equipping Free Men with Tools of Liberty necessary to preserve God-given rights.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand bans cigarettes for all those born after 2009</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiwis born after 2009 will not be able to purchase legal cigarettes, according to a new law by Jacinda Ardern's Labour party that seeks to make the country smoke-free.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law would grandfather tobacco use to those born before January 1 of 2009, reports the Daily Mail. This would mean that 50 years from now, one would have to be 63 or older to buy cigarettes in New Zealand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health authorities are aiming to make the country smoke-free by 2025.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law will also reduce the number of retailers who can sell tobacco by 90 percent, which would leave just 600 stores.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand's associate minister of health said that the legislation seeks to ban cigarettes from use, saying that "There is no good reason to allow a product to be sold that kills half the people that use it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"And I can tell you that we will end this in the future, as we pass this legislation," she continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Zealand health system hopes that billions of dollars will be saved by cutting smoking, as it causes cancer, increases blood pressure, strokes, and causes a variety of other diseases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers voted to pass the legislation 76 to 43.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand's right-wing ACT party, which voted against the bill, said that corner stores would go out of business without cigarettes to sell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics New Zealand has found that 8 percent of New Zealand adults smoked daily, down from 16 percent a decade ago. 8.3 percent of adults vape daily, an increase of 1 percent from six years ago. Indigenous Maori populations smoke more than the average New Zealander, with around one-fifth reporting that they smoke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s the news for today&hellip; but before I end today&rsquo;s newsbrief&hellip; I want to stop and take a moment to talk about someone who is likely very dear to some of you&hellip; Mike Lawyer&hellip; Just before I came to do this newsbrief, I received a church email that announced that Dr. Lawyer, had passed away, and has gone to glory, to be with his wife Eileen, and with our creator, whom with no doubt is saying, well done, my good and faithful servant. Dr. Lawyer was a faithful counselor to many in the Moscow community, but also to many around the world, who would always ask the question, &ldquo;where is God in all this?&rdquo; To me&hellip; Mike was more than just a counselor&hellip; he was a dear friend, and a father figure. He came into my life during a dark time, and God used him as a tool to reshape me in Christ&rsquo;s image. Mike, all I can say is I love you, and my heart aches at your passing. But I am comforted to know that you are in glory with our creator and Eileen.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-worker-productivity-tanked-year-what-gives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-worker-productivity-tanked-year-what-gives</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US worker productivity has tanked this year. What gives?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American workers aren't getting nearly as much done this year as they used to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. labor productivity plunged first quarter in the largest decline since 1947, then dropped by the highest annual amount on record in the second according to the Bureau of Labor Statics. The third quarter data indicates year-over-year output saw three consecutive declines for the first time since 1982.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is going on? One expert says there are several factors contributing to the drop in productivity, and the problem is likely to persist for some time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Bauke, founder and chief career strategist with The Bauke Group, told FOX Business the decline in output from the current workforce was largely inevitable &ndash; COVID just sped it up. In short, she says, "The world of work right now is a mess."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. workforce is stretched thin in this tight labor market &ndash; and people are just plain burnt out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, Bauke noted, the pandemic caused many older, seasoned workers to retire early, and the spots left behind by those "boomers" are being filled by an insufficient number of less-experienced workers from younger generations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do Gen X and Gen Z workers lack some of the institutional knowledge as older workers, Bauke says, but they are also less willing to put in the long hours their boomer managers might expect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the older workers that remain now tend to be less willing to sacrifice their health or family time to take on loads of extra work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the problem, month upon month of persistent talent shortages means workers are being asked to do more than just their own job because employers have been unable to fill many open positions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With recession fears growing, the problem is getting even worse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bauke says the first thing companies do when they are looking at cutting back their workforce is to cancel open positions, and "What message does that send to the people back at work who have been doing two jobs? It says the cavalry is not coming."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She argues companies have been pushing their employees to the point that the workers don't care anymore. But, with fewer positions open and a recession looming, workers are scared to leave their jobs out of fear that they would be the first to be laid off if they took a new position elsewhere.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/household-wealth-down-by-13-5-trillion-in-2022-second-worst-destruction-on-record-11670623787?siteid=bullytweet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/household-wealth-down-by-13-5-trillion-in-2022-second-worst-destruction-on-record-11670623787?siteid=bullytweet</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Household wealth dropped by $13.5 trillion from January to September, second-worst destruction on record</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American households lost about $6.8 trillion in wealth over the first three quarters of 2022 as the stock market shed more than 25% of its value, the Federal Reserve reported Friday in the government&rsquo;s quarterly financial accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nominal net worth fell 4.6% to $143.3 trillion, as the market value of assets fell by $6 trillion and liabilities rose by about $900 billion. Households&rsquo; balance sheets -assets minus liabilities&mdash;were propped up by a 10% increase in home equity, which is the greatest source of wealth for most American families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the loss in real wealth from January through September was about twice as large as the nominal loss &mdash; $13.5 trillion in current dollars&mdash;after accounting for the rapid inflation experienced this year. Inflation makes both debts and liabilities worth less in terms of purchasing power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 8.6% drop in real wealth over three quarters is the second-fastest decline on record (the data series begins in 1959). The only greater drop was following the financial crisis of 2008-09. (The wealth lost during the Great Depression of the 1930s would likely hold the record if we had the data.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after adjusting for inflation, real household wealth was about 10% higher than it was in late 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Household balance sheets&mdash;in the aggregate&mdash;remained in excellent shape despite the losses on Wall Street and the erosion of purchasing power. Wealth as a share of annual disposable (after-tax) personal income slipped slightly to 769%, not far off the record 825% in the first quarter of the year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At $18.8 trillion, liabilities were just 103% of annual disposable incomes, far below the peak of 136% seen in 2008, just as that housing bubble burst. In real terms, liabilities are lower today than they were back then, despite the much larger economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners, in particular, were in good shape financially as September ended, with the equity in their houses rising to a near-record 70.5% of market value from a record low of 46% in 2012. But if home prices continue to fall as they have done in the past several months, homeowners without much exposure to the stock market will begin to feel poorer. What will happen to home prices as mortgage rates rise is a major unknown facing policy makers and homeowners alike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warning signs are also flashing as household debt has awakened, like Rip Van Winkle, after a 10-year nap. Following a decade of no growth in debt in inflation-adjusted terms, real household debt grew at a 4.3% annual rate in the third quarter, the fastest growth since 2007.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disgraced Loudon County school superintendent indicted for cover-up in student rape case inquiry</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documents unsealed on Monday have revealed that a special grand jury in Loudon County, Virginia has indicted former superintendent of schools Scott Ziegler for his role in the handling of student sexual assault cases in the county's schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to LoudonNow, the jury has issued four indictments against two Loudon County Public Schools officials, with the indictments being unsealed on Monday by a county judge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler has been indicted on one count of false publication, one count of prohibited conduct, and one count of penalizing an employee for a court appearance, all of which are misdemeanors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Information Officer Wayde Byard was indicted on one count of felony perjury, which reportedly carries a maximum sentence of up to 12 months in jail and a fine of up to $2,500.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special grand jury, which was assembled in April by the Office of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to investigate the handling of two sexual assaults carried out by the same student at two separate schools in 2021, released their report last week regarding the investigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler was fired the following day during a closed-door meeting with the Loudon County School Board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their report, the jury stated that "we believe that throughout this ordeal LCPS administrators were looking out for their own interests instead of the best interests of LCPS."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 28, 2021, a girl was sexually assaulted in the women's bathroom at Stone Bridge High School by a male student. This student was temporarily detained in July of 2021, but was released and transferred to another school within the district. Then on October 6, another sexual assault by that same student took place at Broad Run High School.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We believe that throughout this ordeal LCPS administrators were looking out for their own interests instead of the best interests of LCPS. This invariably led to a stunning lack of openness, transparency, and accountability both to the public and the special grand jury. There were several decision points for senior LCPS administrators, up to and including the superintendent, to be transparent and step in and alter the sequence of events leading up to the October 6, 2021 BRHS sexual assault. They failed at every juncture," the report said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Idaho Settles Christian Students&rsquo; Lawsuit</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Christian students and a faculty member have settled a lawsuit against the University of Idaho that acted to limit their freedom of religious speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit, filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) attorneys in April, blamed university officials for targeting the students&rsquo; First Amendment rights by punishing them for their religious speech. The university had issued no-contact orders on students&mdash;Peter Perlot, Mark Miller, and Ryan Alexander, who are members of the university&rsquo;s Christian Legal Society (CLS) chapter&mdash;as well as CLS faculty advisor Professor Richard Seamon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the settlement, the university rescinded the no-contact orders and agreed to pay $90,000. Following the settlement, CLS attorney Laura Nammo criticized university officials for censoring differing viewpoints as it &ldquo;needlessly exacerbates polarization and harms all students&rsquo; ability to learn from one another,&rdquo; according to ADF Media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s university students will be tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders, judges, and school administrators, so it&rsquo;s imperative that university officials model the First Amendment freedoms they are supposed to be teaching their students,&rdquo; said ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conflict which triggered the lawsuit occurred during spring. The University&rsquo;s College of Law held a public event on the campus in Moscow, Idaho, to condemn an anti-LGBTQ slur that was found on a whiteboard at the Boise campus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event was attended by members of the CLS who also prayed publicly. The members follow a code that classified non-heterosexual marriage as immoral. One university student, referred to as Ms. Doe in court documents, questioned the presence of CLS at the event, pointing to the group&rsquo;s stance on LGBTQ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorneys representing CLS students claim that they had responded respectfully, presenting their beliefs as per their Biblical interpretation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But lawyers representing the university claimed that a CLS member would keep on insisting LGBTQ students will go to the &ldquo;gallows of hell&rdquo; if they fail to &ldquo;repent for their sins,&rdquo; according to AP. Seamon is accused of having reinforced such statements. This caused Ms. Doe to be in tears, the university says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Doe is then said to have received a note from another CLS member on her desk, asking for a discussion on the matter so that both sides can understand each other&rsquo;s views.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She later complained to officials that the contact made her feel harassed and uncomfortable, asking that no-contact orders against everyone, including herself, be issued so that she can feel safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a panel with the American Bar Association, several people publicly denounced CLS&rsquo; religious beliefs. One of the CLS students who attended the meeting claimed that it was his organization and its beliefs that faced the greatest amount of discrimination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When no-contact orders were issued against CLS students, they were given no opportunity to defend themselves or review the allegations leveled against them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CLS members eventually sued the University. In July, a federal judge asked the university to rescind the orders, pointing out that Ms. Doe has not alleged any sexual harassment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge also noted that CLS students would likely succeed in arguing that the university was suppressing their First Amendment rights.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Passes Bill Codifying Federal Right to Same Sex Marriage</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation on Dec. 8 that would codify same-sex and interracial marriage as a federally recognized right.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Respect for Marriage Act, or H.R. 8404, passed on a bipartisan 258&ndash;169 vote. Thirty-nine Republicans joined all Democrats in the lower chamber to pass the bill. One Republican voted present, and four didn&rsquo;t vote. The legislation now heads to the White House for President Joe Biden&rsquo;s signature into law; he has said he&rsquo;ll sign it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House had approved the measure in July but was voting again because the Senate amended the proposal in November.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill includes a codification of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2014 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which declared a federal right to same-sex marriage on grounds of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s &ldquo;equal protection&rdquo; clause.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I began my career fighting for LGBTQ communities&mdash;and now, one of the final bills that I will sign as Speaker will ensure the federal government never again stands in the way of marrying the person you love,&rdquo; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a recent statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics of the bill have warned of the potential for it to target faith-based organizations and have refuted the notion that it&rsquo;s merely a codification of Obergefell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The truth is the Respect for Marriage Act does nothing to change the status of same-sex marriage or the benefits afforded to same-sex couples following Obergefell,&rdquo; the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom wrote in a blog post. &ldquo;It does much, however, to endanger religious freedom.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alliance Defending Freedom described the bill as &ldquo;a direct attack on the religious freedom of millions of Americans with sincerely held beliefs about marriage.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said that by recognizing same-sex marriage in law, the bill &ldquo;embeds a false definition of marriage in the American legal fabric.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, &ldquo;it opens the door to federal recognition of polygamous relationships&rdquo; and &ldquo;jeopardizes the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that exercise their belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican proponents of the bill rejected the claim, saying that it ensured that same-sex marriages would be protected while respecting the rights of faith-based institutions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate passed the final package of the Respect for Marriage Act on Nov. 28.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of a key vote to advance the package, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who often defects from his party on legislation, tied his support for the bill to protections of the religious freedoms of faith-based institutions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If it includes important protections for religions and religious institutions, I will support it,&rdquo; Romney told Politico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Republicans, including Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) demurred from telling reporters how they&rsquo;d vote on advancing the bill ahead of the vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the bill garnered enough support to pass the upper chamber easily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve Republicans joined Democrats to support the bill, including Romney, Ernst, and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio).</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-prisoner-exchange-britney-griner-leaves-behind-marine-veteran-paul-whelan-again"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-prisoner-exchange-britney-griner-leaves-behind-marine-veteran-paul-whelan-again</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden prisoner exchange for Brittney Griner leaves behind Marine veteran Paul Whelan &mdash; again</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden's prisoner exchange with Russia secured the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner on Thursday, but left U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan in Russian custody.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whelan has been in Russian custody since 2018 when he was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges. Griner had been in Russian custody since February after authorities discovered vape cartridges containing a small amount of cannabis oil in her luggage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's administration had initially sought the release of both Griner and Whelan in exchange for notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, a Russian citizen serving a prison sentence in America. Known colloquially as the "Merchant of Death," he was convicted in 2011 of conspiracy to kill Americans and sentenced to 15 years in prison.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration ultimately agreed to exchange Bout for Griner alone, leaving Whelan behind in Russia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Whelan's brother, David Whelan, congratulated Griner on her release in a Thursday statement, but lamented the Biden administration's failure to release his brother.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David's statement went on to note that the Biden administration notified the Whelan family that Paul would be left behind in the exchange. The statement noted that it was the second time the Biden administration had left Paul behind in a prisoner exchange, with the last instance coming in April.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pushed the Biden administration to be more aggressive in its efforts to get Americans released, going so far as to say the U.S. should arrest more Russians for exchange.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Army Keeps Booting COVID Vaccine Refusers as Shot Requirement May Be Dropped</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate appears on the verge of being eliminated by Congress after just over a year, yet the Army -- the only remaining service to never slow down separating troops who refuse inoculation -- said Monday it will not pause those separations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Army has kicked out 1,841 active-duty soldiers for refusing inoculation, according to the latest service data released Friday. The Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force have halted or been barred by the courts from continuing separations, particularly for troops requesting religious exemptions, as legal fights play out over Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's August 2021 order that all service members be vaccinated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, lawmakers might strike a deal to nix the vaccine mandate as part of the annual defense authorization bill after Republicans pushed for the repeal and the Marine Corps said vaccine disinformation in parts of the country is hurting recruiting. A vaccine mandate reversal could also set up an unprecedented legal fight with troops seeking compensation for their dismissal or fighting to be brought back into the ranks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The details of the massive defense bill were expected to be released Tuesday, and it was unclear whether the soldiers who were kicked out would be allowed to return to service or be provided compensation by Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday, Politico reported the Democratic chair of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, put the mandate on the table in negotiations over the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which sets funding and policy priorities for the Defense Department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the pandemic began, GOP lawmakers have attempted to stonewall efforts to combat the spread of infections or boost immunities and have used the Pentagon's inoculation mandate as a partisan rallying cry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troops are required only to get the initial vaccination, not a booster shot. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it's unknown how long the vaccinations protect against the worst effects of COVID-19, though they're estimated to remain effective for about a year, and many service members were vaccinated in early 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps are in a holding pattern on removing troops due to court challenges. Some 1,200 Coast Guardsmen are part of a class-action lawsuit due to their religious exemptions being denied.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/fbi-used-secret-powers-to-strip-more-americans-of-their-gun-rights-documents-reveal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/fbi-used-secret-powers-to-strip-more-americans-of-their-gun-rights-documents-reveal</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI used secret powers to strip more Americans of their gun rights, documents reveal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI has secretly stripped eight more people of their rights to own, use, or purchase firearms , according to internal FBI documents obtained by the Washington Examiner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and over a dozen GOP members of Congress in October demanded that the FBI and Justice Department hand over proof that the FBI is no longer waiving people's gun rights with internal forms, which the Daily Caller uncovered in September had been signed by 15 people. Now, the Washington Examiner has obtained eight heavily redacted signed forms &mdash; indicating a more widespread bureau effort than previously known to target the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Americans can't simply sign their constitutional rights away, even to the FBI," Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX), who signed the October letter, told the Washington Examiner. "As Republicans enter a House majority, we must use our investigative power to put a check on federal agencies who have proven to be eager and willing to crack down on Americans' right to keep and bear arms."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the forms, the FBI asked signatories to identify as a "danger" to themselves or others or lacking the &ldquo;mental capacity adequately to contract or manage&rdquo; their lives. The forms were presented by the FBI to people at their homes and in other undisclosed locations beginning in at least 2016 and until December 2019, when the FBI claims it was discontinued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While two of the new eight forms have redacted dates for when they were signed, the other six are dated between March 2018 and April 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signed forms were obtained by Gun Owners of America, a firearms rights group, as part of its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the bureau to compel the disclosure of records. They were then shared with the Washington Examiner.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche of Media Outlets are Firing Staff or Shutting Down Completely</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more media outlets are firing staff or shutting down altogether as the economy under President Joe Biden continues to tank amid a huge public narrative shift.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One left-leaning outlet, The Recount, shut down entirely after receiving a whopping $34,000,000 from investors, which they can&rsquo;t make back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outlet needed help finding a profitable business model.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, AMC network announced it was laying off a fifth of its staff. The layoffs at AMC Networks come at a time when several media companies, including Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, are making deep cuts to their employee base to navigate a potential downturn in the economy, the Daily Mail noted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, BuzzFeed announced it would be axing 12% of its workforce.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Fetched reported the outlet faced a brutal ad-spending pullback amid an ongoing economic downturn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buzzfeed staffers were notified by email Tuesday that they were losing their jobs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Jonah Peretti wrote in a memo to employees:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In order for BuzzFeed to weather an economic downturn that I believe will extend well into 2023, we must adapt, invest in our strategy to serve our audience best, and readjust our cost structure.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC Universal also announced it was laying off staff, with cuts expected mainly in broadcast and cable TV groups. The headcount reduction is set for 2023 to hit budget targets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR announced it was having a near hiring freeze and budget cuts in anticipation of a $20 million shortfall in financial sponsorships this fiscal year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Washington Post ended its Sunday magazine and also eliminated positions. The Post&rsquo;s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, announced the outlet would end in its current form after printing on Dec. 25.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gannett, America&rsquo;s largest newspaper publisher, also announced it would be six percent of its staffers as the company struggles financially.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans trust in media is at record low amid a huge public narrative shift.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gallup reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 34%, Americans&rsquo; trust in the mass media to report the news &ldquo;fully, accurately and fairly&rdquo; is essentially unchanged from last year and just two points higher than the lowest that Gallup has recorded, in 2016 during the presidential campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just 7% of Americans have &ldquo;a great deal&rdquo; of trust and confidence in the media, and 27% have &ldquo;a fair amount.&rdquo; Meanwhile, 28% of U.S. adults say they do not have very much confidence and 38% have none at all in newspapers, TV and radio. Notably, this is the first time that the percentage of Americans with no trust at all in the media is higher than the percentage with a great deal or a fair amount combined.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-pressure-banks-atone-slavery-era-activities-redress-past-wrongs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-pressure-banks-atone-slavery-era-activities-redress-past-wrongs</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats pressure banks to atone for slavery-era activities to 'redress past wrongs&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks should fund community development in Black communities, support the education of the next several generations of Black students and take other steps to atone for the role they played financing and supporting slavery in America, witnesses told a House committee hearing organized by Democrats on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on "The Role of Financial Institutions in the Horrors of Slavery and the Need for Atonement," which could be the final hearing led by Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., before Republicans take control of the House in January.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Darity, a professor of public policy at Duke University, said the slave trade was a major contributor to the growth of the U.S. financial sector, and said slavery is why Black families are so far behind White families when it comes to household net worth. Darity said a 2020 study says the average White household net worth is $840,000 higher than net worth for Black families and said bridging that gap would be expensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The collective amount required to close the disparity for approximately 40 million black American descendants of persons enslaved in the United States will come to at least $14 trillion," he said in his written testimony. "This is a sum that cannot be met reasonably by private donors or other levels of government."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other witnesses offered ideas on how banks can atone for their participation in the slave trade, which Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, contributed to the vast wealth of U.S. financial institutions that was "built on the backs of enslaved people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Sarah Federman, associate professor at the University of San Diego&rsquo;s Kroc School of Peace Studies, said financial institutions today still need to answer for their role in slavery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">education would be a "major contribution," along with supporting economic development in Black communities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dania Francis, assistant professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, said after slavery ended, Black farmers lost farmland that is worth more than $300 billion today. She said financial institutions should fund studies examining the role they played and commit "funding and resources to community development activities in Black communities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lily Roberts, acting vice president of the Inclusive Economy Center for American Progress, said banks should eliminate wage disparities between Black and White workers and create "programs to redress past wrongs."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii activates National Guard as Mauna Loa lava nears major highway, pockets of natural gas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The continuing flow of lava from the eruption roughly nine days ago from Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano has now forced the island state to activate its National Guard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state's emergency management said Monday that 20 Hawaii National Guard service members were put on active duty to assist with traffic control and other roles in response to the Nov. 27 eruption.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Interior Department said lava flow is now just roughly two miles away from a major highway known as Saddle Road.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There continued to be several small overflows from main channels recorded over the past day," the federal agency said Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials previously said the volcano would likely be confined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lava advanced Monday at a rate of about 20 feet per hour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Though the advance rate has slowed over the past several days, the lava flow remains active with a continuous supply," the federal department also said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lava advance rates "may be highly variable" over the next several weeks, according to officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities warned that lava may flow into vegetated areas and create secondary fires or even cause methane explosions by igniting underground natural gas pockets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents are urged to take precautions against volcanic glass fragments, which are being blown hundreds of meters away from the eruption.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AOC under investigation by House Ethics Committee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is under a House Ethics investigation, a statement from the Ethics Committee revealed on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Acting Chairwoman and Acting Ranking Member of the Committee on Ethics have jointly decided to extend the matter regarding Representative Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, which was transmitted to the Committee by the Office of Congressional Ethics on June 23, 2022," the letter states. The acting chairwoman is Democrat Susan Wild (D) and the acting Ranking member is Michael Guest (R).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also states that the "fact of a referral or an extension and the mandatory disclosure of such an extension and the name of the subject of the matter, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement does not reveal why Ocasio Cortez is under investigation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York congresswoman has faced ethics complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics over allegations that she illegally funneled cash through a PAC to her boyfriend, the Washington Examiner reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This Complaint alleges Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez improperly converted U.S. House resources to her non-official, personal use by obtaining an official &lsquo;@mail.house.gov&rsquo; e-mail address for her boyfriend, despite the fact he was not employed by her congressional office,&rdquo; that complaint, from March of 2019, read. &ldquo;Moreover, it appears she obtained the e-mail address for him by falsely designating him a &lsquo;staff&rsquo; member."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AOC was also hit with an ethics complaint after she accepted a free ticket for the Met Gala in September of 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Accountability Foundation's Thomas Jones wrote in an ethics complaint that AOC broke House rules by accepting "an impermissible gift"</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn Youngkin moves to reimburse fines for violating Covid lockdown restrictions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced on Tuesday his plans to pay back the people and businesses who were fined by the state for violating Covid lockdown policies put in place by his predecessor, Democratic former Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an executive order, Youngkin commanded all state enforcement agencies, boards, and commissions, to report the fines and disciplinary actions they imposed upon those individuals and entities. According to an official statement, a reimbursement process is in the works for his upcoming budget proposal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also announced he will direct agencies to cease any further collection and enforcement of any lockdown-related fines, fees, or suspensions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am today requiring a statewide review of Covid-19-related penalties imposed by the Northam administration. The fact that businesses are still dealing with Covid-19 related penalties and fines is infuriating. Livelihoods are on the line," said Youngkin. "In the previous administration, we saw our government shut down businesses, close our schools, and separate us from each other. While we can't undo the damage done during the Northam administration, we are taking action going forward to end COVID-era draconian overreach."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor's office statement added that the fine reimbursements will not apply to instances where the violation was in relation to practices "intended to protect the health and safety of individuals, patients, residents, and staff of hospitals, nursing homes, certified nursing facilities, hospices, or assisted living facilities."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philly gas station hires armed guards to protect against theft</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner of a gas station in North Philadelphia got so fed up with the prevalence of violent crime in the city that he hired heavily armed security guards to protect his customers and store.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are tired of this nonsense," he says. "Robbery, drug trafficking, hanging around, gangs. They are forcing us to hire the security, high-level security, state level."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the theft of his ATM by a group of vandals, as well has the repeated vandalism of his car, Patel finally felt the need to hire security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ABC7 News, crime in Philadelphia has risen quite significantly in the last few years, with firearm robberies at gas stations in particular having tripled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney David Thiruselvam, whose clients are primarily victims of crime, says that he currently has nine people suing gas station after being shot on their premises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Pennsylvania law, owners are responsible for protecting customers from known dangers while on their property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the locals' opinions, the move worked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since hiring the security force three weeks ago, his business has not experienced any incidents of loitering or other crimes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-jack-dorsey-calls-on-elon-musk-to-make-everything-public-now?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-jack-dorsey-calls-on-elon-musk-to-make-everything-public-now?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Dorsey calls on Elon Musk to make 'everything public now'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey expressed to Elon Musk in a tweet on Wednesday that, for the sake of transparency, the Twitter Files be released to the public to "let people judge for themselves."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, documents of what action took place to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story are in the hands of journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss. The first round of files were revealed on Friday, with Taibbi providing a "Supplemental" on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dorsey said in his tweet: "If the goal is transparency to build trust, why not just release everything without filter and let people judge for themselves? Including all discussions around current and future actions? Make everything public now. #TwitterFiles"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several revelations have been made so far, with several chat logs being made public. The names of key players have been revealed, including former Trust and Safety Chief Yoel Roth, the recently fired Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker, and former head of legal, policy, and trust Vijaya Gadde.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taibbi's first thread on the Twitter files states explicitly that the vast amount of censorship was done "without the knowledge of CEO Jack Dorsey," and that situation was difficult to manage after Dorsey became involved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Musk revealed that Twitter has interfered with elections. It was in response to a report from Reuters about Twitter's move to free speech under Musk, he replied that "The obvious reality, as long-time users know, is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections. Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective, transparent and even-handed."</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Wednesday, December 7th, 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I get to the news today, how about a little on this day in history?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 7, 1941, Japanese planes attacked the United States Naval Base at Pearl HarborExternal, Hawaii Territory, killing more than 2,300 Americans. The U.S.S. Arizona was completely destroyed and the U.S.S. Oklahoma capsized. A total of twelve ships sank or were beached in the attack and nine additional vessels were damaged. More than 160 aircraft were destroyed and more than 150 others damaged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hurried dispatch from the ranking United States naval officer in Pearl Harbor, Admiral Husband Edward Kimmel, Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, to all major navy commands and fleet units provided the first official word of the attack at the ill-prepared Pearl Harbor base. It said simply: AIR RAID ON PEARL HARBOR X THIS IS NOT DRILL.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following day, in an address to a joint session of Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt called December 7, 1941 &ldquo;a date which will live in infamy.&rdquo; Congress then declared War on Japan, abandoning the nation&rsquo;s isolationism policy and ushering the United States into World War II. Within days, Japan&rsquo;s allies, Germany and Italy, declared war on the United States, and the country began a rapid transition to a wartime economy by building up armaments in support of military campaigns in the Pacific, North Africa, and Europe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there ya go, a little history for you guys on this Wednesday morning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s start the news off with this:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vladimir-putin-bans-all-lgbt-propaganda-far-reaching-move"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vladimir-putin-bans-all-lgbt-propaganda-far-reaching-move</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vladimir Putin bans all 'LGBT propaganda' in far-reaching move</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation banning all LGBT "propaganda" on Sunday, according to Russian media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The far-reaching bill prohibits the creation or sharing of content depicting nontraditional sexual relations, gender reassignment and pedophilia in a positive lights, according to state-run media. The law reportedly extends to social media platforms, as well as mass media like films and advertisement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law also has a provision pertaining to minors and empowers to country's media watchdog to implement systems preventing minors from viewing such content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law went into effect the same day it was signed, on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putin has long waged a political war against the LGBT movement in Russia, and his allies have in the past cited the movement's success in the U.S. as an excuse for expansive actions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, who authored the bill, cited trends in the U.S. and Europe as a reason to pass it in November.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He cited data from opinion polls, according to which 16% of Europeans aged 14 to 29 identify themselves as LGBT," the Duma reported at the time. "And in the U.S. state of Maryland, the number of students who have not decided on their gender due to the promotion of non-traditional relationships has grown almost six times in two years and today makes up 45% of all students in the state."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Duma did not cite where it received the polls, and it was not immediately clear if the polls are in fact accurate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violations of the new law are mostly punished with fines, ranging from $800 for citizens infringing on the lowest tier to $160,000 for legal entities that infringe on the highest tier, which is pedophilia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now moving on to our stellar economy:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2022/12/06/u-s-trade-deficit-rises-5-4-to-four-month-high/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2022/12/06/u-s-trade-deficit-rises-5-4-to-four-month-high/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Trade Deficit Rises 5.4% to Four-Month High</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nation&rsquo;s trade deficit widened 5.4 percent in October to a four-month high of $78.2 billion, data from the Commerce Department showed Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was lower than expected. Economists had forecast the deficit would rise to around $80 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The October increase in the goods and services deficit reflected an increase in the goods deficit of $6.1 billion to $99.6 billion and an increase in the services surplus of $2.1 billion to $21.4 billion. The U.S. is typically a net exporter of services to the rest of the world and an importer of goods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far this year, the goods and services deficit is up $136.9 billion, or 19.9 percent, from the same period in 2021. Exports increased $415.3 billion or 19.8 percent. Imports increased $552.2 billion or 19.8 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic weakness around the globe, particularly in Europe, has softened demand for U.S. energy imports, including natural gas and petroleum products. Crude oil exports, however, grew by $1.6 billion. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation so the declines also reflected the recent weakening of the dollar against many other currencies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Exports of consumer goods were also lower, led by a decline in pharmaceuticals due to lower demand for drugs to treat or prevent infection of China&rsquo;s coronavirus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. spent more on imported cars and pharmaceuticals. Imports of cell phones, toys, games, and sports equipment slipped lower.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s check in on our southern border:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/06/ice-biden-immigration-border/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/06/ice-biden-immigration-border/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE Is Massively Misreporting How Many Illegal Immigrants Are Being Released With GPS Trackers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is significantly misreporting the number of illegal immigrants released into the country with GPS tracking technology by nearly 600%, according to an internal document exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE disclosed privately to participants of a closed-door event about the agency&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alternatives to Detention&rdquo; Thursday, attended by ICE Director Tae Johnson along with several agency officials and non-profits, that 8,118 illegal immigrants are monitored with GPS tracking through the program as of Nov. 14. Publicly, however, ICE says on its website that 56,805 illegal immigrants are monitored by GPS as of Nov. 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former ICE Chief of Staff Jon Feere, who now serves as director of investigations at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), believes that the Biden administration is seeking to appease groups that have fought ICE detention, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which was listed as an attendee at Thursday&rsquo;s event. The ACLU has a campaign on its website titled &ldquo;SHUT DOWN THE ICE DETENTION MACHINE,&rdquo; which encourages the public to email Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to urge ICE against any new detention contracts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program given to the Thursday event&rsquo;s attendees also showed that ICE underreported illegal immigrants without tracking technology by more than 18,000%, as previously reported by the DCNF. ICE disclosed to the attendees that as of Nov. 14 there are 49,459 illegal aliens that aren&rsquo;t monitored with any tracking equipment, while its own website says that as of Nov. 19 there are 266.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration continues to see record numbers of migrants illegally cross the southern border, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountering over 2.3 million in fiscal year 2022 and more than 230,000 in October.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How about a word from our friends across the pond?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/uk-government-approves-climate-lockdown-trials-for-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/uk-government-approves-climate-lockdown-trials-for-2024/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK Government Approves Climate Lockdown Trials for 2024</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents would be confined to their local neighborhood and would not be able to leave unless they requested permission from the government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the climate lockdown plan, the &rsquo;15 minute cities&rsquo; would place electronic gates on key roads in and out of the city, so the government would be instantly alerted by anyone trying to leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who request permission to leave their city would be profiled by the government, which would make a decision on whether to let that person out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new scheme, residents would be permitted to leave their zone a maximum of 100 days per year, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, every resident must register their car details with the government, enabling them to be tracked via smart cameras around the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Vision News reported:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oxfordshire County Council, which is run by Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party, secretly decided to divide up the city of Oxford into six &rsquo;15 minute&rsquo; districts in 2021 soon after they were elected to office. None of the councilors declared their intention of imprisoning local residents in their manifestos of course, preferring to make vague claims about how they will &lsquo;improve the environment instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every resident will be required to register their car with the County Council, which will then monitor how many times they leave their district via number plate recognition cameras. And don&rsquo;t think you can beat the system if you&rsquo;re a two-car household. Those two cars will be counted as one, meaning you will have to divide up the journeys between yourselves. 2 cars, 50 journeys each; 3 cars, 33 journeys each and so on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new rules, your social life becomes irrelevant. By de facto, Councils dictate how many times per year you can see friends and family. You will be stopped from fraternizing with anyone outside your district, and if you want a long-distance relationship in the future, forget it; you are confined to dating only those within a 15-minute walk of your house.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single person&rsquo;s life will be at the mercy of Communists in the central office, dictating the same draconian rules we had to avert the last crisis, a mild flu virus so deadly 80% of people didn&rsquo;t even know they had it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An entirely new social structure is being imposed on Oxford&rsquo;s residents ( and more cities are to follow) under the lie of saving the planet. but what it really is, is a plan for Command and Control. There will be permits, penalties and even more ubiquitous surveillance. Council officials will determine where you can go and how often, and will log every time you do. 15-minute cities, or 15 minute prisons?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an article on The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s website, &rsquo;15 minute&rsquo; cities are a powerful tool for action:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would Paris&rsquo;s Mayor Anne Hidalgo have pushed for progressive urban design without this framing? Undoubtedly. But with COVID-19 and its variants keeping everyone home (or closer to home than usual), the 15-minute city went from a &ldquo;nice-to-have&rdquo; to a rallying cry. Meeting all of one&rsquo;s needs within a walking, biking, or transit distance was suddenly a matter of life and death. The pandemic created an urgency around equitable urbanism that sidelined arguments about bike lanes and other &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; that have roiled communities for years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such calls for draconian measures to fight climate change are nothing new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020, the Red Cross declared climate change is a more significant threat than COVID, saying it should be confronted with &ldquo;the same urgency.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Bill Gates demanded dramatic measures to stop climate change, arguing it would be worse than the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said that climate deaths would dwarf those of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is the solution? More lockdowns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politicians and government know that fear helps the public to accept dramatic curtailing of freedoms, especially with vague promises of safety. The COVID lockdowns proved this. So now power-hungry bureaucrats can utilize the precedents for more comprehensive lockdowns in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, from California:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/california-english-teacher-says-proper-grammar-is-white-supremacist-refuses-to-teach-it?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/california-english-teacher-says-proper-grammar-is-white-supremacist-refuses-to-teach-it?utm_campaign=64487</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California English teacher says proper grammar is &lsquo;white supremacist,&rsquo; refuses to teach it</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A California high school English teacher claimed that she undermines "white supremacy" in her classroom by educating students about the overemphasis placed on writing rules and grammar usage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Fox News, as a tenured English teacher at Oroville High School, Marta Shaffer began this school year by teaching parts of linguistics as a way of "fighting white supremacy in my classes." She posted on TikTok that her goal was to be "inclusive of all kinds of ways we use the language."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1599466639740706816"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1599466639740706816</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schaffer said in another video obtained by the outlet that a student's "codes" &ndash; how they speak at home or with friends &ndash; is "just as important, if not more than important," than a boss's expectations of how their employee communicate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Just because your teachers, your professors, and your boss may expect you to write and speak in a certain way that may not be natural to you, does not mean that your more natural&hellip; languages are not important. They are just as important, if not more important than the &lsquo;language of respectability.&rsquo;"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schaffer said she feels like a "cringe white lady" when "teaching students of color" about linguistics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey something we can both agree on ms. schaffer!</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Upon a deeper observation, It seems like the Left has no qualms calling upon &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Word&rdquo; as their authority and advancing &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Kingdom&rdquo;. Yes their interpretations are contradictory of the Bible, but they do not seem to back down with their rhetoric&hellip; </span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ccp-linked-hackers-stole-20-million-in-covid-benefits?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ccp-linked-hackers-stole-20-million-in-covid-benefits?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCP-linked hackers stole $20 MILLION in Covid benefits from US</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secret Service announced that hackers linked to the Chinese government stole at least $20 million in U.S. Covid relief funds, primarily those meant to help small businesses and unemployed Americans, NBC reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theft from the Chengdu-based hacking group which goes by the name APT41 is the first instance of pandemic fraud tied to a foreign government that the U.S. has publicly acknowledged, and it may just be the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret service declined to comment on any other potential instances of state-sponsored fraud, but said that there are more than 1,000 ongoing investigations into the stealing of Covid relief funds involving domestic and international cyber criminals, acknowledging that APT41 is "a notable player."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear at this point whether the Chinese government directed APT41 to commit this fraud or simply looked the other way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I've never seen them target government money before," the head of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, John Hultquist said. "That would be an escalation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secret Service considers APT41 to be a "Chinese state-sponsored, cyber threat group that is highly adept at conducting espionage missions and financial crimes for personal gain."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials believe that the primary purpose of state-sponsored groups like this is to gather sensitive information from American individuals, businesses, and institutions that could be used by the Chinese for espionage purposes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point in time, law enforcement officials and counterintelligence experts and almost certain that every American has had all or most of their personal data taken by the Chinese government in one way or another.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor Department Office of Inspector General has estimated that more than $160 billion of the $872.5 billion set aside for Federal pandemic unemployment funds has potentially been siphoned off by cybercriminals, though some individual states estimate higher amounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other estimates that put that number as high as $350 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/european-country-considers-banning-electric-vehicle-travel-amid-energy-crisis-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/european-country-considers-banning-electric-vehicle-travel-amid-energy-crisis-report</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Country Considers Banning Electric Vehicle Travel Amid Energy Crisis: Report</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland is considering banning electric vehicles for non-essential travel this winter as the continent deals with an energy crisis sparked by Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Telegraph reported that government officials have already drafted plans to conserve energy that could include limiting heat in buildings to no more than 68 degrees Fahrenheit and reducing the number of hours stores can be open.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stricter measures could be enacted, including banning large indoor gatherings like sporting events, concerts, and theatre events, the report said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland relies heavily on hydroelectric power, which constitutes nearly two-thirds of its energy supply, the excess of which it exports during the time of year that it can generate the most electricity from rain and snowfall, the report said. It then typically is forced to import energy during the rest of the year as its nuclear resources, which it has been working to phase out, and its fossil fuel resources are not enough to meet demand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country has created a two-tier system for dealing with the energy shortage: emergency and crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in the &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; tier, there are three levels of restrictions, and in the &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; tier, there are two levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicles would face restrictions in the third level of the emergency tier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late August, officials in California unveiled a plan to phase out new gas-powered cars and days later asked residents to avoid charging their electric vehicles in the interest of not overwhelming the power grid during a heat wave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warnings of low grid capacity came days after the California Air Resources Board issued new rules requiring 35% of new vehicles to produce zero emissions by 2026 &mdash; a standard that will rise to a 68% benchmark by 2030 and a 100% level by 2035. Yet experts have warned that the state&rsquo;s electric grid will require significant upgrades to manage a rapid transition away from internal combustion vehicles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Today, most people charge their electric cars when they come home in the evening &mdash; when electricity demand is typically at its peak,&rdquo; according to researchers at Cornell University&rsquo;s College of Engineering. &ldquo;If left unmanaged, the power demanded from many electric vehicles charging simultaneously in the evening will amplify existing peak loads, potentially outstripping the grid&rsquo;s current capacity to meet demand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/canada-offered-assisted-suicide-paralympian-veteran-wanted-wheelchair-lift-installed-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/canada-offered-assisted-suicide-paralympian-veteran-wanted-wheelchair-lift-installed-report</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada offered assisted suicide to a Paralympian veteran who wanted a wheelchair lift installed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada's Veterans Affairs office offered to assist a Paralympian and veteran to commit suicide when she sought to have a wheelchair lift installed in her home, the woman told lawmakers last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine Gauthier, a 52-year-old retired corporal who competed in the 2016 Paralympics at Rio De Janeiro, testified to lawmakers that a VA official had offered &mdash; in writing &mdash; to provide her with a medically-assisted suicide kit. The case officer remains unnamed but reportedly made similar offers to at least three other veterans, according to the Independent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I have a letter saying that if you&rsquo;re so desperate, madam, we can offer you MAID, medical assistance in dying," Gauthier said in a hearing before the House of Commons veterans affairs committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the incident in a public statement on Friday after Gauthier said she personally wrote him a letter on the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are following up with investigations and we are changing protocols to ensure what should seem obvious to all of us: that it is not the place of Veterans Affairs Canada, who are supposed to be there to support those people who stepped up to serve their country, to offer them medical assistance in dying," Trudeau said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada first approved medically-assisted suicide in 2016, and the parameters around allowing it have since loosened. The law originally legalized assisted suicide only for those facing imminent death, but it now also includes those who suffered severe pain or disabilities, according to the Independent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gauthier's story comes just weeks after a Canadian fashion company glorified assisted suicide in a commercial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian fashion company La Maison Simons promoted the "beauty" in voluntary euthanasia in a promotional video titled "All is Beauty." The ad includes a voiceover from Jennyfer Hatch, a 37-year-old Canadian woman who voluntarily euthanized herself after suffering from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simons says that the ad aimed to "help people to reconnect to each other and to this hope and optimism," which he says "is going to be needed if we're going to build the sort of communities and spaces where we want to live and that are enjoyable to live in."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The &lsquo;All is Beauty&rsquo; campaign has come to an end this week. Simons is now entering their annual holiday sprint," a spokesperson for Simons told Fox News Digital. "In this context, all of their teams' efforts are focused on in-store and web holiday activities."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Avenatti sentenced to 168 months</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti has been sentenced to 168 months in prison for four counts of wire fraud.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This 14 year sentence is in addition to the five years he is currently serving for other charges, including stealing almost $300,000 in book-advance money from his then-client Stormy Daniels</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Avenatti plead guilty to four counts of wire fraud and a single count of tax fraud, and admitted to misappropriating funds from clients totaling around $10 million.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his sentencing on Monday, Avenatti appeared solemn, often keeping his head down and hands in front if him while hearing statements from two of his victims, according to Law and Crime News' senior reporter Meghann Cuniff, who was documenting the proceedings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It is now time to pay his debts to the victims, the government and society," the Judge said, right before sentencing him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avenatti became widely known across the country as the lawyer representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in her failed lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, after it was revealed that she was paid $130,000 in hush money before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about an alleged sexual encounter she had with Trump years earlier</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the "creepy porn lawyer" by Tucker Carlson, Avenatti was the darling of the mainstream media for a time, seen as a hero "David" for going after "Goliath" Trump, before Avenatti's fall from grace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of 2021, he was also convicted of extortion after trying to get Nike to pay him $25 million that he claimed he was owed on behalf of a Los Angeles youth basketball team. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison and wept hysterically in response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of the numerous fraud charges against him, he also admitted to blocking IRS efforts to collect unpaid payroll taxes of an estimated $5 million, include payroll taxes that had been withheld from employee paychecks of a Tully's Coffee operated by an Avenatti-owned company.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man thrown over the side of a bridge after Chargers game in wild incident caught on video says his attacker has still not been arrested by police</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man who was caught on video being thrown over the side of a footbridge while exiting a Los Angeles Chargers on November 20th is speaking out, blasting police for not arresting his attacker and saying he no longer feels safe attending games at SoFi Stadium.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, the man, who has been identified as Austin Willenbring, can be seen in a shoving altercation with some unknown individuals, who eventually lift him up and throw him over the side of the bridge railing to a concrete walkway below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, the men can be seen then dragging Willenbring to the railing before throwing him over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willenbring says that he suffered serious injuries as a result of his fall, including a concussion and broken ribs. Even still, he says that he and his sister were able to track down and identify the men who had thrown him over the railing, and even though they were able to make a positive ID to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies, and had video of the entire incident, police refused to make an arrest. WCAL also reports that there is no record that the man identified by Willenbring has yet been arrested by police or charged with any crime in connection with the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inglewood police told WCAL they are "still investigating" the incident, and Inglewood mayor James Butts defended the city's response to the incident, saying, "Here's the reality: When you have hundreds of thousands of people in one place, when you have alcohol involved, you're gonna have fights. It's an unfortunate fact of life. We have to put things in perspective, six million patrons in three years, three altercations."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willenbring says that he plans to cancel his season ticket package because he no longer feels safe going to games.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Continuing in our series about biblical doctrines that, once embraced, massively change the Christian worldview and how Christians interact with the culture around them, P Nate, #1 and Air-Jordan return to Garage-Mahal ready to talk about the divine council and biblical cosmology.</p>
<p>What are we to make of angels, demons, principalities, pagan gods and more importantly, how has God structured the hierarchy of the cosmos? What does the Bible reveal and how does it change how we engage?</p>
<p>Some excellent resources on the topic for your further study:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Spine of Scripture by Domonic Bnonn Tennant</li>
<li>The Forgotten Heavens (multiple authors but edited and compiled by Doug Wilson)</li>
<li>The Unseen Realm by Dr. Michael Heiser</li>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome, Neighbor! We're continuing our rebroadcast of John's first podcast episodes, ever.&nbsp; This is the Comedy Sojourn Episode #2, originally published in September 2016.&nbsp; Please forgive the audio issues. We were rubes back then... (Not like now--because these days we always get our audio equipment to work perfectly.)</p>
<p>Andrew and Tabby are John's two youngest children, and they have a lot to say about a spider they caught.&nbsp; Should they kill it or catch-and-release?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode:</p>
<p>"You could get eight really good drumsticks from that spider." --John Branyan</p>
<p>"We have butts, and we can't spin webs...cigarettes have butts, and they can't spin webs."</p>
<p>Tabby is getting married later this week, but she won't come back to visit if Dad and Andrew let the spider go in the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...Did you know, Dad, that some turtles breathe out of their butts?" --Tabby (Branyan) Farkas</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; John and the Peaches talk about the Atheist Hospice Care Worker.&nbsp; (With just a few interruptions from young girls with noisy toys.)&nbsp; How can an Atheist assign value to end-of-life care?</p>
<p>Quote from The Way of the Heathen: "We matter because we matter to each other in our own short time on our own short scale...we make each other important."</p>
<p>Reach out to John and the Peaches by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>On this week's episode of OPEN MIKE, Mike has the pleasure of sitting down with Pastor Tobias Riemenschneider of the <em>Evangelical-Reformed Baptist Church in Frankfurt</em> (<a href="https://erb-frankfurt.de/leitung-der-kirche/">https://erb-frankfurt.de/leitung-der-kirche/</a>) and author of the&nbsp;<em>Frankfurt Declaration</em>. In it, they talk about the Lordship of Jesus Christ over all of life and how that affects all the various spheres of authority in life and the stunning reality that Germany strictly enforces a Nazi law forbidding homeschooling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Janet Yellen blames Americans' 'splurging' for record-high inflation</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen blamed consumers' excessive spending habits as a primary cause for the near 40-year-high in inflation on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden official appeared on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," where she was asked about the price increases that have plagued the U.S. for more than a year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colbert asked her to explain to his audience how inflation got out of hand when "two years ago everything seemed fine." The late-night host, known for his sycophantic boosting of President Biden and Democrats, even noted the Biden administration dismissed inflation as a "small risk" as recently as last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen argued the administration managed the COVID-19 pandemic so well that consumers felt comfortable to "splurge" on goods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no mention during the remarks about multitrillion-dollar spending bills that have been passed and signed during Biden's administration. She also isn't the only White House official who's blamed inflation on Americans spending recklessly or who has dismissed economic concerns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House chief of staff Ron Klain was mocked for suggesting rising costs and supply chain issues were a "high class" problem last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was also criticized for laughing at rising gas prices and offering Americans tax credits for installing solar panels on their homes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberal journalists like MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle have also argued consumers could afford to spend more money on groceries and utilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4% from September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite prices still being near the 40-year high, Biden told a reporter last month that the economy was "strong as hell."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NY Democrats want taxpayers to shell out $300M to help illegal migrants avoid deportation: &lsquo;We have a moral obligation&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Albany Democrats, originally from New York City, are pushing for a bill to cover the legal fees of illegal immigrants battling deportation, which would cost taxpayers roughly $300 million, the New York Post reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manhattan Senator Brad Hoylman (D) and Queens Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz (D) support the legislation despite estimates that it will require a $55 million down payment in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the legislation are pushing for New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) to support the proposal and commit to $100 million in funding from the state&rsquo;s budget. On Wednesday, the governor committed to providing $3 million to nonprofit organizations assisting immigrants with their asylum applications.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics of the bill expressed concern that the legal defense could help potentially &ldquo;dangerous people&rdquo; remain in the United States and hurt public safety. Those opposed to the measure also cited budget concerns and noted that New York City is already estimated to spend $1 billion on costs related to the influx of migrants arriving in the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would cover legal defense costs for any incarcerated immigrant, regardless of the criminal convictions that initiated their removal proceedings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Assembly Minority Leader William Barclay of Pulaski stated, &ldquo;Democrats&rsquo; complete failure on border security and immigration shouldn&rsquo;t result in a $300 million tax on New Yorkers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Last year, New York City&rsquo;s radical Democrats wanted non-citizens to vote in local elections,&rdquo; Barclay continued. &ldquo;Now they expect the public to spend hundreds of millions to provide free deportation lawyers. Their political statements do not need to be contained in the state spending plan.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/government/congress/gop-senators-withhold-support-defense-funding-until-they-get-vote-end-military"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/government/congress/gop-senators-withhold-support-defense-funding-until-they-get-vote-end-military</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP senators to withhold support for Defense funding until they get vote to end military vax mandate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven GOP senators made the vow Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference, saying they would withhold the support if leaders of the Democrat-led chamber don't allow a floor vote on their proposal, according to NBC News.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said the group will not vote to get on the NDAA "unless we have a vote on ending this military vaccine mandate."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The libertarian-mined Paul typically votes against the act every year and is among the most critical in his conference about the federal government's handling of the pandemic, including mandated vaccinations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senators' effort could delay final passage of the annual bill, which Congress has consistently passed, but it would not prevent the Senate from eventually voting on the legislation, NBC also reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other six are Sens. Mike Braun, of Indiana; Ted Cruz, of Texas; Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin; Mike Lee, of Utah; and Rick Scott, of Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham says military recruitment had suffered as a result of vaccination requirements that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made mandatory last year for all service members. The requirement applies to all active duty and Ready Reserve service members including the National Guardsmen.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/30/florida-school-boards-oust-superintendents-mask-mandates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/30/florida-school-boards-oust-superintendents-mask-mandates/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida School Boards Flip Red, Immediately Oust Superintendents Who Oversaw Mask Mandates</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two school boards with conservative majorities parted ways with their schools&rsquo; superintendents in November, both of whom oversaw the implementation of mask mandates into the fall of 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 29, Sarasota County Schools Superintendent Brennan Asplen agreed to step down after the school board criticized mask mandates which Asplen backed, while on Nov. 22 Brevard County Superintendent Mark Mullins, who faced backlash for supporting an extended mask mandate, agreed with the school board to enter into separation negotiations. Both school districts extended their mask mandates into the fall of the 2021-2022 school year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2021-2022 school year, Brevard Public Schools extended its emergency mask mandate through Nov. 28, giving parents an opt-out option, according to the school website. Sarasota County Schools implemented a mask mandate in August 2021 but it was repealed in October, according to the Herald-Tribune.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who endorsed recently elected members who flipped the school board majorities, signed an executive order in July 2021 requiring schools to give parents to opt their students out of school&rsquo;s mask mandates. The order came in response to schools implementing mask mandates in 2020, according to a press release by the governor&rsquo;s office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asplen, who took over in 2020, called the board&rsquo;s citing of his COVID-19 response &ldquo;ridiculous.&rdquo; School Board Chair Bridget Ziegler noted that the relationship between the board and the superintendent was broken.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moves by the Florida school boards come after the Berkeley County School Board in South Carolina, which flipped to a conservative majority, fired the school superintendent as well as the district&rsquo;s lawyer, banned Critical Race Theory from the classroom and set up a committee to review material flagged for pornographic content in its first meeting since being elected.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCP announces they will ease Covid restrictions in key cities amid White Paper Protests</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese city of Guanzhao has begun to ease Covid restrictions that have been in service to the nation's "zero Covid" policy, "announcing the lifting of all lockdowns," reports state-affiliated media outlet Hu Xijin. Lifting of Covid restrictions has been called something of a surrender, that the CCP is "throwing in the white flag."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Beijing has been gradually lifting lockdowns over the past few days," Hu Xijin futher reports. "Vice Premier Sun Chunlan on Wed formally noted the virus' weakening pathogenicity for the first time...China is speeding up to cast aside large-scale lockdowns." Officials in Zhengzhao, where Apple's Foxconn factory is located, announced an "orderly" return to business, opening supermarkets, gyms and restauarants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The southwestern city of Chongqing will allow the close-contacts of people with COVID-19, who fulfil certain conditions, to quarantine at home," Al-Jazeera reports. However, they also report that President Xi is unlikely to remove further restrictions, as Covid case counts are still reportedly at record levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes after the country has seen days of protests against Covid restrictions and lockdowns. The protests began after a fire in an apartment building in the city of Urumqi, which took the lives of 10, including a 3-year-old child.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is widely believed that firefighters were delayed in putting out the blaze due to lockdown restrictions which made it harder to gain access to the building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protests are the largest public display of anti-government behavior since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The protests also come shortly after the coronation of Xi Jinping at the national congress, essentially making the president leader of the country for life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CCP has been aggressive in their attempts to stop the White Paper Revolution protestors, who hold up white sheets of paper to oppose censorship. Apple has appeared to help the CCP, restricting the use of their AirDrop feature, which iPhone users can use to bypass the internet and internet censors and communicate phone to phone. Protests at the Foxconn Apple factory in Zhengzhao were squashed last week as the CCP instituted Covid restrictions to keep people locked down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country has been imposing mass testing requirements, separating family members who test positive, including young children. These restrictions and limitations have generated increasing anger in the Chinese populace, and Covid has continued to spread, despite these measures.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tom-brady-could-end-up-new-england-this-offseason-patriots-insider-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tom-brady-could-end-up-new-england-this-offseason-patriots-insider-says</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Brady could end up in New England this offseason, Patriots insider says</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Tom Brady reunion in New England?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Athletic&rsquo;s Jeff Howe, who has covered the Patriots for more than a decade, said, "Don&rsquo;t ever write off the Patriots," in a recent article that broke down where the veteran quarterback might play next season if he decides he wants to return for a 24th campaign in the NFL.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like Brady was forever done wearing red, white and navy blue when he moved on to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and ended up winning a Super Bowl there. But, as he&rsquo;s set to be a free agent once again after this season, Howe believes a reunion could be in the cards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howe added that no "egos" or "pride" would get in the way of Brady returning if it came down to that. Instead, the offensive play-calling under Matt Patricia would be questioned by Brady to make sure that he wouldn&rsquo;t be wasting his 24th season, considering that his days in the league are numbered (or so we all thought after he retired then decided not to in the same offseason).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on the Patriots&rsquo; end, they would also like to know what Brady plans to do. If it&rsquo;s a year-to-year decision, they may be less likely to want a reunion, especially after Mac Jones, the team&rsquo;s current starter, was drafted in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft to be their quarterback of the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones has played well, but Belichick has the obvious winning history with Brady. Howe doesn&rsquo;t think the Pats would even have to trade Jones because he&rsquo;s still under a lengthy, cheap rookie deal and could learn a lot from Brady.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, it&rsquo;s an option and pure speculation at this point because no one knows for sure if Brady will truly hang up the cleats for good after this season with the Bucs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howe also mentioned the San Francisco 49ers &mdash; Brady grew up a fan of them in San Mateo, California &mdash; the Tennessee Titans and the Las Vegas Raiders as potential destinations other than returning to Tampa Bay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This season, Brady hasn&rsquo;t seen the same offensive firepower he did in his first two seasons with the Bucs, as Bruce Arians' departure seems to have left a void. His offensive line troubles also haven&rsquo;t helped matters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers sit in first place in a dreadful NFC South at 5-6, with the Atlanta Falcons behind them at 5-7.</span></p>

<p>P Nate, #1 and Air-Jordan weigh in on the conference, the doc and what they took away.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/house-passes-biden-backed-bill-avert-rail-strike"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/house-passes-biden-backed-bill-avert-rail-strike</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House passes Biden-backed bill to avert rail strike</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to avert a national railroad strike, but questions remain about whether the effort can clear the 50-50 Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By an 290-137 vote, House lawmakers voted to pass legislation blocking nearly 100,000 railroad workers from striking in early December. Economists and the White House have warned that a railroad strike could paralyze the nation's economy ahead of the holiday season.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We must act to prevent a catastrophic strike that would touch the lives of nearly every family," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation gives unionized train engineers and conductors three unpaid sick days a year for medical appointments, provided employers are given at least 30 days' notice about the time off. It's based on an agreement that railroad companies and transportation unions agreed to in September. While eight unions have already adopted the agreement, four have not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standoff between the holdout unions and railroad companies has failed to resolve itself even as White House officials have become increasingly involved. President Biden said the failure to achieve a breakthrough forced him to ask Congress to intervene and prevent a strike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressives have lambasted Biden's decision to ask Congress to intervene. Far-left lawmakers, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., say Biden's request for Congress to approve legislation blocking nearly 100,000 railroad workers from striking was inappropriate given the unions were still pushing for broader paid sick leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House on Wednesday also passed a separate bill 221-207 giving railroad workers an additional seven days of sick leave. It remains to be seen if it will be included in the version the 50-50 divided Senate will take up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the upper chamber, at least 10 Republican votes are needed for the legislation to overcome a filibuster, provided all 50 Democrats fall in line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s keep it within the Biden administration shall we?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-non-binary-nuclear-official-charged-stealing-womans-luggage-airport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-non-binary-nuclear-official-charged-stealing-womans-luggage-airport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-binary Biden nuclear official charged with stealing woman's luggage at airport</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Brinton, a senior Energy Department (DOE) official, was charged with stealing a traveler's luggage in the Minneapolis airport in September, shortly before quietly taking a leave of absence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brinton &mdash; who serves as the DOE's deputy assistant secretary for spent fuel and waste disposition &mdash; allegedly took a Vera Bradley suitcase worth $2,325 from the luggage carousel at the Minneapolis St. Paul Airport (MSP) on Sept. 16, according to a criminal complaint filed on Oct. 26 in Minnesota state court and obtained by Fox News Digital. Brinton had traveled from Washington, D.C., to MSP that day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the suitcase's owner alerted police, officers reviewed video surveillance of the carousel and identified Brinton taking the luggage before removing its tag identifying the owner, the court filings stated. Law enforcement observed Brinton using the luggage during at least two other trips to Washington, D.C., on Sept. 18 and Oct. 9.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, on Oct. 9, Brinton denied stealing anything when a police officer called to discuss the incident. Brinton confirmed still possessing the suitcase.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"If I had taken the wrong bag, I am happy to return it, but I don&rsquo;t have any clothes for another individual," Brinton told the officer. "That was my clothes when I opened the bag."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two hours after the phone call, Brinton called the officer back and apologized for not being "completely honest." But Brinton said it was a mistake and blamed being tired for taking the wrong bag at the carousel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"DEFENDANT said when they opened the bag at the hotel, they realized it was not theirs," the court filings stated. "DEFENDANT got nervous people would think they stole the bag and did not know what to do. DEFENDANT stated they left the clothes from the bag inside the drawers in the hotel room."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brinton was ultimately charged with felony theft of a movable property without consent, a charge that could result in a five-year sentence, $10,000 fine or both.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanye Canceled &mdash; by Kanye; Walks Out of Tim Pool Interview When Asked to Defend His Antisemitism</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanye West, the rapper and entrepreneur who has become infamous for his antisemitic views, walked out of an interview Monday evening with podcaster Tim Pool the moment the host mildly challenged his views on Jews.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1597401435549110272"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1597401435549110272</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interview, which was streamed live on YouTube, included Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulous, who has recently joined West&rsquo;s entourage and nascent 2024 presidential campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pool allowed West to express his views, largely uninterrupted, for the first fifteen minutes of the broadcast. He claimed that his recent, controversial dinner with former President Donald Trump had been scheduled last month &mdash; apparently before West began making antisemitic comments such as the infamous &ldquo;death con&rdquo; tweet. The dinner was postponed until after the midterm elections; West confirmed that Trump did not know Fuentes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West claimed that it was &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; that people could see how Jews &mdash; whom he referred to as &ldquo;Zionists&rdquo; at one stage &mdash; cancel people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luke Rudkowski, one of Pool&rsquo;s co-hosts, said that West said as he was leaving: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in my truths.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News out of England&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Census: Christians a Minority in England; Non-religious Grow</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fewer than half the people in England and Wales consider themselves Christian, according to the most recent census &mdash; the first time the country's official religion has been followed by a minority of the population.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain has become less religious &mdash; and less white &mdash; in the decade since the last census, figures from the 2021 census released Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 46.2% of the population of England and Wales described themselves as Christian on the day of the 2021 census, down from 59.3% a decade earlier. The Muslim population grew from 4.9% to 6.5% of the population, while 1.7% identified as Hindu, up from 1.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 1 in 3 people &mdash; 37% &mdash; said they had no religion, up from 25% in 2011.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other parts of the U.K., Scotland and Northern Ireland, report their census results separately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secularism campaigners said the shift should trigger a rethink of the way religion is entrenched in British society. The U.K. has state-funded Church of England schools, Anglican bishops sit in Parliament's upper chamber, and the monarch is "defender of the faith" and supreme governor of the church.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Copson, chief executive of the charity Humanists U.K., said "the dramatic growth of the non-religious" had made the U.K. "almost certainly one of the least religious countries on Earth."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, one of the most senior clerics in the Church of England, said the data was "not a great surprise," but was a challenge to Christians to work harder to promote their faith.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have left behind the era when many people almost automatically identified as Christian, but other surveys consistently show how the same people still seek spiritual truth and wisdom and a set of values to live by," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 82% of people in England and Wales identified as white in the census, down from 86% in 2011. Some 9% said they were Asian, 4% Black and 3% from "mixed or multiple" ethnic backgrounds, while 2% identified with another ethnic group.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESPN Host Stephen A. Smith Apologizes For Using The Term &ldquo;Homosexual&rdquo; While Discussing Profanity-Laced Lamar Jackson Tweet</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson took offense at Twitter user CastleWillKill sharing his opinion that the Baltimore Ravens should let him walk rather than pay him $250 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CastleWillKill tweeted, &ldquo;When someone is asking for over 250 mil guaranteed like Lamar Jackson &hellip; games like this should not come to Justin Tucker. Let Lamar walk and spend that money on a well rounded team.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamar Jackson responded with a profanity laced tweet, to which Stephen A. Smith responded to, like so:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by Awful Announcing, Smith would later apologize for using the term &ldquo;homosexual&rdquo; while discussing Jackson&rsquo;s tweet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is absolutely no reason to apologize for using the term homosexual over gay. In fact, Smith should have used the word Sodomite instead.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This week&rsquo;s Pugcast presents a rich conversation with Dr. Michael Hanby, Associate Professor of Religion and Philosophy of Science at the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family at the Catholic University of America. Dr. Hanby has been at the forefront of cultural analysis with works critically engaging modern science and sociology, unmasking their problematic theological and philosophical underpinnings, unpacking the cultural havoc such underpinnings have resulted in. In view of his recent talk at the Touchstone Conference, The Politics of Nothingness, where Dr. Hanby digs deeply into the flood of causes which have led to the present crises in our culture, the Pugsters have a deep conversation with Dr. Hanby, especially about the important work of Augusto Del Noce on the Problem of Atheism. This conversation is a real treat!</p>

I hope y&rsquo;all have been having a good week&hellip; and before we get to the news, do you want your kids to be able to take on our wicked culture, and be dangerous? Look no further than NSA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Saint Andrews:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&rsquo;s culture shifts like sand. But New Saint Andrews College is established on Christ, the immovable rock. It is a premier institution that forges evangelical leaders who don&rsquo;t fear or hate the world. Guided by God&rsquo;s Word, they take the world back because they&rsquo;re equipped with the genius of classical liberal arts and God-honoring wisdom, thanks to a faculty dedicated to academic rigor and to God&rsquo;s kingdom.Find out more, at nsa.edu/</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHITE PAPER REVOLUTION SPREADS: Anti-CCP protests break out worldwide as Chinese students demonstrate in key cities</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following days of ongoing protests in China, the "White Paper Revolution" has spread outside of the country, with protestors across the globe, many of Chinese descent, standing in solidarity with those in China protesting their country&rsquo;s "Zero Covid" policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, college students at University of California Berkeley, NYU, and Columbia University gathered on their campuses, carrying white sheets of paper as those in China have been doing. The blank, white pages are a symbol of protest against Chinese censors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Berkeley, students set up a candlelight vigil for the victims of a fire in a Urumqi apartment building. At least 10 people died in the fire after months of a strict Covid lockdown saw residents locked inside of their homes by officials. Lockdowns were blamed for the inability of fire fighters to put out the blaze fast enough, in which a 3-year-old was among the casualties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protestors on Berkeley&rsquo;s campus set fire to a masked Winnie the Pooh stuffed animal, representing Chinese President Xi Jinping.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students from NYU gathered in New York City&rsquo;s Washington Square Park to protest in solidarity with Chinese citizens stepping up in their own country, setting up another candlelight vigil.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protestors in the square chanted "no lockdown, but freedom. No lies, but dignity. No Cultural Revolution, but reform. No supreme leaders, but votes. No slaves, but citizens. Twitter user Indy posted the footage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1597033132615602176"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1597033132615602176</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Columbia University in New York City, protestors used facemasks to cover the face of a statue that sits iconically before the schools largest library.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protestors held a banner that read, "Chinese Community Party, Step Down! Give Me Liberty of Death!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrations were also seen in Tokyo, Japan, with Chinese students protesting outside of the city&rsquo;s Chinese Embassy while holding white sheets of paper.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In London, England, protestors chanted "down with the party, down with Xi Jinping, Free China," flying the flag of East Turkestan, the region of China where the apartment fire broke out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protests had sparked in China following the Urumqi apartment fire last week. Chinese citizens took to the streets in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing in opposition of the country&rsquo;s "Zero Covid" policy, which issues strict restrictions for those found to be positive for the virus, including separating them from those who test negative, like family members.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/desantis-slams-apple-as-vassal-of-the-ccp-after-it-removes-airdrop-from-chinese-iphones?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/desantis-slams-apple-as-vassal-of-the-ccp-after-it-removes-airdrop-from-chinese-iphones?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis SLAMS Apple as 'vassal of the CCP' after it limits AirDrop on Chinese iPhones</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple has beed accused of being vassals for the Chinese Communist Party by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis after the tech giant restricted its AirDrop feature amid White Paper Revolution protests breaking out across the country. Chinese citizens are demonstrating against the CCP's lockdown policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The criticism comes as Apple and Google consider pulling Twitter from their respective app stores in response to owner Elon Musk's new free speech policies, which include dropping restrictions around so-called Covid disinformation. They have been encouraged to do so by some American journalists, including those at the Washington Post. Musk has said he is a free speech absolutist, and believes the platform should be open to discourse and should not engage in censorship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AirDrop feature is a vital tool for those in authoritarian countries, as the feature uses direct connections between phones rather than using any internet signal to communicate. On November 9, Apple released its new iOS. The update made it so that iPhones sold in mainland China can only receive messages from people for just 10 minutes before the function stops working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. DeSantis made several comments about China during a media appearance on Tuesday, where he accused Apple of being a "vassal of the CCP," and warned that "nuking" Twitter off the app store would be anti-free speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v1xw06a-desantis-slams-apple-for-being-a-vassal-of-the-ccp..html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v1xw06a-desantis-slams-apple-for-being-a-vassal-of-the-ccp..html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, Musk said that he was prepared to "go to war" with Apple over the prospect it pulling the app. In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk said that it is a "real problem" that Apple and Google "effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protests in China have raged on across several cities in respose to extreme measures taken by the CCP under President Xi Jinping. On Monday, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby was asked why the Biden administration had not responded more strongly in support of the ongoing people's protests in China against that country's authoritarian regime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirby said, "We're watching this closely as you might expect, we would. And again, we continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest. And I think we're gonna watch this closely and we'll see where things go."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirby said that President Biden would not be speaking on behalf of protestors, and that the protestors are "speaking for themselves."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Big Tech:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/google-youtube-spend-millions-to-launch-global-fact-check-fund?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/google-youtube-spend-millions-to-launch-global-fact-check-fund?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, YouTube spend MILLIONS to launch Global Fact Check Fund</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Google and YouTube announced that they will be providing a $13.2 million grant to the nonprofit Poynter Institute's International Fact Checking Network with the goal of launching a new "Global Fact Check Fund," set to launch in early 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move, which marks the companies' largest fact-checking grant to date, comes as they continue to ramp up their fight against "misinformation" online.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Google and YouTube, the grant will "support [the Poynter Institute's] network of 135 fact-checking organizations from 65 countries covering over 80 languages."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The companies justified their decision by noting that "helping people to identify misinformation is a global challenge."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Global Fact Check Fund," they explained, "will help fact-checkers to scale existing operations or launch new ones that elevate information, uplift credible sources and reduce the harm of mis- and disinformation around the globe."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations are expected to use the funding to "incorporate new technologies, create or expand digital footprints, optimize verification tools, and increase their capacities to deepen audience engagement through innovative storytelling formats such as audio, video, or podcasts."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The world needs fact-checking more than ever before," IFCN executive director Baybars &Ouml;rsek said. "This partnership with Google and YouTube infuses financial support to global fact-checkers and is a step in the right direction, and while there&rsquo;s much work to be done, this partnership has sparked meaningful collaboration and an important step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, investments in programs aimed at tackling mis- and disinformation online have grown in tandem with peoples' interest and awareness in the subject.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from Google, in October 2022, interest in mis- and disinformation across the world reached its highest point since 2004, when records began, with the most pressing topic being the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, big tech's fact-checking apparatus went into overdrive as companies struggled to keep up with information that seemed to be changing on a daily, if not hourly basis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube has been criticized for its crackdowns on those who shared ideas that opposed the mainstream, many of whom have had their views vindicated in the months since.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.based-politics.com/2022/11/29/biden-rushing-to-track-the-20-billion-we-gave-ukraine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.based-politics.com/2022/11/29/biden-rushing-to-track-the-20-billion-we-gave-ukraine/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden rushing to track the $20 billion we gave Ukraine</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans, who are poised to take control of the House in January, have promised to audit the immense amount of money our Congress has been shipping off to fight another country&rsquo;s war. Among the goals of the audit would be determining how much of the money ended up in the &ldquo;wrong hands&rdquo; as previous tracking efforts proved the Biden administration only inspected a small fraction of the funds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are not without allies across the aisle in this effort. As it turns out, there are still a few, truly and consistently, anti-war folks left on the Democrat&rsquo;s bench who share the GOP&rsquo;s concern over our involvement in this conflict.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The taxpayers deserve to know that investment is going where it&rsquo;s intended to go,&rdquo; Rep. Jason Crow, D (CO), said. &ldquo;In any war, there can be missteps and misallocation of supplies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to reports, only 10% of the 22,000 weapons the US gave Ukraine between February and November 1 have been inspected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The threats of an audit have led to a lot of handwringing by warmongers in both parties, as well as overseas. Members of Parliament have worried out loud that these investigations may lead to the US cutting its funding to Ukraine altogether&hellip;which would be, umm, ideal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we should absolutely not be involved in this proxy war that is threatening global peace, spurring an energy crisis, and deepening the recession many countries including our own are experiencing, a basic audit of the funds is the bare minimum here. It is outrageous that we&rsquo;re sending billions of dollars to this cause at all, much less without any idea how they are being utilized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Congressional leaders, namely Rand Paul, have been working to mandate such oversight for some time and have largely been opposed by both Republican and Democrats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enter a war, the US is supposed to require a vote by all members of Congress. That hasn&rsquo;t happened in over two decades while, at the same time, we have invested trillions of taxpayer dollars and given up thousands of American lives involving ourselves in conflicts that don&rsquo;t pertain to us and that the American people never got to vote on.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monkeypox Gets Canceled: WHO Says Name is Racist, Changes It to &lsquo;Mpox&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what seems to be another foray into left wing &ldquo;logic,&rdquo; the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Monday that they would no longer use the term &ldquo;monkeypox&rdquo; because of &ldquo;racist and stigmatizing language&rdquo; over usage of the term.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHO released a statement which read in part, &ldquo;Following a series of consultations with global experts, WHO will begin using a new preferred term &lsquo;mpox&rsquo; as a synonym for monkeypox. Both names will be used simultaneously for one year while &lsquo;monkeypox&rsquo; is phased out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend of renaming diseases is not a new one. Political correctness was front and center for WHO as far back as 2015 when they released &ldquo;Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Diseases.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, WHO stated that new disease names should be assigned, &ldquo;with the aim to minimize unnecessary negative impact of disease names on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare, and avoid causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An earlier announcement was made in June after approximately thirty scientists declared there was, &ldquo;urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing nomenclature for the monkeypox virus.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration, in their never ending search for perfect political correctness compliance, had already privately urged a name change, arguing that calling it monkeypox could be hampering vaccination efforts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/11/nhl-denies-the-truth-and-reality-embraces-and-promotes-transgender-idol-worship/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/11/nhl-denies-the-truth-and-reality-embraces-and-promotes-transgender-idol-worship/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NHL Denies The Truth And Reality, Embraces And Promotes Transgender Idol Worship</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Hockey League made it abundantly clear they now worship at the altar of transgenderism when they recently declared that they deny reality by claiming that men can become women and women can become men.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization posted to Twitter their support of a Team Trans Draft Tournament that was held in Middleton, Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They wrote, &ldquo;The NHL is proud to support this past weekend&rsquo;s Team Trans Draft Tournament in Middleton, Wisconsin. This was the first tournament comprised entirely of transgender and nonbinary players, with around 80 folks participating!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization took it a step further when they responded to a user who asked, &ldquo;So, men playing on womans team?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The league responded, &ldquo;Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Nonbinary identity is real.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tweet and the celebration of the tournament are not only a denial of reality, they are promoting other people to embrace in this denial of reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This statement of idol worship comes a little over a month after the NHL embraced anti-white racism where they claimed in their Accelerating Diversity &amp; Inclusion report that the organization&rsquo;s teams are too white. In order to address what they view as a problem they revealed plans to reduce the percentage of white people that work for them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welp, there you go&hellip; hockey is dead. What do you make of the NHL worshiping at the altar of transgenderism and encouraging others to join in their idolatry?</span></p>

<p>Ezra Institute Fellow Dr. James White joins us this week to talk about the Protestant fascination with Aquinas, and the path that leads from Thomism to Roman Catholicism. Dr. White explains some of the reasons why Protestants are induced to follow Thomas, the fundamental issue of authority that is at stake, and what Thomas would have thought of the current Pope.</p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/179c0a52-afe9-49a8-bae9-8a7fc3f73e13/daily-news-brief-for-tuesday-november-29th-2022.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Tuesday, November 29th, 2022. I hope you guys had an excellent Thanksgiving with you and your loved ones&hellip; and that y&rsquo;all are healthy as we head into the cold and flu season&hellip; and ya know, one of our sponsors Armored Republic, may not be able to help with the flu, but they can help with fighting tyranny!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

In the Armored Republic there is no King but Christ. We are Free Craftsmen. Body Armor is a Tool of Liberty. We create Tools of Liberty.

Armored Republic is honored to offer you those Tools. Visit them, at ar500armor.com</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of tyranny&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/clashes-in-shanghai-as-covid-protests-flare-across-china-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/clashes-in-shanghai-as-covid-protests-flare-across-china-2</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clashes in Shanghai as COVID protests flare across China</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of demonstrators and police clashed in Shanghai on Sunday night as protests over China&rsquo;s stringent COVID restrictions flared for a third day and spread to several cities in the wake of a deadly apartment fire in the country&rsquo;s far west.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wave of civil disobedience is unprecedented in mainland China since President Xi Jinping assumed power a decade ago, as frustration mounts over his signature zero-COVID policy nearly three years into the pandemic. The COVID measures are also exacting a heavy toll on the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here because I love my country, but I don&rsquo;t love my government &hellip; I want to be able to go out freely, but I can&rsquo;t. Our COVID-19 policy is a game and is not based on science or reality,&rdquo; said a protester in the financial hub named Shaun Xiao.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protesters also took to the streets in the cities of Wuhan and Chengdu on Sunday. In Beijing, small gatherings held peaceful vigils, while students on numerous university campuses around China gathered to demonstrate over the weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fire on Thursday at a residential high-rise building in the city of Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region, triggered protests after videos of the incident posted on social media led to accusations that lockdowns were a factor in the blaze that killed 10 people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urumqi officials abruptly held a news conference in the early hours of Saturday to deny COVID measures had hampered escape and rescue efforts. Many of Urumqi&rsquo;s 4 million residents have been under some of the country&rsquo;s longest lockdowns, barred from leaving their homes for as long as 100 days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday in Shanghai, police kept a heavy presence on Wulumuqi Road, which is named after Urumqi, and where a candlelight vigil the day before turned into protests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We just want our basic human rights. We can&rsquo;t leave our homes without getting a test. It was the accident in Xinjiang that pushed people too far,&rdquo; said a 26-year-old protester in Shanghai who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The people here aren&rsquo;t violent, but the police are arresting them for no reason. They tried to grab me but the people all around me grabbed my arms so hard and pulled me back so I could escape.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Sunday evening, hundreds of people gathered in the area. Some jostled with police trying to disperse them. People held up blank sheets of paper as an expression of protest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Reuters witness saw police escorting people onto a bus which was later driven away through the crowd with a few dozen people on board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday, the vigil in Shanghai for victims of the apartment fire turned into a protest against COVID curbs, with the crowd chanting calls for lockdowns to be lifted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From one tyrannical government to another:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Canadians Being Driven to Euthanasia to Escape Crippling Poverty</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Farsoud was on the verge of being homeless and admitted his health condition would not allow him to survive on the streets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farsoud said that he did not want to die but could not afford to find another place to live, and instead opted for the country&rsquo;s assisted suicide laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City News Reporter Cynthia Mulligan said: &ldquo;Amir Farsoud has applied for medically assisted dying, known as (MAiD) he lives in constant agony due to a back injury but has started the process for end of life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Because his rooming house is up for sale and he can&rsquo;t find anywhere else to live that he can afford,&rdquo; Mulligan added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, a Canadian woman with a chronic health also chose to end her life under the country&rsquo;s assisted suicide laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, another woman, suffering from the same condition, reached the approval to end her life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Guardian reported at the time:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, a 51-year-old Ontario woman known as Sophia was granted physician-assisted death after her chronic condition became intolerable and her meager disability stipend left her little to survive on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The government sees me as expendable trash, a complainer, useless and a pain in the ass,&rdquo; she said in a video obtained by the network. For two years, she and friends had pleaded without success for better living conditions, she said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now a second case has emerged with several parallels: another woman, known as Denise, has also applied to end her life after being unable to find suitable housing and struggling to survive on disability payments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both were diagnosed with multiple chemical sensitivity (MCR), a condition in which common chemicals, such as those in cigarette smoke and laundry detergents, can trigger nausea, blinding headaches and in extreme cases, anaphylactic shock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Forbes reported earlier this month, Canada is often cited by those concerned about medically assisted dying as evidence of a &lsquo;slippery slope. Its MAID (Medical Assistance in Dying) law was introduced in 2016 for adults with conditions where death is reasonably foreseeable &ndash; expected within six months. It was extended to those with severe chronic but not terminal physical ailments in 2021 and will be further made available to those with severe chronic mental conditions in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently under consideration is the possibility of advance directives for people falling into conditions like dementia that will remove decision-making ability.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, this progression is proof of a &lsquo;slippery slope&rsquo; &ndash; once one element is allowed, others will inevitably follow until almost anything is permitted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For others, it is a careful and considered roll-out of a new set of laws &ndash; up to, but not beyond, a logical and morally defensible limit. In truth, Canada is not particularly exceptional in its approach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything currently permitted there is also available in a number of other countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada reversed 22 years of its jurisprudence by striking down the country&rsquo;s ban on assisted suicide as unconstitutional, blithely dismissing fears that the ruling would &lsquo;initiate a descent down a slippery slope into homicide&rsquo; against the vulnerable as founded on &lsquo;anecdotal examples.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next year, Parliament duly enacted legislation allowing euthanasia, but only for those who suffer from a terminal illness whose natural death was &lsquo;reasonably foreseeable,&rsquo; the spectator reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on that note&hellip; how about some good news?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2022/11/27/handgun-owners-carrying-daily-in-us-doubled-in-4-years-poll-finds-n2616399"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2022/11/27/handgun-owners-carrying-daily-in-us-doubled-in-4-years-poll-finds-n2616399</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handgun Owners Carrying Daily Doubled Thanks to Soft-on-Crime Woke Policies</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans feel less safe under President Joe Biden, and thanks to soft-on-crime woke cities, crime has surged during the last two years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Biden continues to threaten the Second Amendment, Americans are taking their safety into their hands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a new study by the University of Washington, the number of U.S. adult handgun owners carrying daily nearly doubled in four years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The November 16 study found that 6 million adults carried a firearm on themselves in 2019, which is up by 3 million in 2015.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-protection was cited as the main reason for the uptick in gun holders, with seven out of 10 saying that they carry a gun to protect themselves against other people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, only 9 million people reported carrying a handgun. Now, at least 16 million people say they carry a loaded weapon on them at least once a month.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total number of Americans owning handguns spiked from 38 million to 53 million in just a few short years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes as Biden called to ban assault rifles, claiming that it is &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; red flag laws are not being enforced throughout the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is going to attempt to pass a bill on the matter during Congress&rsquo; lame-duck session, right before Republicans take over the House, which they would most likely veto any sort of gun restricting laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans have heard time and time again from Democrats how more gun laws need to be enacted. Calling it &ldquo;sick&rdquo; that semi-automatic weapons are still allowed, Biden has zeroed in on trying to &ldquo;get rid of assault weapons.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now finally today, this one hits close to home here in Moscow Idaho, and we ask for your prayers for the police investigating this case, as well as for the families of those who lost loved ones:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-student-murders-update-police-why-key-details-withheld-from-public"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-student-murders-update-police-why-key-details-withheld-from-public</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho Student murders update: Police say why key details are being withheld from the public</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks have passed since authorities first began investigating the brutal murders of four University of Idaho students in Moscow, Idaho and no suspect or person of interest has been identified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police have also not yet provided key details surrounding the murders of Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, but they are doing so intentionally, according to Aaron Snell of the Idaho State Police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an interview on Fox News&rsquo; "Lawrence Jones Cross Country," Snell told host Lawrence Jones that investigators "don't currently have a suspect" but that keeping certain information "from view is going to be critical into trying to develop that."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Idaho police communications director answered: "It will potentially put more fear, more suspicion on a wide variety of people versus if we use that to really refine where we're at in our investigation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones also spoke with former NYPD Inspector Paul Mauro, who similarly confirmed that information from criminal profilers and evidence collected at the scene was being withheld.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mauro said Saturday evening that in addition to protecting the integrity of the investigation, the scarcity of key details that have been released to the public could lead investigators to swiftly find a suspect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A murder weapon has also not been found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four students were found dead at a house just yards from the U of I campus, hours after police say someone attacked them in their sleep.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snell said authorities also believe the attack "was a targeted incident" toward one or more of the three women who lived there. Chapin, the sole male victim did not live at the home and was visiting his girlfriend, Kernodle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for who was the target, that information is not publicly known.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snell also assured community members that investigators are utilizing the best technology available to get a picture of the series of events of Nov. 13.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another concern Snell addressed is the potential contamination of the crime scene, as two roommates are believed to have been in the home at the time of the murders. They are cooperative and have been ruled out as suspects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other people were invited into the home between when the bodies were initially found and when law enforcement arrived but Snell said the investigation was not compromised.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All individuals who were in the home when police arrived have been cleared.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor!</p>
<p>It's nearly December, and things are hectic around here. So, we're REPOSTING the very first podcast episodes we ever published!&nbsp; &nbsp;These were the days long before we joined the Fight Laugh Feast Network--when we sat around a tiny, hand-held recorder at JOHN'S house (not the Peaches' house), and we let the dog in and out while we chatted about culture, faith, and family.&nbsp;<br /><br />On this inaugural episode:</p>
<div>We explain the purpose of the podcast is to invite our neighbors into the chaos of our everyday life, for good conversation. There are some clicks, pops, and other technical issues with the recording because the producer is an amateurish hack who lacks even basic recording skills.&nbsp; He improves in future episodes...(kind of).</div>
<p>The Peaches and John discuss the usefulness of spirited debate in culture and religion.&nbsp; We also discuss whether or not Cami should have a snack.</p>
<p>This was first broadcasted in the fall of 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reach out to the Comedian Next Door, email <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>.&nbsp; Also, visit johnbranyan.com to get your tickets to Vacay with Comics 2023. It's going to be epic.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">What happened to fertility around the world? The numbers have dropped dramatically. Once we talked about the "Population Bomb.&rdquo; Now people talk about the "Birth Dearth.&rdquo; It seems counterintuitive that we have fewer kids the more we can afford them. Kevin DeYoung recently discussed the Case for Kids in an important essay published in First Things in the November 2022 issue. The Pugsters talk to Kevin about this important subject and why he thinks that it is a spiritual malaise that is at the root of it.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Wednesday, November 23, 2022. I&rsquo;m back ladies and gentleman! Gabe and I have made our return from Waterloo Canada, and the Church at War Conference; where we were able to fellowship with the likes of Pastor Tim Stephens, Jacob Raome, and Pastor James Coates, among a whole bevy of other rowdy Christians, who gave up their comforts, their careers, and sometimes, their families, for our King, Jesus Christ. Keep our brothers and sisters in Canada in your prayers as they make war against their wicked culture. Before I dive into the news:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this! White House shuts down reporter's Fauci question on COVID origin: 'I'm done with you'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/dl77nDxM47o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://youtu.be/dl77nDxM47o</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -Play 0:40-1:56</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa&hellip; order in the court ladies and gentleman!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre snapped at reporters who raised questions about the origins of COVID-19 during Tuesday's press briefing, which featured outgoing White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During questions after the White House coronavirus response team updated reporters on the administration's vaccine efforts, Daily Caller White House correspondent Diana Glebova attempted to ask a question regarding what Fauci has done to investigate the origins of COVID-19. But Jean-Pierre shut Glebova down and rebuked her for speaking out of turn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Today News Africa journalist Simon Ateba spoke up and said her question was valid and should be asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You need to call people across the room. She has a valid question, she's asked about the origin of COVID," Ateba said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fauci, who will step down as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in December, has faced questions from Republican lawmakers over his agency's support for coronavirus research in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIAID has provided millions of dollars in grant funding to EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit group that GOP critics claim has supported bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawmakers interested in the lab-leak origins theory of COVID-19 want to probe whether that research was the genesis of the pandemic and whether Fauci played any role in approving money that was sent to the Wuhan lab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/here-where-last-uncalled-house-races-stand-two-weeks-election-day"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/here-where-last-uncalled-house-races-stand-two-weeks-election-day</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is where the last uncalled House races stand two weeks from Election Day</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As results from midterms elections continue to trickle in two weeks past Election Day, four critical House races in Alaska, California and Colorado still remain uncalled.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Digital breaks down the outstanding races and what is taking so long.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California, which has two of the four uncalled races, is a predominately vote-by-mail state, meaning every registered voter is automatically mailed a ballot 29 days prior to Election Day. With 22 million registered voters and weeks-long processing times, this means race calls can move very slowly in the Golden State.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California still has 593,925 remaining ballots to be counted, according to estimates from the California Secretary of State's report on Monday. Of the unprocessed ballots remaining, about 500,000 of these ballots were mailed in Election Officials. California permits election authorities one month to complete tallying which mean voters could be waiting as late as Dec. 8 for final race outcomes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In California's 3rd Congressional District, Republican Kevin Kiley holds a commanding lead over Democrat Kermit Jones; however, approximately only a little over half of ballots have been counted in the "likely Republican" race. California accepts mail-ballots for the week following Election Day, although the ballots must be postmarked by Nov. 8. The ballots must also go through a signature verification process before being counted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second uncalled race in California lies in the state's 13th Congressional District. This toss-up race is among the tightest remaining as Republican John Duarte narrowly leads Democrat Adam Gray by less than 800 votes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska's At-Large Congressional District still remains uncalled, held up by the vote counting process of the state's newly implemented ranked-choice voting system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seat has been rated by Fox News' Power Rankings as "lean Democratic" as a result of the ranked-choice system that gives incumbent Democrat Rep. Mary Peltola an advantage against her Republican opponents, former Gov. Sarah Palin and Nick Begich.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peltola led in the first round of the vote, with Palin in second and Begich in third, but failed to secure 50%, meaning those who voted for the candidate with the least number of votes will have their second choice vote reallocated to the other candidates until one reaches 50%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials will commence the counting of second- and third-place votes Nov. 23, meaning that Alaskans may know the final outcome of the House race by end of day, if all goes as expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado predominantly votes by mail, but processing is much swifter than California. In 2020, 90% of the vote was counted by Wednesday morning after Election Day, according to the Associated Press. Even so, mail-in ballots from out of state and overseas military service members can arrive as late as Wednesday as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite relatively speedier ballot processing times, Colorado's 3rd House district still remains too close to call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incumbent Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert was not expected to have such a close race with her Democratic opponent, Adam Frisch, in the "likely Republican" seat. The one-term congresswoman is narrowly leading the vote count by a little more than 500 votes, according to the Associated Press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the race qualifies for a recount under Colorado state law, Frisch conceded to Boebert on Friday. However, the Associated Press has still not called the race as of Tuesday.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ap-fires-reporter-responsible-for-fake-story-alleging-russian-missiles-hit-poland?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ap-fires-reporter-responsible-for-fake-story-alleging-russian-missiles-hit-poland?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AP fires reporter responsible for fake story alleging Russian missiles hit Poland</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press has reportedly fired journalist Jim LaPorta, who was one of two bylines that ran with the false report that Russian missiles hit Poland. The only source of that story was anonymous, which goes against AP's policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retracted story alleged that a senior US intelligence official said that Russian missiles "crossed into NATO member Poland, killing two people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story was taken down the next day and replaced with an editor's note stating that the story was false and that "subsequent reporting showed that the missiles were Russian-made and most likely fired by Ukraine in defense against a Russian attack."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AP's news values and principles state that there must be more than one anonymous source to run a story unless the "material comes from an authoritative figure who provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy," the AP said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaPorta wrote the article along with John Leicester, who is still working with AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/11/21/gen-z-whose-votes-bolstered-democrats-in-the-mid-terms-are-suffering-massive-pandemic-induced-depression/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/11/21/gen-z-whose-votes-bolstered-democrats-in-the-mid-terms-are-suffering-massive-pandemic-induced-depression/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gen Z &ndash; Whose Votes Bolstered Democrats in the Mid Terms &ndash; Are Suffering Massive Pandemic-Induced Depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of Gen Zers are struggling with mental health problems, according to a new survey, which reveals many of these problems were first identified during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is further evidence of the serious health consequences caused by the social-distancing measures taken in response to the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation Z is the third-largest population in America, after millennials and baby boomers. While Zoomers are often singled out for praise by the corporate media for racial and sexual diversity, it&rsquo;s also becoming clear many of them are suffering mental health issues to a far greater degree than earlier generations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey was carried out by Harmony Healthcare IT, an Indiana-based data-management company. Just over 1000 individuals aged 18 to 24, with a roughly equal gender balance, were asked a range of detailed questions about their mental health.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-two percent of those surveyed said they were suffering from a diagnosed mental-health problem, with 25 percent saying their diagnosis took place during the pandemic.&nbsp; Anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and bulimia were just some of the conditions the respondents reported. By comparison with millennials or Gen X-ers, Zoomers are twice as likely to report struggling with emotional distress on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near 70 percent said that they felt the pandemic had a negative effect on their mental health. Zoomers appear to be deeply anxious, with 85 percent saying they were worried about the future. Nine out of ten Zoomers diagnosed with a mental-health issue have anxiety and eight out of ten suffer from depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particular concerns for Zoomers include personal finances, the economy, their health, the environment, politics, and the workplace. Three-quarters of Zoomers say they feel disadvantaged by comparison with older generations, and 90 percent have a hard time picturing a stable future for themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty percent of the study participants said they have a regular therapist, while 57 percent take regular medication and 39 percent attend therapy for mental health issues at least once a week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandemic Damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study is further evidence that the pandemic &ndash; in particular the social-distancing measures adopted by most governments around the world &ndash; had serious adverse consequences for the young that far outstrip any damage they might have suffered from contracting the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other studies have already substantiated the mental effects of isolation and exposure to fear and uncertainty about the virus&rsquo;s effects. A meta-analysis from the University of Calgary suggested that as many as one in four children worldwide are now suffering from depression and anxiety as a result of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These unintended effects have not just been psychological. A recent study showed children are exercising less and spending more time sitting down than ever before as a result of the pandemic. Researchers at the University of Bristol revealed that fewer than four out of 10 children were doing sufficient daily exercise at the end of 2021. Obesity rates have risen at a &ldquo;staggering&rdquo; pace, according to the American CDC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The restrictions are even believed to have affected babies in the womb. A study based on a review of 250 babies born in New York between March and December 2020 suggested that the pandemic had serious adverse developmental effects on newborns, even if the mother had not had COVID-19 during the pregnancy. The researchers believe that increased maternal stress during pregnancy may be to blame, as well as reduced interactions with other infants and more stressful interactions with parents and caregivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like the effects of the pandemic and the overzealous responses of government &ldquo;experts&rdquo; will continue to ramify through the increasingly unhappy lives of our younger generations, long after COVID-19 itself becomes a distant memory.</span></p>
