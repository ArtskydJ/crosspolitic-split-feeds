   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, July 11th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/ban-on-transgender-surgery-for-tennessee-children-goes-into-effect"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/ban-on-transgender-surgery-for-tennessee-children-goes-into-effect</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee's ban on transgender surgery for kids goes into effect immediately, federal appeals court rules</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee can implement its ban on transgender surgery and related medical interventions for minors as a case challenging the law works its way through the court, a divided federal appeals court panel ruled Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee's 44th House District Representative William Lamberth (R) wrote on Twitter Saturday: "I am thankful to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals for confirming what Tennesseans already know: Children cannot give consent to experimental medical procedures or drugs that destroy their healthy bodies,"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennessee law now in effect, at least temporarily, prohibits surgical procedures and administration of hormones or puberty blockers for the purpose of gender transition, as Reason explains.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Thapar joined Sutton, concluding that the lower court had wrongly stopped the law's implementation. Judge White delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ban, originally set to take effect July 1, will now take effect immediately. The ban was held up when a lower court sided with the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee. ACLU-TN argued that the law interfered with parental rights and was unconstitutional, as The Hill reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first federal court to allow such a ban, with other courts unanimously blocking similar bans in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Indiana, and Kentucky, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU-TN brought the suit on behalf of Samantha and Brian Williams of Nashville and their 15-year-old daughter, as well as two other anonymous families and Dr. Susan N. Lac.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/09/portland-distribute-foil-straws-snorting-kits-paraphernalia-drug-addicts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/09/portland-distribute-foil-straws-snorting-kits-paraphernalia-drug-addicts/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>City To Distribute Foil, Straws, Snorting Kits To Drug Addicts</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health officials in Portland, Oregon announced last week they will begin handing out tin foil, straws and snorting kits to drug addicts throughout the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its &ldquo;Harm Reduction Program,&rdquo; the Multnomah County Health Department announced Friday that drug paraphernalia will be offered to those using fentanyl and other hard drugs, KOIN 6 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of fentanyl has decreased the need for needle-focused &ldquo;harm reduction&rdquo; services, Department spokeswoman Sarah Dean told the Willamette Week. Since fentanyl is smoked rather than injected, clinic visits have dropped 60% since 2019, Dean said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is backed by Multnomah County&rsquo;s Public Health Director, Jessica Guernsey, who says, &ldquo;The new part of the program is that we&rsquo;re adding supplies for people who smoke drugs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others are not happy with the move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This misguided approach also results in greater risk to public safety for those who simply want to enjoy our city without walking through a cloud of toxic smoke,&rdquo; Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said. &ldquo;Our community would benefit more from the County using its funding to urgently increase treatment and sobering facilities rather than actively enabling this deadly epidemic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean countered the mayor&rsquo;s statement by claiming providing drug paraphernalia does not increase drug use but encourages addicts to visit clinics where they can get access to fentanyl test strips and the overdose antidote, Narcan, KOIN 6 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Oregon Legislative Assembly recently passed a bill decriminalizing the distribution of &ldquo;drug paraphernalia&rdquo; for harm reduction purposes, according to the Willamette Week. Similar programs have been launched in Washington and California. In New York City, vending machines with smoking kits and bubble pipes have recently been installed, the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Oregon bill to decriminalize distribution of drug paraphernalia sits on Governor Tina Kotek&rsquo;s desk awaiting signature before going into law, the New York Post reported.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The winner of Miss Netherlands 2023 is a man</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender activism marches on. The newly crowned Miss Universe Netherlands is a man. The runner-up is a woman.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rikkie Valerie Koll&eacute; was crowned Miss Universe Netherlands 2023 on Saturday. Rikkie is 22 years old, a Dutch-Moluccan model and actress in Leusden. He will represent the Netherlands at the 2023 Miss Universe pageant in El Salvador. The first runner-up is Nathalie Mogbelzada, 26, from Amsterdam.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reigning Miss Universe, R&rsquo;Bonney Gabriel of Houston, Texas, was a special guest at the pageant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He makes history as the first transgender woman to win the national title. In 2018, Angele Ponce, Miss Universe Spain, was the first transgender to participate in the Miss Universe pageant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of having a transgender competitor in the Miss Universe pageant goes back to 2012. That is when Trump owned it and he overturned a decision by the Miss Universe organization to disqualify a Canadian model. Jenna Talackova was not being allowed to compete because &ldquo;she was not a naturally born female.&rdquo; Trump bowed to the laws of Canada and allowed Jenna to compete. The LGBTQ community applauded Trump. Now he&rsquo;s running against a very socially conservative Republican, Ron DeSantis, among others, and Trump has flipped on the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Miss America pageant is also having its share of problems. Ever since former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson came out as super woke and joined the organization, internal battles have leaked into the press. One big issue is that when Carlson joined the organization in 2018, she made the decision to ban the swimsuit segment. Now a former Miss America, Caressa Cameron, says that the pageant feels like a Ted Talk. There is a new docuseries on A&amp;E that exposes scandals, misogyny, and racism in the Miss America competitions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>US CENTCOM says it killed ISIS leader in Syria airstrike, no civilian casualties</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. forces killed ISIS leader Usamah al-Muhajir in an airstrike in eastern Syria on Friday, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) announced in a Sunday statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al-Muhajir was killed by the same MQ-9 reaper drones that had been harassed by Russian aircraft in the region. The two incidents occurred the same day, the U.S. says, with the drones carrying out the strike after the interaction with Russian craft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have made it clear that we remain committed to the defeat of ISIS throughout the region," said CENTCOM commander Gen. Michael Kurilla. "ISIS remains a threat, not only to the region but well beyond."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CENTCOM clarified that there were no indications that any civilians were killed in the strike, but the U.S. and allies were assessing reports of a civilian injury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and allied forces in the region have carried out a consistent campaign against remaining ISIS leaders operating in Syria. The U.S. killed the head of the organization, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a 2019 raid. Since then, ISIS forces have operated as cells.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MQ-9 drones used in the attack had earlier interactions with Russian SU-35 fighter jets throughout last week. The Russian craft have repeatedly flown into the path of the drones, forcing them to take evasive action to avoid a collision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Russian military aircraft engaged in unsafe and unprofessional behavior Thursday, 9:30 a.m. local time, while interacting with U.S. MQ-9 drones carrying out our D-ISIS mission in Syria," said Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, commander, 9th AF and CFACC for CENTCOM. "Russian aircraft dropped flares in front of the drones and flew dangerously close, endangering the safety of all aircraft involved."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is the second instance of dangerous behaviors by Russian pilots within the past 24 hours, with the first happening Wednesday at approximately 10:40 a.m. local time," he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military has also urged Russian forces in Syria to "cease this reckless behavior and adhere to the standards of behavior expected of a professional air force, so we can resume our focus on the enduring defeat of ISIS," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. maintains a force of about 900 troops deployed in Syria. They primarily work with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in their struggle against Islamic State militants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in entertainment&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/cnn-discourages-viewers-from-watching-anti-pedophile-movie-sound-of-freedom?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/cnn-discourages-viewers-from-watching-anti-pedophile-movie-sound-of-freedom?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CNN discourages viewers from watching anti-pedophile movie, Sound of Freedom</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a clip from CNN, network host Abby Phillip brought on an author named Mike Rothschild to talk about the new and popular anti-child sex trafficking film, Sound of Freedom. Rothschild charged the film is created out of a "moral panic" and "QAnon concepts."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound of Freedom is based on the adventures of Tim Ballard, who started an organization known as Operation Underground Railroad (OUR). OUR's mission is to save children from human trafficking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rothschild wrote a book titled, "The Storm is Upon Us," which details many QAnon conspiracy theories such as the idea that the Democratic Party elites are part of a cabal of Satanic worshippers that drink the blood of children.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rothschild targeted said the film is "being marketed to either specific QAnon believers or to people who believe all of the same tenets as QAnon, but claim they don't know what it is."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v2yw470-cnn-encourages-viewers-not-to-see-anti-pedophile-movie-sound-of-freedom.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v2yw470-cnn-encourages-viewers-not-to-see-anti-pedophile-movie-sound-of-freedom.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN has had its own problems with employees being involved in child sex crimes. One former producer at the network, John Griffin, was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Griffin coerced a woman online to bring her nine-year-old daughter to Vermont to engage in illicit acts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story depicted in the film is of Ballard, played by Caviezel, rescuing children. After much strife with working in the US government, he bumps up against bureaucracy in his position as an agent. He had to quit his job to rescue the kids in the film and did so in reality as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the beginning of OUR as a non-government organization. The movie focuses on Ballard's mission to save the two children and reunite a family torn apart by child sex trafficking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the movie, Caviezel appears on screen with a special message to share and urges people to "pay it forward" and donate to allow others to see the film.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caviezel says, "Steve Jobs once said, 'The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller.' Abraham Lincoln credited Harriet Stowe when she wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin. This powerful story inspired millions to rise up and fight against slavery. I think we can make Sound of Freedom the Uncle Tom's Cabin of modern-day slavery."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Sound of Freedom is a hero's tale, but I'm not talking about the character I play. It's the heroic brother and sister in this film that work to save each other."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caviezel added, "Together, we have a chance to make these two kids, and the countless children that they represent, the most powerful people in the world by telling their story in a way only the cinema can do."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we wrap up today&rsquo;s show, let&rsquo;s talk about on this day in history!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this day in history, July 11th:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">138 Antoninus Pius succeeds Hadrian as Emperor of Rome</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1405 Chinese fleet commander Zheng He sets sail on his first major expedition, to the Spice Islands, leading 208 vessels, including 62 treasure ships with 27,800 sailors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1533 Pope Clement VII excommunicates England's King Henry VIII</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 11th July 1533, the Pope declared that Henry VIII&rsquo;s marriage to Anne Boleyn was null and void, as was the annulment declared by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in May 1533, and he restored Catherine of Aragon to her &ldquo;royal state&rdquo;. He ordered the wayward king to abandon the newly crowned and pregnant Anne Boleyn and return to Catherine of Aragon. If the king refused then the Pope would issue the bull of excommunication that he had drawn up. He&rsquo;d give Henry until September to sort himself out, but if he didn&rsquo;t heed the Pope&rsquo;s warning then he&rsquo;d be excommunicated, the most severe punishment that the Church could inflict.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Henry took absolutely no notice of the Pope, but he escaped excommunication until 17th December 1538 when Pope Paul III excommunicated him following his break with Rome, his persecution of those who did not accept his supremacy, the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry&rsquo;s desecration of religious shrines including that of Thomas Becket.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the age of 30, the remarkable Thomas Hutchins (1730?-1789) was an experienced frontiersman, a veteran of the French and Indian War, and a skilled Indian agent. He was best known, however, as a formidable surveyor, cartographer, and geographer. A native of New Jersey, the particular combination of skills made Hutchins the perfect candidate for surveying the vast western regions of the British North American empire. In 1766, he was officially assigned to duty as an engineer in the British army, gradually becoming the most respected surveyor and map maker in the colonies. From 1764 through 1768, he took part in expeditions spanning the west from the northern reaches of the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans, and in 1770, was transferred from the Illinois territory to Pensacola, where he was charged with reorganizing the provincial defenses and mapping.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">We start today off with world news as Ukraine and Russia are playing a game of he did it - he did it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-russia-accuse-each-other-planning-imminent-attack-europes-largest-nuclear-plant"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-russia-accuse-each-other-planning-imminent-attack-europes-largest-nuclear-plant</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Ukraine, Russia accuse each other of planning imminent attack against Europe's largest nuclear plant</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of planning an imminent attack against one of the world's largest nuclear plants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a video address Tuesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alleged that information from Ukrainian intelligence officials shows the "Russian military has placed objects resembling explosives on the roof of several power units" of the Za-po-ree-zia Nuclear Power Plant &ndash; located in southeastern Ukraine and occupied by Russian troops.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The "foreign objects" were placed on the roof of the plant's third and fourth power units, according to a statement from the General Staff of Ukraine&rsquo;s armed forces. "Their detonation should not damage power units but may create a picture of shelling from Ukraine," the statement said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov raised the specter of a potentially "catastrophic" provocation by the Ukrainian army at the nuclear plant, which is Europe&rsquo;s largest but has its six reactors shut down. It still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Over the last year, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog repeatedly expressed alarm over the possibility of a radiation catastrophe like the one at Chernobyl, where a reactor exploded in 1986.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While Russia and Ukraine regularly traded blame over shelling near the plant that caused power outages, Ukraine has alleged more recently that Moscow might try to cause a deliberate leak in an attempt to derail Kyiv&rsquo;s ongoing counteroffensive in the surrounding Za-po-ree-zia region.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Moscow, meanwhile, had accused the Ukrainians of "deliberate sabotage" of the Ka-hove-ka hydroelectric power plant, claiming Kyiv was "pursuing the goal of depriving Crimea of water."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The International Atomic Energy Agency has officials stationed at the Russian-held plant, which is still run by its Ukrainian staff. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said his agency's most recent inspection of the plant found no mining activities, "but we remain extremely alert."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">We now go to California.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/california-bills-keep-pride-marching-long-past-june"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/california-bills-keep-pride-marching-long-past-june</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>California Bills Keep Pride Marching Long Past June</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The infernal provocation that is Pride Month might be over, but the marches continue through the legislature in California. They are here, they are queer, and they are coming for your children &mdash; legally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Multiple bills at various stages in the California legislative process proclaim who ultimately has authority of your kids, and it&rsquo;s not you. Some have understandably garnered much media attention, but SB 407 is working its way through the Assembly without much fanfare or discussion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">SB 407 would require all potential foster families to demonstrate their capacity and willingness to facilitate pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for &ldquo;gender-expansive&rdquo; children. Even if the child seems to give no indication of such inclinations at the time, the resource family must be assessed with the understanding that need for such care could arise at any stage of development.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sen. Scott Weiner (D-San Francisco) in introducing the bill, claimed it would protect children from being placed in &ldquo;hostile foster homes.&rdquo; Hostile homes are the homes of any foster families who are unwilling to commit to actively supporting gender transition interventions for minors. SB 407 effectively institutionalizes a prohibition against orthodox Christians as well as other religious believers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It effectively prohibits foster parents who think it unwise to allow the mutilation of perfectly healthy body parts on minors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Current and historic data give us insight into the demographics of those most prone to foster non-related babies and minors. Barna Group&rsquo;s research shows that Christians engage in adoption, foster care, and other ways of aiding vulnerable children more than the average. &ldquo;Practicing Christians (5%) are more than twice as likely to adopt than the general population (2%). Catholics are three times as likely. And evangelicals are five times as likely to adopt as the average adult.&rdquo; Practicing Christians are also nearly three times more likely to have seriously considered foster care, and 65% of non-kin foster parents attend religious services weekly &mdash; compared to 39%for the general population.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In any just world such families willing to stretch themselves to help kids would be sought after, not precluded from the foster system. However, the only families fit to foster, according to the supporters of this bill, are those who give full assent to the most radical tenets of gender theory. What is obvious to most everyone (except the bill&rsquo;s authors) is that such ideological assent signals a willingness to reject sexual boundaries. It is that rejection that makes sexual chaos far more likely in the home, not less. Is that the goal? If minors can consent to invasive transitioning interventions, what can they not consent to?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">There is also the reality that SB407 is hardly the only bill in California attacking parental rights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">SB 107, passed and was signed into law in September of last year, allowing minors to be brought to the Golden State against the will of a parent if it is for the sake of seeking gender transitioning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In-state parents are not really calling any shots either, according to AB 957&nbsp; which puts parental custody in jeopardy absent the guardian&rsquo;s support of their child&rsquo;s &ldquo;gender identity.&rdquo; Absent full support, which is not defined in the bill, a parent can be charged by a court with child abuse. The age at which the child&rsquo;s desires to begin transitioning must be accommodated is not mentioned, but the bill&rsquo;s author, Assemblywoman Lori Wilson (D-Suisun City) used an example of a seven-year old in arguing the merits of this bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Now this is the author of the article talking here:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At a recent speaking event I attended for the Awake Americans launch, some protestors carried a sign that read, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t co-parent with hate groups.&rdquo; Bemused, a few of us commented that obviously we don&rsquo;t want them to co-parent with us either, so&hellip;no problem. But their meaning was more sinister. It was not that they would not co-parent our kids with us, it was that we are unfit to co-parent our own kids with them. They see our kids as theirs to parent and ours to lose.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biden said as much out loud recently, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such things as someone else&rsquo;s child. Our nation&rsquo;s children are all our children.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no such thing as someone else&rsquo;s child. In no situation do normal people act as though that were true. I do not decide when to speak to other people&rsquo;s children about sex, nor take them home with me at will. I don&rsquo;t even know their food allergies much less make pivotal decisions for them. Someone could dismiss Biden&rsquo;s words as an empty platitude or incoherent ramblings except that they reflect a real perspective that is incrementally creeping into policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/governor-vetoes-bipartisan-bill-protecting-womens-sports"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/governor-vetoes-bipartisan-bill-protecting-womens-sports</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Governor Vetoes Bipartisan Bill Protecting Women&rsquo;s Sports</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper vetoed a bipartisan bill that would protect women&rsquo;s sports on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 574, which is titled the &ldquo;Fairness in Women&rsquo;s Sports Act&rdquo; and passed with bipartisan supermajorities, would prohibit men from playing in women&rsquo;s sports in middle schools, high schools, and universities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need politicians inflaming their political culture wars by making broad, uninformed decisions about an extremely small number of vulnerable children that are already handled by a robust system that relies on parents, schools and sports organizations,&rdquo; the Democratic governor stated. &ldquo;Republican governors in other states have vetoed similar bills because they hurt their states&rsquo; reputation and economy and because they are neither fair nor needed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Fairness in Women&rsquo;s Sports Act was passed with the support of two Democrats in the state legislature &mdash; Rep. Michael Wray in the House, and Sen. Val Applewhite in the Senate. If Cooper&rsquo;s veto is overridden, the bill would apply to all public schools and any private school that competes against public schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Applewhite said that her vote was &ldquo;a tough decision to make&rdquo; and was based on conversations with coaches and other constituents in her district. One umpire told the Democrat that changes in strength levels between boys and girls can start as soon as seven years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the Fayetteville Observer, Applewhite received &ldquo;bad threats&rdquo; after her vote. When approached by The News &amp; Observer, Wray declined to comment on why he supported the bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Cooper also vetoed SB 49, named the &ldquo;Parents&rsquo; Bill of Rights,&rdquo; and HB 808, which would ban sex change treatments for minors. Unlike the women&rsquo;s sports bill, these two bills passed with no Democratic support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Cooper&rsquo;s vetoes of HB 574 and HB 808 are likely to be overridden by the North Carolina General Assembly, since the GOP holds supermajorities in both houses, thanks in part to Rep. Tricia Cotham, who switched parties from Democrat to Republican in April and voted for all three bills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, the path forward for the Parents&rsquo; Bill of Rights is less certain, since one Republican, Rep. Hugh Blackwell, voted against the bill, leaving Republicans one vote short of overriding the governor&rsquo;s veto on that bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Cooper is not the only Democratic governor to veto bipartisan bills surrounding protecting womens&rsquo; sports, banning sex change treatments for minors, and strengthening parental rights in education.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana vetoed three similar bills Friday, all of which saw multiple Democrats join Republicans to support them in the state legislature. In a press conference, Edwards compared the bills&rsquo; supporters to segregationists during the Civil Rights Movement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">We now go to Phoenix&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/phoenix-city-council-votes-to-send-unclaimed-firearms-to-national-police-of-ukraine?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/phoenix-city-council-votes-to-send-unclaimed-firearms-to-national-police-of-ukraine?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Phoenix City Council votes to send 'unclaimed' firearms to National Police of Ukraine</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Phoenix City Council passed a vote last week that allows up to 600 unclaimed guns from Phoenix to be donated to the National Police of Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The plan is going through a contract with a company, DT Gruelle, that is specially approved for overseas arms trading. Around $200,000 worth of firearms will be handed over to the company for shipment, according to the Arizona Daily Independent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under Arizona City law, unclaimed arms need to be resold within one year after they have been obtained by the city. The arms are disposed of or sold "to any business that is authorized to receive and dispose of the article under federal and state law."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the June 28 City Council report, the city "selected approximately 500-600 unclaimed firearms to transfer through Gruelle, a private company which provides export and import services." The plan passed with unanimous support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The report stated that "firearms are unclaimed when there has been no owner contact after a thirty day notice, in which case the City can dispose of them." The Phoenix Police Department states that the firearms are "lost, unclaimed, or found in possession of the Phoenix Police Department." KJZZ said of unclaimed firearms, "essentially they end up in the police department&rsquo;s lost and found"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Only 9mm, 45mm, 39mm and 12 gauge firearms will be sent," according to the notes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The council promoted the "two year" contract with the private company and, according to the meeting notes, no taxpayer money will be "expended by the City."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, questions about the transfer of arms have been raised. The law in Arizona states that firearms that are authorized to be sold by the city need to be sold "to the public" by the business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The company's website says, "We have a breadth of experience due to 40 years of continuous support to the United States and over 150 other countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Ukraine."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We comply with all required procedures which permeate through our ongoing operations," it goes on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The company has a history of working in Ukraine. In April of 2022 last year, a report showed that a township in Pennsylvania worked with DT Gruelle to raise funds for the Ukrainian war effort, according to the Tribune-Democrat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now this! Is it time to boycott Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ben-jerry-boycott-calls-july-4th-message-1810991"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsweek.com/ben-jerry-boycott-calls-july-4th-message-1810991</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Ben &amp; Jerry's Faces Boycott Calls Over 4th of July Message</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ben &amp; Jerry's is facing a boycott after calling on the United States to "commit to returning" stolen Indigenous land in its 4th of July message.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Independence Day, the iconic American ice cream brand sparked outrage on social media by publishing a Twitter post with an image reading: "The United States was founded on stolen Indigenous land. This Fourth of July, let's commit to returning it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the caption, the company added: "It's high time we recognize that the US exists on stolen Indigenous land and commit to returning it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ben &amp; Jerry's message generated a flood of negative responses on social media, with some calling it the company's "Bud Light moment," referring to controversy and subsequent boycott after the beer brand partnered with a transgender activist in April.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Other Twitter users called on the company to be the first to give up its profits and properties, including factories, buildings and stores. Others said that the company should be returning its factory land to the Abenaki people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Ok you start. Relinquish your headquarters," one Twitter user wrote. "This should be easy then," wrote another. "Shut down and donate all of your land, facilities, and assets to indigenous people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Others accused the company of virtue-signaling&mdash;the practice of expressing opinions or sentiments intended to demonstrate one's good character, social conscience and awareness of a certain issue, just for the sake of appearing good in people's eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Scrutiny has continued to escalate over the company's support of the LGBTQ+ community and the Black Lives Matter movement, among other polarizing issues.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/potential-prisoner-swap-deal-in-the-works-for-wall-street-journal-writer-detained-in-russia-report?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/potential-prisoner-swap-deal-in-the-works-for-wall-street-journal-writer-detained-in-russia-report?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Potential prisoner swap deal in the works for Wall Street Journal writer detained in Russia</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian and American officials are reportedly discussing a prisoner swap that could include detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, however, no further details have been released by either side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gershkovich has been held in Moscow&rsquo;s Lefortovo pre-trial detention centre for months after being arrested and charged with "espionage." Previous attempts to free him via the Russian legal system have come up fruitless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Washington Post, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov explained on Tuesday that officials "don't want [the details] discussed in public," adding that prisoner swap negotiations "must be carried out and continue in complete silence."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Russian government has appeared willing to swap US-held prisoners for Gershkovich, however, Deputy Foreign Minister said earlier this year that talks would only begin after the journalist's trial had ended.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gershkovich and the US have tried to hasten proceedings, but it has been to no avail. Last week, a Russian court determined that he had to remain in pre-trial detention at Lefortovo until August 30.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, US Ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, met with Gershkovich and noted that he "is in good health and remains resilient despite the circumstances." She expressed hope that the Russian government would "provide regular consular access."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Wall Street Journal reports, White House officials stated on Tuesday, "While we unfortunately do not have a breakthrough to share, we continue to pursue every avenue to secure the release of Evan Gershkovich."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US government, including Ambassador Tracy, has maintained Gershkovich's innocence and slammed the Russian government over his treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The accusations against Gershkovich are unfounded," she said, "and we call on the Russian authorities to release the journalist immediately."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal also stood with Gershkovich, stating,"Evan is a member of the free press who right up until he was arrested was engaged in news-gathering. Any suggestions otherwise are false."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first US journalist to be detained in Russia on charges of spying since the Cold War, Gershkovich could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this! Another whoopsie from the government!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/accountability/waste-fraud-and-abuse/usda-says-it-overpaid-10-food-stamp-benefits-2022-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/accountability/waste-fraud-and-abuse/usda-says-it-overpaid-10-food-stamp-benefits-2022-program</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>USDA says it overpaid 10% of food stamp benefits in 2022 as program doubled from 2019</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Largely due to unintentional mistakes" by the government or households, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it overpaid Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in 10% of cases, The Washington Times reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government either wrongly determined households were eligible for the program better known as food stamps or overestimated how much they were due, while 2% were deemed underpayments. The total rate of under- and overpayments was lower before the COVID-19 pandemic: 7.4% in 2019 and 6.8% in 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States varied widely in how accurate their payments were, with Alaska the worst at overpayment with 57% and South Dakota the best at under 3%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program has also doubled since 2019, reaching $113.9 billion from $55.6 billion. It now covers 41 million Americans with an average payment of $230 per month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government Accountability Office also released figures Friday of overpayment across the federal government in fiscal 2022, $247 billion, while cautioning the figure is an estimate because the government cannot "determine the full extent to which improper payments occur."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now to Los Angeles we go&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/los-angeles-homeless-population-spikes-to-more-than-46000?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/los-angeles-homeless-population-spikes-to-more-than-46000?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Los Angeles County homeless population spikes to over 75,000</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homelessness has increased by ten percent in the city of Los Angeles, and it has increased in Los Angeles County by nine percent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the 2023 Greater Los Angeles homeless count results conducted by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), Los Angeles County&rsquo;s homeless population increased to approximately 75,518, an increase from 69,144 in 2022. In the City of Angels, the number of homeless people increased to approximately 46,260 people, an increase from 41,980 people in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, it was revealed that California holds half of all &ldquo;unsheltered people&rdquo; in the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Va Lecia Adams Kellum, chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, said, &ldquo;The homeless count results tell us what we already know, that we have a crisis on our streets, and it&rsquo;s getting worse.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Janice Hahn called the results &ldquo;disappointing,&rdquo; writing in a statement, &ldquo;It is frustrating to have more people fall into homelessness even as we are investing hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and resources into efforts to bring people inside. I appreciate the cities that have stepped up and supported solutions, but these numbers prove that solutions-oriented cities are too few and far between.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles officials challenged the accuracy of the 2022 LAHSA count that reported finding zero homeless people in Venice Beach, an area known for its massive homeless problem. As a result, the county used a new counting app and hired a demographer and two data scientists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Democratic Mayor Karen Bass has claimed at least 14,000 homeless people have been moved into interim or permanent housing under her administration, it was revealed earlier this year that the city was spending over $800,000 per housing unit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority made a point of emphasizing that Los Angeles is not the only major US city to see an increase in its homeless population, noting that Chicago saw a 57 percent increase and Portland saw a 20 percent hike. According to the agency, in California, Kern County saw a 22 percent increase, San Bernardino County a 26 percent increase, San Diego County a 22 percent increase, and Riverside County a 12 percent increase.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, San Diego and Portland approved homeless camping bans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on&hellip; Do you guys remember that Children&rsquo;s hospital in Boston that was exposed for performing gender mutilation &amp; sterilazation on kids?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/miacathell/2023/07/04/boston-childrens-hospital-dethroned-n2624870"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/miacathell/2023/07/04/boston-childrens-hospital-dethroned-n2624870</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children's Hospital Caught Trans-ing Kids No Longer No. 1 for Pediatric Care</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in a decade, Boston's Children's Hospital&mdash;which was exposed last year for its experimental genital mutilation, sterilization, and chemical castration of minors identifying&nbsp; &nbsp; as "transgender"&mdash;is no longer the no. 1 pediatric medical center in America.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2014, Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital has claimed the top spot on U.S. News and World Report's honor roll rating the best pediatric-care facilities in the nation. But, the consumer-ranking giant's 2023 - 2024 list published on June 21 has dethroned the Beantown-based institution, the leading recipient of pediatric-research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest rankings, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center took the crown, with Boston Children's Hospital bumped to second place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. News and World Report collected data from almost 200 medical centers through an annual survey that examines a myriad of criteria, such as patient safety, clinical outcomes, and surgical success. Each hospital's score was derived from a nationwide polling of 15,000-plus pediatric specialists, who were asked "where they would send the sickest children in their specialty."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among its LGBTQ-centered departments, Boston Children's Hospital is home to the Gender Multispecialty Service (GeMS) clinic, the "first pediatric and adolescent transgender health program" in the U.S. Serving more than 1,000 families to date, GeMS has expanded to "treat" patients as young as three-years-old. The hospital's Center for Gender Surgery offers surgical mutilation to gender-dysphoric teenagers, including vaginoplasties for 17-year-old boys (Boston Children's Hospital has since quietly changed the age minimum); metoidioplasties and phalloplasties; and chest reconstruction and breast augmentation for 15-year-old kids.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the age range has been raised to 18-years-old in the hospital's official guidance. Removal of the testicles is often performed at the same time as a vaginoplasty, which requires a lifetime of dilation,, and can leave the patient sterile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Children's Hospital, whose tagline is: "Until every child is well," was caught promoting "gender-affirming hysterectomies" for "trans youth" in a now-scrubbed video, which was part of a 90-part series that positively frames the medical butchery without addressing the irreversible damage that it does to the human body. Other topics highlighted in the series include "Why is hair removal necessary before phalloplasty?" and "Fertility preservation: What transgender patients should know."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salvaged by Libs of TikTok, an archived version of the 33-second hysterectomy footage shows a smiling Dr. Frances Grimstad of Boston Children's Hospital Division of Gynecology happily describing, as upbeat background music played, the medically unnecessary operation that can render (otherwise) physically healthy patients infertile by removing female reproductive organs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another since-deleted video posted to the hospital's YouTube channel showed a psychologist claiming that "a good portion" of children she sees at Boston Children's Hospital GeMS clinic know they're transgender "from the womb.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1649007304774123521"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1649007304774123521</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Journal of the American Medical Association article that Boston Children's Hospital GeMS co-director Dr. Oren Ganor authored on "Streamlining Interstate Access to Gender-Affirming Surgeries," the plastic and reconstructive surgeon called for a drastic increase in "clinician capacity" for children to be subjected to "sex-change" surgeries. Ganor also urged a ramping up of "training efforts" at medical school residency programs to instruct future physicians on performing "transgender" procedures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The local NPR news station WBUR reported in 2018 that Ganor wrote in an email that Boston Children's Hospital is "slightly flexible" when it comes to the age acceptance of biological males seeking genital surgery "because of the difficulty young women can experience accessing gendered spaces&mdash;like dorms and bathrooms&mdash;if they still have male genitalia." The hospital's policy had not yet been finalized, Ganor said, "because of the issue around consent for sterilization (which is part of the procedure)."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in entertainment news&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/07/03/after-the-walt-disney-company-canned-chief-diversity-officer-latondra-newton-warner-bros-discovery-and-netflix-lose-their-diversity-heads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/07/03/after-the-walt-disney-company-canned-chief-diversity-officer-latondra-newton-warner-bros-discovery-and-netflix-lose-their-diversity-heads/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>After The Walt Disney Company Canned Chief Diversity Officer Latondra Newton, Warner Bros. Discovery And Netflix Lose Their Diversity Heads</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of June it was revealed that The Walt Disney Company&rsquo;s Chief Diversity Officer Latondra Newton was no longer with the company. Now Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix&rsquo;s have also seen their diversity heads leave their respective companies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Variety announced Newton had left The Walt Disney Company after they obtained an internal company memo on June 20th from the company&rsquo;s HR chief Sonia Coleman.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coleman wrote in the memo, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing to share the news that Latondra Newton has decided to leave The Walt Disney Company to pursue other endeavors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coleman went on to reveal that Julie Merges would take on Newton&rsquo;s role on an interim basis as the company looked for a new DEI leader, &ldquo;Latondra&rsquo;s direct reports will report to Julie Merges on an interim basis until a new DEI leader is identified. I want to thank Julie for leading this team along with her Talent Acquisition organization.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Additionally, Shelby Curry and the DEI Internal Communications team will continue reporting to Carrie Brown in her role leading internal communications &amp; engagement for the company,&rdquo; Coleman wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Newton&rsquo;s exit, TheWrap reported that Netflix&rsquo;s head of inclusion strategy VernÄ Myers was stepping down from her position at the company in September. While she is exiting the company as head of inclusion strategy she will still advise the company albeit the report notes she will be focusing primarily on her consulting company, The VernÄ Myers Company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike The Walt Disney Company, Netflix appears to have a replacement for Myers already lined up in Wade Davis. Davis is currently the Vice President of Inclusion Strategy and worked under Myers for four years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Myers said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to step away from the company and this role because of how much I love Netflix and the people here. I&rsquo;m so excited for the talented Wade Davis who will be taking the lead of the I-and-D work along with our incredible inclusion strategy team and I can&rsquo;t wait to see the continued progress we all will make together.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of June, Los Angeles Times reported that Warner Bros. Discovery axed its diversity leader Karen Horne, who was the company&rsquo;s Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in North America.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the outlet&rsquo;s sources her departure from the company was announced on June 28th and the company&rsquo;s spokeswoman Megan Klein informed the outlet she was not let go due to Warner Bros. Discovery&rsquo;s &ldquo;cost-cutting but rather a rethinking and reorganization of the company&rsquo;s diversity organization.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Ezra Institute Fellow Andrew Sandlin discusses his book,&nbsp;<em>A Postmillennial Primer</em>. In this episode, Andrew and Joe Boot outline the biblical case for an optimistic eschatology and the historical and ideological events that led to this doctrine&rsquo;s present position as a minority perspective in evangelicalism. In dependence on the Holy Spirit and through an attentive reading of Scripture, Christians should expect that Christ will continue to establish His kingdom on earth and drive back sin, death, and the devil.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Ezra Institute Fellow Andrew Sandlin discusses his book,&nbsp;<em>A Postmillennial Primer</em>. In this episode, Andrew and Joe Boot outline the biblical case for an optimistic eschatology and the historical and ideological events that led to this doctrine&rsquo;s present position as a minority perspective in evangelicalism. In dependence on the Holy Spirit and through an attentive reading of Scripture, Christians should expect that Christ will continue to establish His kingdom on earth and drive back sin, death, and the devil.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-conscious-college-admissions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-conscious-college-admissions</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supreme Court bans affirmative action in ruling against race-conscious college admissions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court ruled to ban the consideration of race as part of admissions decisions at colleges, including Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, ending the decadeslong practice known as affirmative action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the six-member majority to undo the lasting impacts of the landmark 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which upheld race-conscious admissions at universities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Harvard&rsquo;s and UNC&rsquo;s admissions programs violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," the majority held in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented and was joined by Justice Elena Kagan. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented in the UNC case, joined by Sotomayor and Kagan. Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case due to her past service on the university board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justices have been mulling since November over two cases brought by the nonprofit group Students for Fair Admissions, headed by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum, a staunch critic of affirmative action policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority held that "nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise. But, despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justice Clarence Thomas added that he would "highly doubt" universities could carry on with considering race in admissions policies with the new test that was established Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In the future, universities wishing to discriminate based on race in admissions must articulate and justify a compelling and measurable state interest based on concrete evidence. Given the strictures set out by the Court, I highly doubt any will be able to do so."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During oral arguments in October 2022, the court's inclination to ban affirmative action was evident. The court's six conservatives expressed skepticism toward the practice, even as attorneys for Harvard and UNC, along with U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, implored the court to permit the practice to continue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another case filed in 2014 alleged the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill unlawfully discriminates against white and Asian American applicants. That suit accused the university of violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment promise of equal protection under the law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banning the use of affirmative action will force elite colleges to reinvent their policies and find new ways to ensure diversity in their student populations without using race as a consideration. Several universities have expressed concerns in legal briefs that a decision to overturn affirmative action could result in fewer minority students on campuses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But ahead of the high court's opinion release, legal experts speculated colleges might attempt to maintain a superficial vision for diversity on campus without taking race into consideration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The matter of race-neutral admissions policies that are implemented for racially conscious ends could find its way to the Supreme Court soon. A group of parents, alumni, and community members at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax, Virginia, sued the school for changing its admissions process to increase the number of black and brown students and decrease the number of Asian students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the school's new process did not violate federal law. The case's next stop would be the Supreme Court.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1185087587/google-says-it-will-start-blocking-canadian-news-stories-in-response-to-new-law"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1185087587/google-says-it-will-start-blocking-canadian-news-stories-in-response-to-new-law</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google says it will start blocking Canadian news stories in response to new law</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google said on Thursday that it will block all links to Canadian news articles for people using its search engine and other services in the country in response to a new law that would compel tech companies to pay publishers for content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes a week after Meta vowed its own blackout of Canadian publishers on Facebook and Instagram, calling the law "fundamentally flawed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two tech giants have been battling the Canadian government over the law that would force them to negotiate compensation deals with news organizations for distributing links to news stories.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law, called the Online News Act, passed last week. But it could take months for it to take effect. Once it does, Google and Meta say they will start removing news articles by Canadian publishers from their services in the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters of the legislation have argued that it could provide a much-needed lifeline to the ailing news industry, which has been gutted by Silicon Valley's ironclad control of digital advertising.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the law, platforms like Meta and Google would have to come to the negotiating table with news organizations and hammer out compensation deals. Government estimates predict that the law would result in a cash injection of some $329 million into the Canadian news industry, which has been beset by news staff layoffs and other downsizing in recent years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada's law was modeled on a similar effort in Australia, where Meta did block news articles for nearly a week before tense negotiations led Meta and Google to eventually strike deals with news publishers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill to force tech companies to pay publishers is also advancing in California, where the tech industry has levied similar blackout threats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Canada, both tech platforms have long been against the law, saying the companies are already helping news companies by directing web traffic to their sites. On Facebook and Instagram, news represents a tiny fraction &mdash; on Facebook, it's about 3% &mdash; of what people see every day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, too, does not consider news articles as essential to its service. So both companies have wagered that it is simply easier to block links to news articles than to start paying news organizations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most major publishers in Canada back the new law, outside media observers have not been so sure. Tech writer Casey Newton has argued that a tax on displaying links would "effectively break the internet" if it was applied to the rest of the web. Other critics have pointed to the lack of transparency over who actually would receive cash infusion from the tech companies. Some fear the programs could be hijacked by disinformation sites that learn how to game the system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet press advocates insisted that tech companies retaliating by threatening to systemically remove news articles will be a blow to civil society and the public's understanding of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At a moment when disinformation swirls in our public discourse, ensuring public access to credible journalism is essential, so it's deeply disappointing to see this decision from Google and Meta," said Liz Woolery, who leads digital policy at PEN America, an organization that supports freedom of expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woolery continued: "As policymakers explore potential solutions to the challenges facing the journalism industry, platforms are free to critique, debate, and offer alternatives, but reducing the public's access to news is never the right answer."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan tracks pair of Russian warships off island&rsquo;s eastern coast</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan scrambled aircraft and dispatched ships late Tuesday to monitor the passage of two Russian warships off its eastern coast, according to the island&rsquo;s Ministry of National Defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Russian frigates traveled northward along the coast toward the East China Sea around 11 p.m. Tuesday, the ministry said in a news release Tuesday. It did not specify how far offshore the ships were.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Taiwan&rsquo;s military used &ldquo;joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance methods&rdquo; and &ldquo;dispatched mission aircraft, ships and shore-mounted missile systems to closely monitor&rdquo; the Russian vessels, according to the release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ships continued on course and left Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;response area&rdquo; southeast of Suao, a city on the island&rsquo;s northeastern edge that is also home to a logistics support naval base, according to the Defense Ministry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Taiwan reports near-daily activity from the Chinese military off its western coast in the Taiwan Strait &mdash; 49 Chinese aircraft and 20 ships have been reported in the waterway since Sunday &mdash; Russian activity is less common.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warships&rsquo; passage comes less than a week after the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary outfit, organized a brief, two-day rebellion against the Russian government that began Friday with the group taking over military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don and concluded Saturday after they stood down and withdrew from the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also comes just over a week after Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing to meet with high-level Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, which Blinken described as &ldquo;candid and constructive&rdquo; but failed to secure the United States&rsquo; top priority of renewed communication between the two countries&rsquo; militaries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beijing considers Taiwan, a functionally independent democracy, to be a breakaway province and aims to reunite it with the mainland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China and Russia remain close allies, with the two countries regularly coordinating military exercises together, although Beijing has not openly endorsed Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Severe weather, FAA shortfalls kick off rocky start to summer air travel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flight disruptions mounted Tuesday as severe storms and staffing issues kicked off a rocky start to summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 7,700 flights were delayed Tuesday and nearly 2,200 were canceled, FlightAware data showed, as thunderstorms that derailed thousands of trips over the weekend lingered in airspace that is heavily congested on a clear-weather day. That&rsquo;s on top of more than 8,800 U.S. delays and close to 2,250 cancellations Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Aviation Administration paused flights bound for New York&rsquo;s LaGuardia Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. Delays were averaging three hours or longer at those airports. The FAA said that the thunderstorms were blocking arrival and departure routes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disruptions come ahead of the busy Fourth of July holiday travel period, when millions are expected to fly. The Transportation Security Administration said it could screen more travelers than in 2019, before the pandemic, raising competition for spare seats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has pressured airlines to improve their operations after widespread flight disruptions last spring and summer, which prompted carriers to trim their overambitious schedules. But the industry struggled to recover this past weekend from a series of thunderstorms that didn&rsquo;t let up for days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thunderstorms are difficult for airlines because they can form with less warning than other major weather obstacles like winter storms or hurricanes. Rolling delays could force crews to reach federally mandated workday limits and further worsen disruptions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 30,000 flights have arrived late since Saturday, FlightAware data showed, with cancellation rates from Saturday through Monday up more than three times the average for the year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some airline executives have also blamed some of the disruptions on shortages of air traffic controllers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told staff on Monday that &ldquo;the FAA frankly failed us this weekend.&rdquo; He said that during Saturday&rsquo;s storms the FAA reduced arrival rates by 40% and departures by 75% at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, one of the airline&rsquo;s biggest hubs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staffing challenges aren&rsquo;t new. The Covid-19 pandemic derailed hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, and the agency is now trying to catch up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General said in a report last week that air traffic control staffing shortfalls put air traffic operations at risk. In March, the FAA and some airlines agreed to reduce flights to help ease congestion at busy New York airports because of the staffing issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the problems persist at a time when airlines are readying crews and schedules for a busy summer season, fueled by sustained travel demand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the disruptions frustrated flight crews who were left waiting on hold for reassignments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents flight attendants at United and others said in a memo to members Monday that hold times for crew scheduling were longer than three hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the union&rsquo;s memo, United said it has &ldquo;deployed all available resources to catch up on call volume, including increasing staffing in crew scheduling and mandatory overtime on the scheduling team.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/over-200-billion-in-covid-relief-funds-lost-to-potential-fraud-and-abuse-gov-t-watchdog-finds-significantly-higher-than-previous-estimates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/over-200-billion-in-covid-relief-funds-lost-to-potential-fraud-and-abuse-gov-t-watchdog-finds-significantly-higher-than-previous-estimates</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Over $200 billion in COVID relief funds lost to potential fraud and abuse, gov't watchdog finds &mdash; significantly higher than previous estimates</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report released Tuesday from the Office of Inspector General of the Small Business Administration found that the federal government lost more than $200 billion in COVID relief funds to potential fraud, waste, and abuse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OIG's latest estimate is significantly higher than previous projections that speculated approximately $100 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relief initiatives included the Paycheck Protection and COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs, created to provide emergency financial relief to small businesses and those who lost their jobs due to restrictive lockdown measures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report estimated that at least 17% of the relief funds, which totaled approximately $1.2 trillion, were disbursed to potential fraudsters, including "more than $136 billion COVID-19 EIDLs and $64 billion in PPP funds."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspector General Hannibal "Mike" Ware noted that the OIG's investigation into the potentially stolen funds has, so far, resulted in 1,011 indictments, 803 arrests, and 529 convictions. Approximately $30 billion in fraudulently obtained relief funds have been seized and returned to the SBA.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ware previously predicted during a 2021 interview with ABC News, "In terms of the monetary value, the amount of fraud in these COVID relief programs is going to be larger than any government program that came before it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report claimed that the extensive fraud resulted from the SBA's "weakened or removed" controls to allow swift distribution of emergency funds to those in need.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OIG reported that the eased review process had the "allure of 'easy money'" for fraudsters who saw an opportunity to exploit the SBA's lowered barriers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OIG's report stated: "OIG is working on tens of thousands of investigative leads on alleged fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer resources. Thousands of investigations will ensue for years to come because of swift congressional action to increase the statute of limitations to 10 years for COVID-19 EIDL and PPP fraud. We continue to identify fraud schemes, and we anticipate the overall potential fraud estimate could fluctuate; therefore, we may issue periodic updates to this report.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey DeVries, acting associate administrator of the SBA, expressed concern that Ware's report contained "serious flaws that significantly overestimate fraud."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeVries stated that approximately 86% of the fraud occurred within the first nine months of the relief programs' rollouts, arguing that the agency's controls to prevent fraud improved over time.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutors reveal they have more footage of Jordan Neely&rsquo;s NYC subway chokehold death &mdash; as ex-Marine Daniel Penny enters not guilty plea</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors revealed Wednesday they have additional cellphone video from witnesses in Jordan Neely&rsquo;s subway chokehold death, as Marine Daniel Penny pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in the lightning-rod case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-year-old former infantry squad leader &mdash; who appeared in Manhattan Supreme Court clean-shaven and wearing a blue suit and maroon tie &mdash; was arraigned on charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide during the brief, minutes-long hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stoic Penny spoke only to say &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; as more than 50 people &mdash; including his supporters, backers of Neely, 30,&nbsp; and many members of the media &mdash; looked on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Island native was caught on bystander video putting Neely &mdash; who witnesses said had been threatening subway riders &mdash; into a chokehold on an F train on May 1. The medical examiner&rsquo;s office later ruled Neely&rsquo;s death a homicide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court documents filed Wednesday show that prosecutors have at least five cellphone videos from three witnesses to the deadly encounter that they plan to introduce as evidence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also have videotaped statements from two other witnesses, as well as two MTA surveillance videos and police body-worn camera footage, the document states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, prosecutors disclosed they have a videotaped statement that Penny made to cops the day of the incident &mdash; when they released him without charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny&rsquo;s statements to cops inside the Broadway-Lafayette Street station, as detailed in the filing, echo what he has said publicly about the incident since.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny described what could be seen in the shocking video of the confrontation, that Neely was &ldquo;rolling, he was rolling, when he was in a choke. He was going crazy,&rdquo; the filing states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny also told police that Neely was &ldquo;acting irate, dropping things on the floor, saying he doesn&rsquo;t care if he goes to jail,&rdquo; according to the court doc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny surrendered to authorities on May 12 after the Manhattan District Attorney&rsquo;s Office brought charges against him. He was indicted by a grand jury earlier this month and remains free on $100,000 bail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He faces up to 19 years behind bars if convicted on both counts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny has said he didn&rsquo;t mean to kill Neely, but that he felt he had to step in for the safety of other passengers as Neely &mdash; who had a long history of mental illness &mdash; had been throwing trash at riders and threatening them as they moved away from him.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/06/28/national-geographic-staff-writers-laid-off/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=wp_homepage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/06/28/national-geographic-staff-writers-laid-off/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=wp_homepage</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>National Geographic lays off its last remaining staff writers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like one of the endangered species whose impending extinction it has chronicled, National Geographic magazine has been on a relentlessly downward path, struggling for vibrancy in an increasingly unforgiving ecosystem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Washington-based magazine that has surveyed science and the natural world for 135 years reached another difficult passage when it laid off all of its last remaining staff writers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cutback &mdash; the latest in a series under owner Walt Disney Co. &mdash; involves some 19 editorial staffers in all, who were notified in April that these terminations were coming. Article assignments will henceforth be contracted out to freelancers or pieced together by editors. The cuts also eliminated the magazine&rsquo;s small audio department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Departing staffers said Wednesday the magazine has curtailed photo contracts that enabled photographers to spend months in the field producing the publication&rsquo;s iconic images.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a further cost-cutting move, copies of the famous bright-yellow-bordered print publication will no longer be sold on newsstands in the United States starting next year, the company said in an internal announcement last month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Geographic writer Craig Welch noted the moment in a tweet on Wednesday: &ldquo;My new National Geographic just arrived, which includes my latest feature &mdash; my 16th, and my last as a senior writer. &hellip; I&rsquo;ve been so lucky. I got to work w/incredible journalists and tell important, global stories. It&rsquo;s been an honor.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine&rsquo;s current trajectory has been years in the making, set in motion primarily by the epochal decline of print and ascent of digital news and information. In the light-speed world of digital media, National Geographic has remained an almost artisanal product &mdash; a monthly magazine whose photos, graphics and articles were sometimes the result of months of research and reporting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its peak in the late 1980s, National Geographic reached 12 million subscribers in the United States, and millions more overseas. Many of its devotees so savored its illumination of other worlds &mdash; space, the depths of the ocean, little-seen parts of the planet &mdash; that they stacked old issues into piles that cluttered attics and basements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains among the most widely read magazines in America, at a time when magazines are no longer widely read. At the end of 2022, it had just under 1.8 million subscribers, according to the authoritative Alliance for Audited Media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Geographic was launched by Washington&rsquo;s National Geographic Society, a foundation formed by 33 academics, scientists and would-be adventurers, including Alexander Graham Bell. The magazine was initially sold to the public as a perk for joining the society. It grew into a stand-alone publication slowly but steadily, reaching 1 million subscribers by the 1930s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine was eventually surpassed for profits and attention by the society&rsquo;s video operations, including its flagship National Geographic cable channel and Nat Geo Wild, a channel focused on animals. While they produced documentaries equal in quality to the magazine&rsquo;s rigorous reporting, the channels &mdash; managed by Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s 21st Century Fox &mdash; also aired pseudoscientific entertainment programming about UFOs and reality series like &ldquo;Sharks vs. Tunas&rdquo; at odds with the society&rsquo;s original high-minded vision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine&rsquo;s place of honor continued to dim through a series of corporate reshufflings that began in 2015 when the Society agreed to form a for-profit partnership with 21st Century Fox, which took majority control in exchange for $725 million. The partnership came under the Disney banner in 2019 as part of a massive $71 billion deal between Fox and Disney.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those who lost their jobs in the latest layoff was Debra Adams Simmons, who only last September was promoted to vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion at National Geographic Media, the entity that oversees the magazine and website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, David Miller, executive vice president of National Geographic Media, said the magazine was &ldquo;realigning key departments to help deepen engagement with our readers while also nurturing existing business models and developing new lines of revenue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email to The Post on Wednesday, National Geographic spokesperson Chris Albert said staffing changes will not affect the company&rsquo;s plans to continue publishing a monthly magazine &ldquo;but rather give us more flexibility to tell different stories and meet our audiences where they are across our many platforms.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/27/nyc-shelters-homeless-people-migrants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/27/nyc-shelters-homeless-people-migrants/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>NYC Is Housing More Illegal Migrants Than Homeless People</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The number of migrants in New York City&rsquo;s care has outpaced the homeless population in local shelters, according to NBC4 New York.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As of Sunday, the city had 50,000 migrants in its care, including in local hotels and temporary shelters, and 49,700 local homeless residents, NBC4 reported. The influx of migrants crossing the southern border illegally has led to more migrants arriving in the Big Apple, some of whom have been bused in by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The city has turned the historic Roosevelt Hotel, which closed three years ago, into a migrant shelter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;My heart breaks a little bit, and I have these conflicting feelings,&rdquo; Deputy Mayor Anne Williams-Isom said during a tour of the hotel, according to NBC4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams has floated asking his residents to help shelter migrants in their homes, he said in early June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It is my vision to take the next step to this, to go to the faith-based locales and then move to private residents, there are residents who are suffering right now because of economic challenges,&rdquo; Adams said at the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;They have spare rooms, they have locales and if we can find a way to get over the 30-day rule and other rules that government has in its place, we can take that $4.2 billion, $4.3 maybe now, that we potentially will have to spend, and we can put it back in the pockets of everyday New Yorkers, everyday houses of worship, instead of putting it in the pockets of corporations,&rdquo; Adams added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Adams has also taken matters into his own hands by busing some of the arriving migrants to New York suburbs, including an area near the northern border, where the Daily Caller News Foundation previously observed some of them crossing into Canada illegally. Adams has also transported dozens of migrants to Republican-run states, like Florida and Texas, South America and one to China, Politico reported Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Adams&rsquo; office didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/26/fox-news-fires-remaining-tucker-staffers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/26/fox-news-fires-remaining-tucker-staffers/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fox News Fires Remaining Tucker Staffers In Show&rsquo;s Final Stroke</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox News has fired the remaining staffers from Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s show as the network announces a new primetime lineup, Daily Caller confirmed Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The network let go of at least nine remaining staffers, including long-standing producers, in a move described as &ldquo;shockingly callous&rdquo; by one former Fox News producer who spoke to the Daily Caller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Some of the producers fired have been at Fox for well over a decade,&rdquo; the producer told the Daily Caller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Another former Fox producer told the Daily Caller that staffers on Carlson&rsquo;s team were repeatedly told following his departure that their jobs were safe, including as recently as last week when two of Carlson&rsquo;s producers left the network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The remaining staffers were told they could apply for any jobs throughout the company, the former producer told the Daily Caller, noting that employees who once staffed Bill O&rsquo;Reilly and Dan Bongino&rsquo;s show were simply reassigned on other shows after both hosts left the network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Staffers told the former producer the terminations were clearly an &ldquo;anti-Tucker move to purge any of his remaining stamp he had on the network as Fox begins this new lineup change.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The news comes after Fox News announced that Jesse Watters will replace Carlson in the 8:00 p.m. time slot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Watters, who originally started his career at the 8:00 p.m. time slot hosting a Man on the Street segment during Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s program, is slated to take over the hour, Fox News said in a press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Laura Ingraham will take over Watters&rsquo; 7:00 p.m. time slot while Greg Gutfeld will move his show to the 10:00 p.m. time slot. Sean Hannity will remain in his 9:00 p.m. slot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox announced in late April it was parting ways with Carlson just days after the network announced it was also parting ways with Dan Bongino. Carlson has since started hosting his own show on Twitter, prompting a public legal battle between Fox News and the Daily Caller co-founder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox News issued a &ldquo;cease and desist&rdquo; to Carlson in mid-June after accusing him of breaching his contract by violating its non-compete clause when he posted the first episode of his show on Twitter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Actor Julian Sands found dead in California after going missing on hike</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The San Bernardino County Sheriff's office has confirmed the death of Julian Sands after human remains were found on Southern California's Mount Baldy. He was 65 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He was hiking Mount Baldy when his family reported him missing on January 13, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sands had a wide and varied career but was best known for his role in the 1985 movie A Room with a View, starring opposite Helena Bonham Carter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sands learned acting at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. In A Room with a View, he played George Emerson, a love interest to the young upper-class Lucy Honeychurch, played by Carter. In 1986, he told NPR in an interview that he was well aware of the class dynamics at play in the movie. "Nobody's actually seen to do anything other than live some leisurely life which allows them to pursue their own indulgences," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sands' acting career brought him an eclectic array of roles. His film credits include Arachnophobia, Leaving Las Vegas, and the Jackie Chan movie The Medallion. On TV, he appeared in small roles on shows such as Castle, Smallville and Dexter. In Season 5 of the action drama 24, he played the main villain Vladimir Bierko, a terrorist in possession of a deadly nerve gas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He loved the outdoors. In a 2020 interview with The Guardian, he was asked when he was happiest. His answer was: "Close to a mountain summit on a glorious cold morning."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now in entertainment news&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/26/the-flash-collapses-in-its-second-weekend-at-the-box-office-with-massive-72-drop-analyst-predicts-film-will-lose-at-least-150-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/26/the-flash-collapses-in-its-second-weekend-at-the-box-office-with-massive-72-drop-analyst-predicts-film-will-lose-at-least-150-million/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>&lsquo;The Flash&rsquo; Collapses In Its Second Weekend At The Box Office With Massive 72% Drop, Analyst Predicts Film Will Lose At Least $150 Million</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ezra Miller&rsquo;s The Flash completely collapsed at the box office with an enormous 72% drop from its opening weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Flash had a long row to hoe after it&rsquo;s extremely poor opening weekend of $55 million at the domestic box office. And it does not look like it&rsquo;s going to be reaping anything but losses following its second weekend collapse of 72%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The-Numbers reports the film only grossed $15.2 million in its second weekend despite adding another 22 more theaters compared to its first weekend. The per theater gross declined from $13,000 in its opening weekend to $3,587 in its second weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The film&rsquo;s second weekend much like its first underperformed predictions. Box office tracking website Box Office Pro predicted the film would have a 69% drop and bring in $17.3 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The-Numbers predicted the film would only have a 59% decline and would bring in $22.5 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Comparing the film to other DCEU films, The Flash is one of the worst performing films as it stands right now. The only films it&rsquo;s outperformed at the worldwide box office are Birds of Prey, The Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman 1984, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Following this second weekend, box office analyst OMB Reviews predicts The Flash will only bring in a total gross between $300 million to $400 million worldwide in its entire theatrical run.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, he goes on to note, &ldquo;roughly between $300 and $350 million dollars if the film performs as a typical bad movie.&rdquo; That means it will likely stay in the same position it is on the DCEU list given Shazam! grossed $363.5 million and Black Adam brought in $391.2 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">OMB Reviews then points to the reported cost of the film being between $200 million and $220 million. He notes this means the film will likely lose around $150 million due to his estimated predictions that the film&rsquo;s total cost with marketing is approximately $330 million. Factoring in the film&rsquo;s split with theaters, he predicts the film&rsquo;s break even point is $550 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Thus if the film performs at the top of his estimates at $400 million, it would lose $150 million.</span></p>]]></description>
