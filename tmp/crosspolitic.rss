   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Liberty Dispatch</strong> ~ November 15, 2022</p>
<p class="p1">On this episode of Liberty Dispatch, hosts Andrew and Matty examine the week that was in their Week-in-Review, they recap the <em>Emergencies Act </em>Inquiry, and the Liberal's plan to increase Canadian immigration at the very time the country's institutions are failing.

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/dcd62fac-1af1-43ca-8bfa-9c4f8752dc7f/paradigm-shifts-in-faith-from-complementarianism-to-patriarchy.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>This week the Rebels continue the new mini series started last week about Paradigm Shifts in faith and doctrine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A paradigm shift is a fundamental change in thinking or assumptions. Certain doctrines, when discovered in scripture or embraced in the life of a believer have the potential to change EVERYTHING!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second installment of this fun series P Nate, #1 and Air Jordan are back in Garage-Mahal to discuss why Complementarianism is not enough... and how they&rsquo;ve transitioned from a pretty complementarian lite- to a rich and robust Patricarchical view of the World.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Tuesday, November 15th, 2022. Just a heads up ladies and gentleman, I will be out of the country and into Canada with Gabe the Waterboy the 16th-21st, so we will only have a newsbrief today, and Wednesday morning, but not to worry, I&rsquo;ll be back next week to bring you the news&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Redballoon</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so long ago, the American dream was alive and well. Employees who worked hard were rewarded, and employers looked for people who could do the job, not for people who had the right political views.&nbsp; RedBalloon.work is a job site designed to get us back to what made American businesses successful: free speech, hard work, and having fun.&nbsp; If you are a free speech employer who wants to hire employees who focus on their work and not identity politics, then post a job on RedBalloon.&nbsp; If you are an employee who is being censored at work or is being forced to comply with the current zeitgeist, post your resume on RedBalloon and look for a new job. redballoon.work, the job site where free speech is still alive!</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.redballoon.work/flf/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.redballoon.work</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/maricopa-election-officials-launched-pac-in-2021-to-stop-maga-candidates?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/maricopa-election-officials-launched-pac-in-2021-to-stop-maga-candidates?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maricopa election officials launched PAC in 2021 to stop MAGA candidates</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been revealed that embattled Arizona's Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer and Supervisor Chairman Bill Gates in 2021 started a political action committee to stop MAGA candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 17, 2021, Meg Cunningham from the Kansas City Beacon tweeted that Richer, "the Maricopa County recorder, is launching a PAC to support Rs running for non-federal AZ offices who 'acknowledge the validity of the 2020 election and condemn the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as a terrible result of the lies told about the November election.'"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richer retweeted her saying, "Thanks to a few generous donors this is now launching. Join me if you care about traditional Republican 'stuff' (free people, free markets, rule of law), but also don&rsquo;t believe in conspiracies about the 2020 election or that Jan 6 was a tourist event."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PAC called Pro Democracy Republicans of Arizona claims on their website that they are "fighting to keep our democratic institutions alive."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website is sparse on details aside from how to donate but does have a few sentences on their mission. "The Arizona election wasn&rsquo;t stolen. We Republicans simply had a presidential candidate who lost, while we had many other candidates who won. It&rsquo;s time we Republicans accept and acknowledge that fact."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Candidates come and go. But our democratic institutions are long-lasting, and peaceful transitions of power are a hallmark of the United States.&nbsp; We should not abandon this history in favor of conspiracy theorists and demagoguery."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"To that end, we are launching this PAC to support pro-democracy Arizona Republicans."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political pundits, candidates, and others have continued to slam Arizona&rsquo;s Maricopa County Elections Department for ongoing failures in their election system. Almost a week after election day, the county, as well as the state, are some of the last to not have candidates declared as winners, as votes continue to be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Secretary of State, gubernatorial Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs was in charge of overseeing the election after failing to recuse herself.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1590526914019864577"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1590526914019864577</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:00-2:12</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday night, Republican gubernatorial nominee and Trump-endorsed candidate Kari Lake called out her opponent and Maricopa County Richer as "incompetent."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of Arizona's gubernatorial race between Hobbs and Lake are still pending as is the senatorial race between Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican challenger Blake Masters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appeals Court Rules Against Biden Administration&rsquo;s Student Loan Forgiveness Program</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal appeals court on Nov. 14 entered a ruling against the student loan forgiveness program announced by President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erasing student loan debt would be &ldquo;irreversible,&rdquo; a panel of the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ruled, entering an injunction against the administration pending an appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel consisted of U.S. Circuit Judges Bobby Shepherd, a George W. Bush appointee; Ralph Erickson, a Donald Trump appointee; and Steven Grasz, another Trump appointee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They sided with Missouri and five other Republican-led states that had sued Biden and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona after the announcement of the program, alleging that it was illegal for the executive branch to enact such widespread loan relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden administration officials have said that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 grants the authority for the relief, which is expected to cost about $400 billion and apply to tens of millions of Americans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court ruling came after U.S. District Judge Henry Edward Autrey, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected the states&rsquo; suit, finding that they lacked standing to sue on behalf of the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three appeals judges disagreed, finding that MOHELA is effectively an arm of the state of Missouri and even if it wasn&rsquo;t, the financial effect of the administration&rsquo;s debt discharge still threatens Missouri because it would affect the state&rsquo;s Lewis and Clark Discovery Fund, a capital fund that can support projects at colleges. The fund receives money from MOHELA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling follows a separate appeals court decision to temporarily block the program and U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman, a Trump appointee, finding it unconstitutional and vacating it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Pittman&rsquo;s ruling, dated Nov. 8&mdash;the same day as the midterm elections&mdash;the administration stopped accepting applications for the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administration lawyers have already appealed that ruling and the government will hold onto information from the 26 million borrowers, including the 16 million who have already been approved for relief, &ldquo;so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court,&rdquo; White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2022/11/14/oregon-leftists-bragging-about-new-gun-control-law-n510693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2022/11/14/oregon-leftists-bragging-about-new-gun-control-law-n510693</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon leftists bragging about new gun control law</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red wave in Oregon didn&rsquo;t happen for the most part, though Republicans took a House seat here and there and performed well in the more rural, western part of the state as usual. The hype surrounding the possibility that Democrat Tina Kotek could be defeated, turning the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion red, fizzled in the end. Another piece of bad news turned up in a ballot measure that didn&rsquo;t draw all that much attention on the national level. Measure 114 passed on election day, ushering in a new round of gun control restrictions and requirements. NBC News launched into a celebration of this &ldquo;victory&rdquo; in which they bemoaned the rising number of deaths involving firearms in recent years while claiming (without evidence) that this new law in Oregon would do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this climate, voters in Oregon have fought back. Heading into the midterm elections, voters took it upon themselves to strengthen gun laws by proposing Measure 114, a ballot initiative that requires a background check, a license and safety training to buy firearms in the state. The measure also prohibits large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon&rsquo;s measure is particularly important because Congress, the courts and many state legislatures have done so little to contain the violence. Meanwhile, the number of gun deaths in the United States has skyrocketed &mdash; in fact, our analysis of the data shows that guns drove a recent spike in homicides and suicides&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the Supreme Court&rsquo;s expansion of Americans&rsquo; right to own guns, it can be frustrating to consider what preventive steps are possible. The Oregon referendum, however, is an example of how laws can prevent gun violence. Firearm purchaser licensing, as contained in the ballot measure, is one of the most effective policies at reducing gun deaths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, there&rsquo;s nothing really unique or groundbreaking about this measure when compared to similar proposals in other liberal states. They are requiring all purchasers of firearms to complete a background check (which everyone already had to do anyway) and complete mandatory gun safety training before being able to obtain a license to own a gun. It also limits the size of magazines to ten rounds of ammunition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Measure 114 really does is make it more time-consuming, expensive, and laborious for lawful residents to legally obtain a firearm. NBC goes to great lengths to document how many gun-related deaths have been recorded in the country of late, concluding that Oregon&rsquo;s law will impact those statistics in a positive way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, what&rsquo;s entirely missing in this liberal &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; is any sort of context or even a nod to the reality of gun crime in the United States. Yes, more people are getting shot. That&rsquo;s only one facet of the rising violent crime rates we&rsquo;ve been seeing, primarily in urban areas. And the NBC report conveniently ignores the fact that the vast, vast majority of the people being shot are the victims of criminals who could never pass a background check and get their guns on the black or gray markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also ignored in this report is the reality that lower-income minority citizens are disproportionately the victims of these gun crimes. And by making it harder for the law-abiding to obtain a firearm, you&rsquo;re making it hard for them to defend themselves if such a thing happens to them.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/report-ftx-ceo-detained-by-authorities-in-bahamas?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/report-ftx-ceo-detained-by-authorities-in-bahamas?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX CEO detained by authorities in Bahamas</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the collapsing cryptocurrency company FTX, along with two others associated with the company, director of engineering Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang, are "under supervision" in the Bahamas after the trio reportedly were planning on fleeing to Dubai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Cointelegraph, "Right now three of them, Sam, Gary, and Nishad are under supervision in the Bahamas, which means it will be hard for them to leave."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubai is a city in the United Arab Emirates that prior to February 24, 2022, had no extradition treaty with the United States. However, as of that date, the two countries signed a mutual legal assistance treaty which does permit extradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency company FTX, run by CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the second biggest Democrat donor right after George Soros, collapsed last week as details emerged regarding their financial practices, which led to a run by customers on FTX.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX did not have the funds to pay out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"FTX is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the management and handling of client funds. With this latest development, FTX has more questions to answer as scrutiny builds around the SEC investigation," Cryptoslate reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly $5 billion was withdrawn from FTX on Sunday. The trouble began for FTX last week when rival crypto company Binance said they were selling off their holdings of FTT, the proprietary coin of FTX. After Binance's comments, FTX was in financial trouble and essentially sought a bailout from other firms, Binance among them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Post reports that FTX's implosion followed revelations "that co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried had been funneling money to a sister trading company run by his girlfriend." That company, Alameda Research, is run by Bankman-Fried's girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, and is also based in the Bahamas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance announced that they would buy the company, then pulled out of the deal, saying that after some due diligence, they decided it would not be a good investment. Part of the issue for Binance is that Alameda Research, helmed by Bankman-Fried's girlfriend, holds a great deal of their assets in FTT, and FTX had invested their customers' funds into Alameda through a "back door," without oversight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">etails have emerged that FTX had partnered with Ukraine to process donations to their war efforts within days of Joe Biden pledging billions of American taxpayer dollars to the country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one hits close to home for our producer Neil, as this was his first ever favorite fighter when it came to MMA&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2022/11/13/23456635/two-time-ufc-title-challenger-anthony-rumble-johnson-dead-at-38"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.mmafighting.com/2022/11/13/23456635/two-time-ufc-title-challenger-anthony-rumble-johnson-dead-at-38</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-time UFC title challenger Anthony &lsquo;Rumble&rsquo; Johnson dead at 38</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony Johnson, a Bellator fighter and two-time UFC title challenger, has died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was 38 years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MMA Fighting has confirmed the news with sources with knowledge of the situation, following an outpouring of messages on social media regarding Johnson&rsquo;s death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause of death has yet to be announced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson is best remembered for a pair of UFC stints from 2007-2012 and 2014-2017. His first run with the promotion saw him emerge as an intriguing welterweight prospect with unmatched knockout power, while his second run occurred as a light heavyweight. It was during Johnson&rsquo;s second UFC run that he defeated the likes of Glover Teixeira, Ryan Bader, Alexander Gustafsson, and Phil Davis, and earned two cracks at the light heavyweight championship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He announced his retirement after a 2017 title fight loss to Daniel Cormier, but returned to competition in 2021 and fought once for Bellator, defeating Jose Augusto by second-round knockout. In October 2021, Johnson was to fight Bellator light heavyweight champion Vadim Nemkov as part of a grand prix tournament, but was forced to withdraw from that contest due to an undisclosed illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson&rsquo;s pro MMA record was 23-6 with 17 wins coming by way of KO/TKO.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're at the end of a long, tiring day. But we're still going to record a podcast, because we're just that generous, Neighbor! Get ready for some hard-hitting social commentary.</p>
<p>John is concerned his vote may not be counted because of his writing utensil, and the Peaches briefly considered running for school board on the platform: "My Kids Will Never Attend Here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEXT: There's an article published by Desiring God which actually acknowledges the sinfulness of women, and we almost can't believe it!&nbsp; (Title: "She Needs Truth: How Hard Words Serve Women")</p>
<p>LATER: Imagine being inspired and uplifted by a politician's speech... Imagine needing to hear that a Democratic candidate "sees you."&nbsp; Yikes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINALLY: Social media has really messed up a lot of people.&nbsp; The Peaches used to see the Internet as a Mission Field, but maybe we've been sending people out there to evangelize before they were ready. Christians are not doing a great job standing up to the evil, on the whole.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-senate-runoff-walker-hauls-3-million-first-day-new-campaign"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-senate-runoff-walker-hauls-3-million-first-day-new-campaign</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Senate runoff: Walker hauls in $3.3 million on first day of new campaign</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker hauled in $3.3 million in fundraising on the first day of his Senate runoff campaign with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, Walker&rsquo;s advisers shared first with Fox News on Thursday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on Thursday, the campaign raised an additional $1 million before noon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walker, who finished roughly 35,000 votes behind Warnock out of nearly 4 million votes cast in the Senate election in the battleground state of Georgia, is returning to the campaign trail Thursday, teaming up with conservative Sen. Ted Cruz at a rally in Canton, a small city about 40 miles north of Atlanta. Walker&rsquo;s campaign tells Fox News that it plans to be back up on television with an ad later this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Georgia secretary of state's office announced Wednesday that the Senate election was headed to a runoff since no candidate received over 50% of the vote. According to the latest unofficial and incomplete returns, Warnock was at 49.4%, Walker at 48.5% and Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver at 2.1%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Georgia law, if no candidate tops 50% of the vote in the general election, the two top vote-getters face off in a runoff, which this cycle is being held four weeks later on Dec. 6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warnock, who is the minister at Atlanta&rsquo;s famed Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, narrowly edged Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Georgia&rsquo;s twin Jan. 5, 2021, Senate runoff elections. His victory, along with now-Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff&rsquo;s razor-thin win over GOP Sen. David Perdue, gave the Democrats the Senate majority.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Walker campaign source told Fox News that they plan to hold rallies in large-population areas where turnout happens, with the aim to energize supporters of former President Donald Trump, "soft Republicans" and independents to vote in the runoff contest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The source said that it would make sense for Trump and for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also extremely popular with conservatives nationwide, to stump with Walker in Georgia in the weeks ahead and added that the campaign is looking into the possibility of making that happen. The source added that GOP Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp may join Walker on the campaign trail as early as next week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kemp, who comfortably won re-election on Tuesday with an eight-point victory over Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams in a rematch of their 2018 nail-biter, said Wednesday on "Fox and Friends," "I feel very good about getting Herschel across the finish line."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rival Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) announced Thursday a new $7 million field organizing investment in the Georgia runoff, which the Senate Democrats&rsquo; campaign arm says will fund direct voter contact programs, beefing up Warnock&rsquo;s already "robust" field organizing efforts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warnock, in a fundraising email to supporters, noted that "Donald Trump, [longtime Senate GOP leader] Mitch McConnell, and the entire Republican establishment have spent millions to prop up my opponent, Herschel Walker, and defeat me. And they're about to spend a whole lot more to definitively turn Georgia red."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona election results delayed until after weekend, Maricopa officials say</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election results in Arizona will likely be delayed past the weekend as a Maricopa County spokesperson said the counting of ballots will not be done Friday as original expected. The nation anxiously awaits the results of the gubernatorial election and senate races.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kari Lake faced off against Democrat Katie Hobbs, who refused to step onto the debate stage and address her opponent, while Blake Masters seeks to unseat incumbent Mark Kelly for an Arizona senate seat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ali Bradley reports, "AZ: Spokesperson for #MaricopaCounty elections tells me the majority of ballots won&rsquo;t be done being counted until after the weekend. They initially anticipated 95-99% of ballots to be completed by Friday. An historic 290k ballots were dropped off #ElectionDay causing the delay."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the early morning hours of Election Day, voters experienced issues with Maricopa County's tabulator machines, with one polling worker revealing that around 25 percent of ballots were being rejected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then the counting of votes has been trickling in, especially after 290,000 ballots were dropped off Election day. There has been much speculation as to why there are so many delays, and accusations levied at election officials, who are blamed for delaying and stalling the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday evening, Maricopa County officials revealed that 70 out of 223 voting locations, or nearly one out of every three, were impacted by printer issues on Election Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to AZ Mirror, Republicans voting by mail was down during the lead-up to the election, with Democrats leading early turnouts. Republican voters had been expected to turn up in force on Election Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with Charlie Kirk on Tuesday, Turning Point Action Chief Operating Officer Tyler Bowyer revealed that his ballot, and many others, had been printed so badly that machines couldn&rsquo;t read the.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-la-drops-charges-against-konnech-ceo-over-storing-data-on-chinese-servers?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-la-drops-charges-against-konnech-ceo-over-storing-data-on-chinese-servers?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA drops charges against Konnech CEO over storing data on Chinese servers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Los Angeles County prosecutor George Gascon dropped criminal charges against Eugene Yu, CEO of the Michigan election software company Konnech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu was arrested in October, and stands accused of storing data on poll workers in a China-based server, which was a breach of the company&rsquo;s contract with LA County.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the district attorney&rsquo;s office said that it had dropped the case due to concerns regarding the "pace of the investigation" and the "potential bias in the presentation" of evidence in the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mr. Yu is an innocent man," said Gary Lincenberg, Yu&rsquo;s lawyer, adding that "conspiracy theorists" were using the arrest to "further their political agenda."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Times, the sudden dismissal of the case leaves questions unanswered about Yu&rsquo;s activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The district attorney&rsquo;s office did not clarify whether the company had, in fact, stored data in China. It was also not clear whether additional criminal or civil charges could be filed against Mr. Yu or Konnech from Los Angeles County or dozens of other counties that use Konnech&rsquo;s election management software," the New York Times reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu and Konnech had been at the center of a lawsuit against True the Vote, alongside leaders Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization said at a conference over the summer that its team had located and downloaded Konnech&rsquo;s poll worker data from the Chinese servers, and said that it had delivered the data to the FBI.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Konnech accused True the Vote of hacking and defamation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dropping of charges comes just days after Engelbrecht and Phillips were released from jail after refusing to release the name of a confidential informant to judges in the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Reuters, the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office had indicated that it had not ruled out refiling charges after a review of evidence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office said that it had created a new team of investigators to review the "immense volume of digital data" it has collected in the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gascon has faced a recall effort since taking office, with those against Gascon accusing him of being soft on crime. In July, the recall effort had received enough votes to proceed, though in August, it was revealed that they did not in fact have enough signatures, with nearly 90,000 signatures of the 566,857 signatures being from not registered voters and roughly 45,000 were duplicates, according to Los Angeles Magazine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hearing has been moved up regarding the recall effort and their signatures to December 6, with the group being granted an expedited review of the signatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After assuming office in December of 2020, Gascon immediately began sweeping reforms to the criminal justice system in the city. Such reforms include ending sentence enhancements, doing away with cash bail, prohibiting anyone under the age of 18 from being tried as an adult, and refusing to work with immigration enforcement officials.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/SHOCKER-biological-males-dominate-non-binary-division-in-new-york-city-marathon?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/SHOCKER-biological-males-dominate-non-binary-division-in-new-york-city-marathon?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SHOCKER: Biological males dominate 'non-binary' division in New York City Marathon</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the second year running, biological males have dominated the non-binary category of the New York City Marathon, and this year, their physical sporting advantage was awarded a cash prize, meaning equal prize money for men and women competing in the event is now a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NYC Marathon made the decision to include a non-binary category for the first time in 2021 but didn&rsquo;t offer any prize money for the winners. This year, however, the non-profit organization New York Road Runners paid out $9,000 to Jacob Caswell who finished in first place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Mara Yamauchi, a two-time Olympic marathoner, and Robert Johnson, co-founder of LetsRun.com, published an article arguing that gender identity has no place in sport, and that the decision to pay out prize money to the winner of the non-binary category was a mistake and amounts to discrimination against female athletes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A non-binary category &hellip;introduces something which is irrelevant in sport - belief - as a sports category,&rdquo; they explain in the article. &ldquo;Other beliefs, such as religion or political affiliation, are as irrelevant as the belief that one is non-binary.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A non-binary category discriminates against females because males run, on average, about ten percent faster than females&hellip;So females in the non-binary category are not competing on a level playing field,&rdquo; the article continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two athletes went on to question what the prize money was rewarding, stating that it clearly wasn&rsquo;t athletic excellence given that the winner of the non-binary category would have finished in 147th place if competing in the men&rsquo;s category. The NYRR had intended to pay out $15,000 in prize money but only two non-binary runners managed to finish within the 3:10 cutoff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article was shared on LetsRun.com and received a significant amount of feedback, with many agreeing that gender identity has no place in sports, while others felt being inclusive was more important than fairness. Johnson posted a statement in the website&rsquo;s chat forum defending the points made in the article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to numerous people asking why he cared, Johnson responded that the truth matters and there &ldquo;needs to be a respect for objective scientific facts for society to function.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Bible tells ONE story through its 66 books. Scripture is analogous to itself, that is, the Bible is entirely consistent within itself. There are no contradictions. So the best interpreter of the Scripture is the Scripture itself. The New Testament is the best commentary on the Old Testament, and the Old helps us to better understand the New. Interpreting the Bible takes work, but we must read Scripture in light of other Scripture.</p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There Will Be Senate Runoff Next Month in Georgia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Georgia election official said early Wednesday that it is likely there will be a Senate runoff election slated for December between incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and GOP challenger and former NFL star Herschel Walker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warnock appeared to hold a slim lead over Walker with around 98 percent of the vote counted. Warnock, however, did not reach the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff in the state. No election forecasters, including The Associated Press, have called the race.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver garnered about 2.1 percent of the vote. If the Georgia Senate race heads to a runoff, only Walker and Warnock would remain on the ballot&mdash;and Oliver would be removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walker, meanwhile, appeared to be more optimistic. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come to lose,&rdquo; Walker said, according to AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A runoff campaign would be a four-week blitz that, depending on the outcomes in other Senate contests, could reprise the 2020 election cycle, when two Senate runoffs in Georgia doubled as a national winner-take-all battle for Senate control. Victories from Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) left the chamber divided 50&ndash;50 between the two major parties, with Vice President Kamala Harris giving Democrats the tie-breaking vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Runoff dynamics this year would vary widely depending on the Senate makeup. If the Senate majority already has been settled, it could make it easier for Warnock to frame the race as a localized choice between himself and Walker. But if the Georgia outcome determines which party will hold a majority and set the agenda, Walker could have the upper-hand in his effort to tie Warnock to President Joe Biden and national Democrats.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-candidate-unseats-house-veteran-historic-upset-dems-took-granted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-candidate-unseats-house-veteran-historic-upset-dems-took-granted</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP candidate unseats Democratic leader in historic upset: Dems 'took it for granted'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Sean Patrick Maloney was defeated by GOP nominee and State Assemblyman Mike Lawler in a historic House loss in Tuesday's midterm election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawler, who ran heavily on crime and the economy, will unseat the longtime congressman who was first elected in 2013, The Associated Press projects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I think he took it for granted." Lawler said in an interview with Fox News Digital on Wednesday. "As recently as a month ago he was traveling to Paris, London and Geneva to raise money for the DCCC. He did not start campaigning seriously in the district until a couple of weeks ago."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maloney has come under fire in recent days for suggesting that families struggling with the impacts of inflation eat Chef Boyardee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These comments come on the heels of Maloney's frequent trips to high-end European cities over the summer to raise money for House Democrats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawler made crime a key focus of his campaign, running in a district where over half of the households have a cop, veteran or first-responder living in them, according to Lawler.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this big-ticket win, the upset was one of only a handful House pickups for Republicans on a night where many political analysts and polls predicted a "red wave." The balance of power in the House is still in play with many races still uncalled.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ballot-initiatives-protecting-access-abortion-win-across-five-states-midterms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ballot-initiatives-protecting-access-abortion-win-across-five-states-midterms</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballot initiatives protecting access to abortion win across five states in midterms</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters across the country backed a series of ballot initiatives on Tuesday protecting access to abortion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results were largely uniform from California to Montana to Michigan. Voters backed proposals to enshrine abortion rights into law, while simultaneously striking down efforts by conservatives to restrict the practice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, voters passed a ballot initiative creating a right to abortion within the state's constitution. The initiative, which passed by roughly double digits, according to the Michigan Board of Elections, also strikes down a 1931 law that bans abortion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters backed similar ballot measures in Vermont and California enshrining abortion rights into their respective state constitutions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Republican-led Kentucky and Montana, meanwhile, voters struck down ballot initiatives seeking to restrict access to abortion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky's citizens opted against amending the state constitution to clarify there is no right to abortion or a requirement for the government to fund the practice. The initiative failed by a 52-47% margin with nearly 90% of votes counted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montana's voters, on the other hand, are poised to reject a ballot measure codifying into state law federal protections for infants born after a botched abortion. The initiative would have defined an infant "alive" at any gestational age as a legal person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have also instituted criminal penalties for health care providers that did not provide life-saving care to infants born during an attempted abortion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While votes are still outstanding and the ballot initiative has not been officially rejected, opponents have a healthy lead.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 Election Cycle Sets Midterm Spending Record of $16.7 Billion</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 election cycle set a midterm spending record of $16.7 billion, according to OpenSecrets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total represents money spent on both federal and state races.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No other midterm election has seen as much money at the state and federal levels as the 2022 elections,&rdquo; Sheila Krumholz, OpenSecrets&rsquo; executive director, told CNBC. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing record-breaking totals spent on elections up and down the ballot.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats raised over $1.1 billion from grassroots donors in 2022, double the amount of Republicans&rsquo; grassroots efforts, according to the WinRed and ActBlue fundraising platforms, the Financial Times reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican PACs and committees out-raised Democrat committees and PACs by about 50 percent for a total of $1.1 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican donors who greatly contributed to the effort were historically active GOP backers. Half of the GOP committee and PAC money came from about 10 donors, &ldquo;including $77mn from Richard Uihlein, $67mn from Ken Griffin, $44mn from Jeff Yass and $40mn from Timothy Mellon. Steve Schwarzman, Peter Thiel and Larry Ellison have each given $31mn-$34mn to these groups,&rdquo; the Times reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the money was spent on Senate races.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/08/zelenskyy-negotiations-russia-economy-midterms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/08/zelenskyy-negotiations-russia-economy-midterms/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&rsquo;s Zelenskyy Says He&rsquo;s Open To Negotiations With Russia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signaled a willingness to consider negotiations with Russia after it was reported Washington has urged Ukraine to ease up on its hard line against negotiations with Russia on Monday, according to The Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking ahead of his video address to the global climate summit held in Egypt, Zelenskyy laid out several conditions for returning to the negotiating table with Moscow, including respecting Ukraine&rsquo;s pre-war borders, offering reparations for the damage done to Kyiv and prosecuting those who have committed war crimes, according to the WSJ. The U.S. urged Kyiv to maintain a public appearance of openness to negotiating with Russia, even while acknowledging Russian leaders will not agree to withdrawal from occupied areas of Ukraine, The Washington Post reported Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. leaders have reiterated that Ukraine has the final word on negotiating terms, according to the WSJ. Kyiv previously insisted no further talks could happen unless new leadership took over at the Kremlin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouragement to keep an open posture toward negotiating with Russia is intended to secure the lasting support of allies, officials familiar with the matter told the Post. Many governments, including the United States, face growing opposition from constituencies concerned that funding the Ukrainian resistance could deepen economic hardships as inflation refuses to let up and food shortages loom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy also on Monday urged &ldquo;unwavering unity&rdquo; in the U.S. until Ukraine sees &ldquo;peace restored,&rdquo; according to AFP, as the U.S. will see votes cast for midterm elections Tuesday evening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. support for Ukraine could dip if the GOP achieves a majority in the House and Senate after the elections, a possibility increasingly on the table as Republican favorability rose in pre-election polls. Republicans have been more willing than their Democratic counterparts in Congress to express skepticism about the logic behind weapons transfers, and Republican voters consistently fall lower than Democrats in the opinion polls measuring willingness to support Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Republican leaders have doubled down on their stance in support for Ukraine.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/celtics-jaylen-brown-disagrees-terms-kyrie-irvings-return-nets-doesnt-think-hes-antisemitic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/sports/celtics-jaylen-brown-disagrees-terms-kyrie-irvings-return-nets-doesnt-think-hes-antisemitic</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celtics' Jaylen Brown disagrees with terms of Kyrie Irving's return to Nets, doesn't think he's antisemitic</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown said on Monday the National Basketball Players Association disagreed with the benchmarks set for Kyrie Irving in order for him to return from his Brooklyn Nets suspension.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving was suspended for at least five games until he adequately came to terms with the harm he caused when he tweeted a link to a movie that spread antisemitic misinformation. According to The Athletic, the terms included an apology, a donation of the agreed-upon sum of $500,000 to organizations that fight hate, complete sensitivity training, complete antisemitic/anti-hate training, meet with Anti-Defamation League and Jewish leaders in Brooklyn and meet again with Nets officials, including team owner Joe Tsai.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown told the Boston Globe on Monday he did not believe Irving was antisemitic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I don't believe Kyrie Irving is antisemitic," he told the paper. "I don't think people in our governing bodies think he's antisemitic. He made a mistake. We understand from an outside perspective how important sensitivity is to not condone hate speech and not condone anything of that nature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We don't want to stand up for somebody in order to not condemn hate speech, but I don't believe Kyrie Irving is antisemitic. And hopefully the NBA feels the same way."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said the players had "discomfort" with the rules, because the current CBA does not include exact guidelines on punishment regarding social media posts. The Washington Post&rsquo;s Candace Buckner noted that Adam Silver fined J.R. Smith in the past for previous social media posts. Irving tweeted a screenshot of the synopsis of the movie.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There is an interesting distinction between what somebody says verbally and what somebody posts as a link on a platform with no description behind it," Brown said. "Some people will argue there's no difference and some people will argue there is a difference. There's no language in our CBA. There's no rules against it. This is uncharted territory for everybody.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The terms in which he has to fulfill to return, I think not just speaking for me, speaking as a vice president from a lot of our players, we didn't agree with the terms that was required for him to come back, and we're waiting for this Tuesday meeting to happen to see what comes of it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown and Irving are vice presidents of the players union. Irving met with NBA commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning ladies and gentleman, this is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, November 9th, 2022. The midterm elections are still in full swing in some states, as results are still trickling in&hellip; let&rsquo;s get to the news:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As things stand now according to the Associated Press:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP leads the democrats with 47-46 seats taken. 51 is needed for majority.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the house, the GOP leads with 199 seats to the democrats 174 seats. 218 seats are needed for majority.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Arizona, currently democrat Katie Hobbs holds a slim lead over Republican Kari Lake, with 66% of the vote reporting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Oregon, Tina Kotek the democrat, has a slim lead over Republican Christine Drazen, with 67% of the vote reporting&hellip; and Drazen for those of you who remembered even had the support of one of the Nike founders.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2022/11/09/who-will-republicans-hold-accountable-for-tuesday-night-n2615702"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2022/11/09/who-will-republicans-hold-accountable-for-tuesday-night-n2615702</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Voters Deserve Answers and Accountability</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's no way to sugarcoat it &mdash; Republicans got bamboozled in the midterms. All the polls that we reported showing Republican candidates surging in the final weeks of their campaigns, the race ratings from the Cook Political Report, and the overconfident statements from GOP leaders were all significantly overly optimistic about what we all watched play out on Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were GOP victories &mdash; Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio in Florida, J.D. Vance in Ohio, Ted Budd in North Carolina, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Jen Kiggans in Virginia, to name a few &mdash; but conservatives were sold a false bill of goods from the leaders tasked with delivering GOP majorities. Those promising great success in order to consolidate power, in a drapes-measuring move, hoping to land a leadership position in a new Republican majority may be the worst offenders who owe the Republican electorate the most answers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them are the leadership of the Republican National Committee, including Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the chairs of the National Republican Congressional Committee &mdash; Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) &mdash; and National Republican Senatorial Committee &mdash; Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), and the House Republican Leader &mdash; Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an election year that favored Republicans purely for its timing as the first midterm of the Biden administration, an advantage that should have been helped by a president with chronically underwater approval, inflation above eight percent, surging crime and drug overdose crises, a wide open border, and so many more reasons, there's no reason Republican candidates should have performed as poorly as they did.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://redstate.com/bonchie/2022/11/09/breaking-pennsylvania-senate-race-called-n655867"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://redstate.com/bonchie/2022/11/09/breaking-pennsylvania-senate-race-called-n655867</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania Senate Race Called for Fetterman</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat John Fetterman has won the Pennsylvania US senate election against Republican Mehmet Oz. The race ended up close, but Fetterman&rsquo;s overperformance with blue-collar voters pushed him over the finish line. He will now head to Washington, DC, in January as part of what will almost certainly remain a Democrat-controlled Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can you say? The Republican Party lost to a man who is not cognitively all there. As Matt Walsh put it: The Republican Party outside of Florida has no message. No discipline. No leadership. No courage to confront the important issues head on. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re losing to literally brain damaged candidates. We need a total overhaul.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I think I like Jeff Durbin&rsquo;s take better: &ldquo;Our nation won't see meaningful and lasting change apart from Christ through any election. Transformation comes through regeneration and repentance. Hope is in the King and not the legislature. Red without His blood is meaningless. Conservative without Christ is futile.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Results in Nevada Senate race delayed due to paper ballots</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada's midterm election results have been delayed, according to local election officials, leaving the state's high-stakes Senate race outcome in the balance as of early Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving the news: Two counties where the vast majority of Nevada voters reside aren't expected to start counting some mail-in ballots until Wednesday, The Nevada Independent reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Clark County, a shortage of election workers was causing the delay, while Washoe County received large volumes of mail and drop-off ballots, per the Independent, which spoke to county officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada state law also allows mail-in ballots to arrive days after Election Day so long as they are postmarked by Nov. 8, per Forbes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada's race is one of four key Senate battlegrounds that remained uncalled early Wednesday. Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona are also unresolved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they're saying: "Clark is not counting drop boxes tonight, but, to be clear, we said all along that we would only have some of the results on election night," Jennifer Russell, a spokesperson for the Nevada secretary of state, told NBC News Tuesday. "By law, Nevada counties have until Nov. 12 to receive mail ballots."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We're all used to elections where it was as simple as plugging in USB sticks and running the results," Bethany Drysdale, a spokesperson for Washoe County, told the Reno Gazette Journal. "We can't do that now because there are so many paper ballots. It's going to take longer. This is the new normal for election night."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/2022-midterm-elections-voting-results-predictions-candidates-updates"><strong>https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/2022-midterm-elections-voting-results-predictions-candidates-updates</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Key races across the country still being called, House, Senate majorities still up for grabs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Senate results: Warnock, Walker tell supporters to hang tight with race too close to call</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Senate race in Georgia does not have a clear winner as neither incumbent Democrat Sen. Raphael Warnock nor his Republican challenger Herschel Walker have claimed an outright majority of the vote so far.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Wednesday morning, the race is too close to call, according to the Fox News Decision Desk, with more than 3.8 million ballots cast and Warnock leading Walker by approximately 35,000 votes. Warnock holds 49.42% of the vote, with 1,935,464 votes in his favor, and Walker has 48.52% with 1,900,168 votes. Third-party candidate Chase Oliver has 80,895 votes with 97.94% of precincts reporting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia law requires a candidate to surpass 50% of the vote to win an election, and a runoff between the top two vote-getters will be held on Dec. 6 if no candidate meets that requirement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stacey Abrams, after election loss, vows 'I won&rsquo;t stop running for a better Georgia'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams lost to Gov. Brian Kemp for the second time on Tuesday, but indicated that she does not plan on exiting the political arena.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams gave a concession speech on Election Night&nbsp; after results showed that she had lost to Kemp in a race that was not particularly close.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams famously declined to formally concede to Kemp in 2018 after a narrow defeat, claiming at the time that the election was rigged by voter suppression. This time around, she made no such claim and only looked to the future.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Alabama election results: Republican Katie Britt becomes state's first female elected senator</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Katie Britt has made history by becoming the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The self-described 40-year-old "mama on a mission" is projected by Fox News&rsquo; Decision Desk to defeat Democrat Will Boyd after, so far, capturing around two thirds of the vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Republican George Santos flips Democratic House seat in New York</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican George Santos flipped New York&rsquo;s 3rd Congressional district Wednesday and secured another House seat for the GOP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santos defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman, who was vying to fill the Long Island seat after Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi announced he would be retiring to take a stab at New York governor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suozzi came in a distant third in the Democratic primaries in the governor&rsquo;s race, but Santos secured his place in Congress by running on cutting taxes, boosting border security and rallying against cashless bail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press called the race shortly after 1:30 a.m. once the Republican held a lead of 54.2% of the vote over Zimmerman&rsquo;s 45.8%, with 90% of the votes already counted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s worth noting that Santos is a homosexual&hellip; so we need to be praying for his repentance on that front.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Squad&rsquo; rolls to easy victories in House races</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the worst news of the day&hellip; The progressive House members collectively known as the &ldquo;Squad&rdquo; easily won reelection in their respective elections on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Cori Bush, D-Mo., and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., were all projected by The Associated Press as winning by wide margins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowman, who represents New York's 16th Congressional District comprising parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, had the slimmest margin of victory and yet still was leading 65%-34% against Republican challenger Miriam Flisser, with more than 91% of results reporting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley, and Tlaib were the founding members of the "Squad," who gained notoriety as freshman lawmakers after the 2018 election for pushing the Democratic House conference to the left. Bush and Bowman joined the informal group after winning election in 2020.</span></p>

<p><strong>Kentucky voters reject constitutional amendment declaring no right to abortion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in Republican-leaning Kentucky have rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have denied any right to abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of Tuesday&rsquo;s election comes months after the Supreme Court overturned the right to abortion in a decision that has led to near-total bans in a dozen states, including in Kentucky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ballot question had asked Kentuckians if they wanted to amend the constitution to say: "To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outcome highlights a gap between voters and the state&rsquo;s Republican-controlled Legislature, which added the proposed amendment to the 2022 general election slate a year ago in a move some thought would drive more conservative voters to the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While seen as an important win for abortion-rights advocates, the amendment's defeat will have no practical impact on the right to an abortion if a sweeping ban on the procedure approved by lawmakers survives a legal challenge presently before the state Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><strong>Michigan voters pass measure protecting abortion rights, other pregnancy-related decisions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people of the state of Michigan voted in favor of a new measure that protects abortion and other decisions related to reproduction and pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposal 3 amends the state constitution by adding rights to abortion and contraception. It states that everyone has a "fundamental right to reproductive freedom," defining this as including -- but not being limited to -- "prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management, and infertility care."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure also allows the state to regulate abortion after the time a fetus becomes viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approval of the proposal came months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which gave states the power to protect or ban abortion. The decision in June lead to near-total bans in a dozen states and was a hot topic leading up to the midterms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The passing of the proposal puts a definitive end to a 1931 ban on abortion that had been blocked in court, but could have been reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents to the measure said protecting abortion rights could have far-reaching effects on other laws in the state, such as one requiring parental notification of an abortion for someone under age 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal experts said changes to other laws would only happen if someone sued and won, a process that could take years and has no certainty of success, The Associated Press reported.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn Nets Reportedly Have 6 Demands Including Sensitivity Training That Kyrie Irving Must Meet In Order To Be Reinstated</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new report claims the Brooklyn Nets have at least six demands Kyrie Irving must meet in order for him to be reinstated for the team after they suspended him for sharing a movie link to his Twitter account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving was indefinitely suspended after he shared an Amazon link to the film Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America The Movie to his Twitter account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the suspension announcement, Irving apologized for sharing the movie link.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now a new report from The Athletic&rsquo;s Shams Charania claims the Nets have six demands Irving must meet in order to return to the team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charania wrote on Twitter, &ldquo;Sources: Nets have delivered Kyrie Irving six items he must complete to return to team: &ndash; Apologize/condemn movie &ndash; $500K donation to anti-hate causes &ndash; Sensitivity training &ndash; Antisemitic training &ndash; Meet with ADL, Jewish leaders &ndash; Meet with Joe Tsai to demonstrate understanding.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unclear how legitimate these demands are given Irving had previously announced in a joint statement with the NBA and the Anti-Defamation League that he would donate $500,000 to the Anti-Defamation League.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADL rejected Irving&rsquo;s donation with the organization&rsquo;s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt responding to Irving&rsquo;s apology. YouTuber Ryan Kinel of Sports Wars reacted to this list of demands and the actions the Brooklyn Nets and the NBA have taken against Irving.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>This week in the thought of Thomas Aquinas, we examine the idea of natural law, and conclude that, as articulated by Aquinas, it is an idea that gives unwarranted scope to human reason, and effectively makes God equal with His law. In contrast, Scripture teaches that God is the source of all definition, and that human law must be positivized in an historical context.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief, for Tuesday, November 8th, 2022. I hope you all had a wonderful weekend with you and yours. And happy election day by the way! Get out and VOTE today, as it is our duty as Christians to work to shape this nation in God&rsquo;s image. Without further adieu, let&rsquo;s get you caught up on the news:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk endorses GOP in midterms</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet posted on Monday morning, less than 24 hours before Election Day, new Twitter owner Elon Musk recommended that Americans vote for Republican candidates during their visit to the polls tomorrow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet addressed to "independent-minded voters," Musk wrote, "Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk&rsquo;s tweet comes as Republican candidates in key states have either taken the lead or have come within striking distance of their Democrat counterparts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Arizona&rsquo;s Senate race, incumbent Mark Kelly is up just one point, according to RealClearPolitics&rsquo; average of polls. In the state&rsquo;s gubernatorial race, Republican candidate Kari Lake is up 1.8 points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pennsylvania, GOP Senate candidate Mehmet Oz is up 0.1 percent over Democrat John Letterman. In a poll from Trafalgar, Republican candidate Doug Mastriano is down just 4.3 points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blue state of New York, gubernatorial incumbent Kathy Hochul holds a 6.2 point lead over Lee Zeldin, who has quickly closed the gap ahead of Election Day. Independent polls have pointed to Zeldin taking the lead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Florida&rsquo;s governor race, incumbent Ron DeSantis holds an 11.5 point lead over Democrat challenger Charlie Crist, according to RealClearPolitics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in the deep blue states on the west coast, Republican challengers are closing the gap.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer confidence in the housing market hits a new low, according to Fannie Mae</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising mortgage rates, high home prices and uncertainty in the overall economy have Americans feeling more pessimistic about the state of the housing market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, just 16% of consumers said they thought now is a good time to buy a home, according to a monthly survey by Fannie Mae. That is the lowest share since the survey began in 2011. The share of respondents who thought now is a good time to sell a home also dropped from 59% to 51%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fannie Mae&rsquo;s survey looks not just at buying and selling but tests sentiment about home prices, mortgage rates and the job market. It combines them all into one number, which also fell for the eighth straight month and now sits at a new low.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A higher share of consumers, 37%, said they expect home prices to drop in the next 12 months. That compares with 35% in September. More also believe mortgage rates will rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-rising interest rates are what turned the red-hot housing market on its heels in early summer. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage started the year near a record low, around 3%. By June it crossed 6%, and it&rsquo;s now just over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As continued affordability constraints reduce homebuyer demand, and homeowners become reluctant to sell at potentially reduced prices, we expect home sales to slow even further in the coming months, consistent with our forecast,&rdquo; wrote Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae&rsquo;s chief economist, in a release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home prices dropped again in September, according to Black Knight, albeit at a slower monthly pace than they did in July and August. Prices are now down 2.6% since June, the first three-month decline since 2018, when interest rates also rose. It is the worst three-month stretch for home prices since early 2009. Prices, however, were still 10.7% higher in September than the same month last year.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Blocks NY Gun Law, Excoriates Democrats Trying To &lsquo;Eviscerate The Bill Of Rights&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Trump-appointed judge in New York last week blocked a gun law from taking effect and took Democrats to task for trying to &ldquo;eviscerate the Bill of Rights.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge John Sinatra Jr. issued an injunction blocking a gun law that bars people in New York from bearing arms in places of worship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The court reiterates that ample Supreme Court precedent addressing the individuals right to keep and bear arms &ndash; from Heller and McDonald to its June 2022 decision in [New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen] &ndash; dictates that New York&rsquo;s new place of worship restriction is equally unconstitutional,&rdquo; Sinatra said, The Daily Caller reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Constitution and the Bill of Rights are the Status quo &ndash; not 2022 legislation on the books for nine weeks,&rdquo; the judge continued, taking aim at the Democrat-controlled New York legislature. &ldquo;Legislative enactments may not eviscerate the Bill of Rights. Every day they do is one too many.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The nation&rsquo;s history does not countenance such an incursion into the right to keep and bear arms across all places of worship across the state,&rdquo; Sinatra wrote. &ldquo;The right to self defense is no less important and no less recognized at these places.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal judge in October issued a temporary hold on the law, similarly writing, &ldquo;In Bruen, the Court made the Second Amendment test crystal clear: regulations in this area is permissible only if the government demonstrates that the regulation is consistent with the Nation&rsquo;s historical tradition of sufficiently analogous regulations. &hellip; New York fails that test. The State&rsquo;s exclusion is, instead, inconsistent with the Nation&rsquo;s historical traditions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen decision, the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that longtime restrictions New York placed on carrying concealed firearms run in violation of Americans&rsquo; Second and 14th Amendment rights, The Daily Wire reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case centered on a 1911 New York state law that conditioned the right to a concealed carry permit on &ldquo;good moral character&rdquo; and &ldquo;proper cause.&rdquo; The Supreme Court majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, took issue with the latter condition, which unlawfully forced New Yorkers to demonstrate &ldquo;a special need for self-defense.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need,&rdquo; Thomas wrote. &ldquo;That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant&rsquo;s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Press sec says Biden's 'words were twisted' when he said he wanted to shut down coal plants</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a White House press briefing on Monday, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about Joe Biden's remarks on Friday where he promised to shut down coal plants across the country and she said it was "a bit loud and hard to hear."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v1sb6as-november-7-2022.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v1sb6as-november-7-2022.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Biden promised to permanently end coal production in the United States while speaking in Carlsbad, California at a political event "touting his administration's economic policies."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden claimed that the US is going to "become a wind generation" and "it&rsquo;s going to save them a hell of a lot of money and using the same transmission line that they transmitted the coal-fired electric on, we're going to be shutting these plants down all across America and having wind and solar power."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, said on Saturday that President Biden's comments were "outrageous" and that the president owed coal miners an "immediate and public apology."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Manchin's response, Jean-Pierre put out a statement that read, "The President&rsquo;s remarks yesterday have been twisted to suggest a meaning that was not intended; he regrets it if anyone hearing these remarks took offense."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The President was commenting on a fact of economics and technology: as it has been from its earliest days as an energy superpower, America is once again in the midst of an energy transition," the statement read, indicating that the US must embrace "clean and efficient American energy."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court Orders Release of True the Vote Leaders From Jail</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two leaders of the election integrity group True the Vote were released from jail after an appeals court overruled a judge&rsquo;s order that they be detained for contempt of court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips were ordered released by a panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit late on Nov. 6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;IT IS ORDERED that Petitioners&rsquo; opposed motion for release from detention is GRANTED pending further order of this court,&rdquo; the panel said in the order, which was obtained by The Epoch Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel consisted of Circuit Judges Catharina Haynes, a George W. Bush appointee; Kurt Engelhardt, a Donald Trump appointee; and Andrew Oldham, a Trump appointee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht and Phillips were released on Nov. 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht and Phillips were sent to jail on Oct. 31 by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt, a Reagan appointee, who found them in contempt of court for not revealing the identities of people who allegedly accessed information from Konnech, a Michigan-based election management software company whose founder was recently arrested for allegedly stealing poll worker data and hosting the information on servers in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order for confinement was to be in place until the defendants &ldquo;fully comply&rdquo; with an order that they reveal certain information, including the identities, Hoyt said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht and Phillips say they passed on information that was legally obtained from Konnech to the FBI. One of their attorneys identified one of the individuals in question, Mike Hasson, during an October hearing. But they have declined to share the name of the second person. Both the individuals are FBI informants, Phillips asserted during one hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contempt order came after Konnech sued True the Vote and its founders for defamation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its opposition to the petition, Konnech said that the True the Vote founders were trying to &ldquo;strip the District Court of its contempt power&rdquo; and that they &ldquo;have no one but themselves to blame for their confinement&rdquo; after defying Hoyt&rsquo;s order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers for the firm said, &ldquo;Petitioners&rsquo; imprisonment is not an emergency especially in this case where the Petitioners are contemnors and recalcitrant witnesses who hold the keys to the jailhouse, and can free themselves immediately upon purging their contempt.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Houston Astros, did this:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOUSTON &mdash; The Astros&rsquo; manager stood on the stage where the World Series trophy was presented late Saturday night and channeled his inner Jimmy Johnson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;How about those Astros!&rdquo; Dusty Baker said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 25 seasons managing in the major leagues and two previous trips to the World Series, Baker is finally a world champion manager. With the Astros&rsquo; 4-1 victory over the Phillies in Game 6, the 73-year-old Baker became the oldest manager to lead a team to a World Series title.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hired to stabilize the organization before the 2020 season &mdash; in the aftermath of the team&rsquo;s sign-stealing scheme from 2017 that cost former manager A.J. Hinch his job &mdash; Baker might now be the most popular man in Texas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker took the Giants to Game 7 of the World Series in 2002 before they lost to the Angels. Under his guidance last season, the Astros made it to the World Series before losing to the Braves in six games.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Astros rolled to the AL West title this season, winning 106 games, before starting the postseason 7-0 with ALDS and ALCS sweeps of the Mariners and Yankees, respectively. The Phillies, however, jumped ahead 2-1 in the World Series, before the Astros closed it out with three straight victories.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>On this week's episode of OPEN MIKE, Mike is joined by writer and editor James Pew to talk about the false narrative surrounding the Truth &amp; Reconciliation movement which has been used by grifters for political power and financial gain, ironically, slaughtering both truth and reconciliation on the alter of special interest.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief for Friday, November 4th, 2022. It&rsquo;s Friday everyone! We made it!

<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/new-forecast-predicts-republicans-will-have-a-good-night-on-tuesday_4839469.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/new-forecast-predicts-republicans-will-have-a-good-night-on-tuesday_4839469.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are projected to have a good night on Nov. 8 in the Senate, according to a new forecast released Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model from RealClearPolitics shows that the GOP will control the Senate with 54 seats, as compared to Democrats&rsquo; 46 seats. It predicted that Republicans will now likely take seats in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes as recent polls signaled that Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with the direction the United States is heading. One from Gallup found that 17 percent of respondents said they&rsquo;re satisfied with where the country is going, which is the worst of any midterm since at least 1982, according to the pollster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, decades-high inflation appears to remain the top issue for many voters. A poll from Quinnipiac released Wednesday found that 36 percent of voters view inflation as the top issue, which far outpaces the No. 2 choice, abortion, which garnered 10 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have targeted the Biden administration and Democratic policies as a primary cause of decades-high inflation. They&rsquo;ve also said that polices around oil drilling and COVID-19 lockdowns have harmed the U.S. economy and that Democrats are to blame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that poll, 34 percent said that they believe President Joe Biden is handling the economy well, whereas 61 percent said he isn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden and members of his party have focused on abortion following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s historic reversal of Roe v. Wade over the summer as well as accusing Republicans and supporters of former President Donald Trump of being extremists who will undermine U.S. institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday evening, Biden continued that trend and attempted to tie the alleged attack targeting Paul Pelosi to claims that the 2020 election was stolen. The suspect in that incident last week, David DePape, was known to be involved in far left-wing circles and reportedly had a history of mental illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several polling analysts on Wednesday told The Epoch Times that polls&mdash;even those that show Republicans pulling slightly ahead of Democrat candidates&mdash;could suffer from a &ldquo;bandwagon effect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poll results from FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics, and others like The New York Times have frequently favored Democrats in Senate and gubernatorial races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Lonny Leitner, vice president of the government affairs firm LS2 Group, said that many polls don&rsquo;t sample enough people.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2022/11/01/kari-lake-takes-another-blowtorch-to-the-media-over-hobbs-hq-break-in-n2615240"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2022/11/01/kari-lake-takes-another-blowtorch-to-the-media-over-hobbs-hq-break-in-n2615240</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kari Lake Torches the Media: You Idiots Will Fall for Anything</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona secretary of state and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs is desperate. Her Hail Mary throw in the waning days of the 2022 cycle was akin to some pathetic exercise to remind voters there&rsquo;s a Democrat on the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, there was a break-in at her campaign headquarters where Hobbs, without evidence, accused Republican opponent Kari Lake of inspiring the burglary. The media ran with it, but Lake is just too good at slapping down narratives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when Lake was recently asked about being an "election denier," she shut it down by sharing statements&nbsp; dating back to 2000 from a slew of high-profile Democrats who questioned our elections where Republicans won. With Hobbs hiding in the bunker, even refusing to take questions about the break-in, Lake trots out there and torches the media over how their narrative about this event aged like milk. The culprit who broke into Hobbs&rsquo; campaign office was arrested, and there&rsquo;s no evidence that the attack was politically motivated</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knows how to counterpunch, especially on the narratives where the liberal media can mount no defense because they&rsquo;re wrong. There are no shades of gray or nuance&mdash;nothing politically motivated about the Hobbs campaign office incident.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1585770475111579649"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1585770475111579649</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doubled down her attack on the press:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1585777715906457600"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1585777715906457600</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wouldn&rsquo;t be asking a question that&rsquo;s for sure&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake has been making the most of her free media opportunities, leading to an impressive poll surge. Recent surveys have Lake ahead, including liberal polls&mdash;Data for Progress has her leading Hobbs by four points. Most attempts to smear Lake as a crank have been mitigated by her two-decade career as a television journalist; Arizona voters are familiar with Lake. Hobbs&rsquo; antics could have been avoided if she had just agreed to debate Lake, but it&rsquo;s too late for that, and the Arizona Democrat most likely would have been eviscerated on the stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, you nominated an atrocious candidate for whatever reason, and now you can&rsquo;t do much with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Arizona to Ohio we go&hellip;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://humanevents.com/2022/11/03/ohio-education-board-vp-insists-biological-sex-is-not-a-scientific-fact?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://humanevents.com/2022/11/03/ohio-education-board-vp-insists-biological-sex-is-not-a-scientific-fact?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio Education Board VP Insists Biological Sex Is Not a 'Scientific Fact'</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vice president of the Ohio State Board of Education does not know what the definition of biological sex is, and does not think it is a scientific fact to say that there is just one definition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha Manchester, who holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Education and has served on the State Board since Jan 2017, made the comments at an executive committee meeting convened to debate a resolution that seeks to reject Biden&rsquo;s proposed Title IX change adding gender identity as a protected characteristic alongside sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution, titled &ldquo;Resolution to support parents, schools, and districts in rejecting harmful, coercive, and burdensome gender identity policies and to protect federal funding subject to Title IX&rdquo; was introduced in September by board member Brandon Shea. It argues that &ldquo;sex is not arbitrarily &lsquo;assigned at birth&rsquo; but rather identifies an unchangeable fact&rdquo; and suggests that the Title IX change would &ldquo;require that K-12 schools socially transition minor children to a different gender without requiring parental consent.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A video clip of the vice president&rsquo;s confusion during the debate about the most fundamental fact of human existence was shared on Twitter by child-safeguarding advocate Chris Elston.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1587901632955961344"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1587901632955961344</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchester&rsquo;s confusion about such a basic fact of biology evidently stems from gender identity ideology pushing the idea that sex is complicated and impossible to define. Google &ldquo;What is biological sex?&rdquo; and the first page of hits contains a baffling array of articles about how sex is complex and there are more than two sexes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the top spot is Planned Parenthood, telling readers that the term biological sex &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t fully capture the complex biological, anatomical, and chromosomal variations that can occur. Having only two options (biological male or biological female) might not describe what&rsquo;s going on inside a person&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an article titled The Myth of Biological sex, Forbes informs readers that &ldquo;there is no one parameter that makes a person biologically male or female.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is simply not true. Sex is defined by which gamete type the reproductive system developed to produce. Males have the reproductive capacity to produce small gametes (sperm), and females have the reproductive capacity to produce large gametes (eggs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to push the idea that the categories of male and female are blurry or don&rsquo;t exist and that therefore males can be women if they say so, a favorite tactic of trans activists is to use people who are born with Disorders of Sex Development (DSDs) as pawns in their linguistic game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activists will point to people born with X0 Turner syndrome for example and suggest that these individuals are neither male nor female, ignoring the fact that Turner syndrome is a DSD that can only affect females. This exact argument was made by expert witness Dr. Greta Bauer in the hearing of a Canadian nurse on trial in British Columbia for allegedly transphobic beliefs, one of which is the belief that there are only two sexes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive committee voted to hold an additional meeting on Nov 14 to continue the debate, according to WOWK 13 News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving overseas&hellip;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-south-korea-threaten-end-kim-regime-north-korea-uses-nuclear-weapon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-south-korea-threaten-end-kim-regime-north-korea-uses-nuclear-weapon</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US, South Korea threaten to 'end' Kim regime if North Korea uses nuclear weapon</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and South Korea issued a joint warning to North Korea on Thursday, warning that any use of nuclear weapons would result in the end of Kim Jong Un's regime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea fired an unprecedented 23 missiles in a single day on Wednesday amid extensive joint air force exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. Kim's regime has made veiled threats about nuclear weapons in recent days as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Any nuclear attack against the United States or its allies and partners, including the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim regime," South Korean Defense Minister Jong-Sup Lee said Thursday, in a joint news conference with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and South Korean militaries announced an extension to a joint air force exercise earlier on Thursday. The move came in response to North Korea launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and two short-range missiles after Wednesday's barrage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Korean media reported that officials believe the North's ICBM failed in flight but did not elaborate. Meanwhile, North Korea's two short-range ballistic missiles fell into the sea to its east. Japan initially sounded alarms after tracking suggested the ICBM would fly over the island nation, but officials later said they lost track of it mid-flight, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea has grown increasingly aggressive since the U.S. and South Korea began joint military exercises in September. The country also flew 12 warplanes near the South Korean border in early October. The sortie included eight fighter jets and four bombers. South Korea responded with a flight of 30 warplanes, but the two groups did not engage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. and South Korea's joint air force exercise, Operation Vigilant Storm, was scheduled to end Friday but will now extend into the weekend following North Korea's launches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Korea had a failed missile launch of its own in October. The malfunction came as the U.S., South Korea and Japan were seeking to send a message to the North Korean regime after it sent its own ballistic missile flying over the island of Japan. U.S. military officials clarified that the warhead on South Korea's missile did not explode, but the propellant caused a large blast and flames.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No injuries were reported from the incident, civilian or otherwise, and South Korean officials say no buildings were damaged.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/01/philly-restaurants-refused-to-serve-astros-before-game-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/11/01/philly-restaurants-refused-to-serve-astros-before-game-3/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loyalty is Philly Special.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Series intensity in the City of Brotherly Love was amplified when two local businesses refused to feed the Astros ahead of Game 3 on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angelo&rsquo;s Pizzeria in South Philadelphia, an institution in the city, refused to provide catering for the visitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;d cook for the Astros, you&rsquo;re out of your mind,&rdquo; a man said in a video posted to the eatery&rsquo;s Instagram account. &ldquo;We said no to them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Astros didn&rsquo;t have much luck at Mike&rsquo;s BBQ, either. The restaurant posted a text exchange with the team that didn&rsquo;t seem to get very far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Houston is widely loathed by a number of fanbases across MLB &mdash; and at least one Phillies player on the roster &mdash; the treatment might not have anything to do with the franchise&rsquo;s recent history of cheating. It seems more likely it&rsquo;s just a good old fashion dose of Philly hospitality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Astros didn&rsquo;t get any reprieve on the field as the Phillies routed them 7-0 in Game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead after Tuesday&rsquo;s game was postponed due to rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phillies crushed five homers with Bryce Harper getting the festivities started with a two-run blast in the first inning. The Phillies are now 6-0 this postseason at Citizens Bank Park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A lot of really good hitters in the lineup,&rdquo; said third baseman Alec Bohm, who added a solo shot to leadoff the second inning against Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games 4 and 5 are in Philadelphia on Wednesday and Thursday night as the Astros look to fight back in series &mdash; and find a place that will serve them food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we go from pettiness, to a genuinely disturbing story&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/11/four-players-suspended-after-brawl-breaks-out-after-msu-vs-michigan-game/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/11/four-players-suspended-after-brawl-breaks-out-after-msu-vs-michigan-game/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four Players Suspended After Brawl Breaks Out After MSU Vs. Michigan Game</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An altercation broke out between players following the Michigan-Michigan State game on Saturday. A crowd of Michigan State Spartans appeared to be attacking Michigan players in the tunnel following the in-state rivalry game. Michigan AD Ward Manuel said Michigan&rsquo;s postgame fight is being reviewed by law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Michigan Police Assistant Chief Melissa Overton said the investigation is ongoing, working in conjunction with the Michigan State Police and Michigan&rsquo;s athletics and football programs. Spartans head coach Mel Tucker said Michigan is working with law enforcement, the Michigan campus leadership, and the Big Ten Conference to assess what happened, including identifying additional players involved and contributing factors in the altercation. Tucker added that the suspensions will stay in place until the investigation, which includes law enforcement, Big Ten, and Michigan, is completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Mel Tucker suspended Four Michigan State players &ndash; Tank Brown, Khary Crump, Angelo Gore, and Zion Young, saying that decisions were made based on video evidence from the incident. Neither Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh nor Manuel would disclose on Saturday which Wolverines were involved in the altercation, although Harbaugh said two players were involved &ndash; one, he said, suffered a nasal injury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the immediate aftermath on Saturday evening, MSU coach Mel Tucker said at his postgame news conference that he was not aware of any altercations after the game between the Michigan players inside the Michigan Stadiums tunnel and that a fact-finding process was underway. The suspensions were ordered after school officials reviewed video of Saturday&rsquo;s 29-7 loss to host team Michigan in Ann Arbor and discovered the four were part of a group of teammates surrounding a rival, Michigan coach Mel Tucker said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident comes amidst a frustrating season for the Spartans. The 29-7 loss to Michigan puts Michigan State at 3-5 overall and 1-4 within their conference, last in the East division. With games looming against #14 Illinois and $16 Penn State, MSU is in real danger of not reaching bowl eligibility. A result that would add further embarrassment to a proud program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&rsquo;s my take&hellip; those players who jumped the Michigan players, should be expelled from Michigan State, and should never put the pads on again&hellip; what an absolute disgrace.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In June, the United States Supreme Court decided a 2nd Amendment controversy and reversed <em>Roe v. Wade</em> citing William Blackstone&rsquo;s Commentaries on the Laws of England as authority. After you listen, you will be astounded to learn how much the cosmology of Genesis Chapters 1 through 3 informed Blackstone&rsquo;s description of the nature of law. You will know what even most Christian lawyers don&rsquo;t know about law.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Gary discusses several Old Testament passages and how they fit with New Testament prophecies. All biblical language must be interpreted in light of how it's used elsewhere in the Bible. Context, time, and previous usage must be taken into consideration to properly discern what the Bible is saying. The basic principles of hermeneutics should always direct how we read and understand the prophetic passages of the Bible.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Thursday, November 3rd, 2022. Good to be back with you all, let&rsquo;s get right into the news!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new statement hinted at that policy change, saying when determining future hikes, the Fed &ldquo;will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists are hoping this is the much talked about &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week&rsquo;s statement also expanded on previous language simply declaring that &ldquo;ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.&ldquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new language read, &ldquo;The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks initially rose following the announcement, but turned negative during Chairman Jerome Powell&rsquo;s news conference as the market tried to gauge whether the Fed thinks it can implement a less restrictive policy that would include a slower pace of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On balance, Powell dismissed the idea that the Fed may be pausing soon though he said he expects a discussion at the next meeting or two about slowing the pace of tightening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also reiterated that it may take resolve and patience to get inflation down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the Fed&rsquo;s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago &ndash; 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing demand has plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn&rsquo;t as bad as feared but also due to growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.09%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just for a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/bidens-cdc-replaces-word-woman-with-pregnant-person-in-flu-vaccine-guidance?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/bidens-cdc-replaces-word-woman-with-pregnant-person-in-flu-vaccine-guidance?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's CDC replaces word 'woman' with 'pregnant person' in flu vaccine guidance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has removed the word woman from sections of its safety guidance on flu vaccines during pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, gendered terms such as woman, women, mother and she/her pronouns were all erased from the Q &amp; A section of the Flu Vaccine Safety and Pregnancy page in August of last year. The words were replaced with gender-neutral language such as &ldquo;pregnant people&rdquo; and the gender-neutral pronoun &ldquo;their.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the words woman and mother still appear in other sections of the CDC website, such as the Vaccines During Pregnancy FAQ page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Influenza is more likely to cause severe illness in pregnant people,&rdquo; says the CDC. &ldquo;Flu shots given during pregnancy help protect the &lsquo;pregnant parent&rsquo; and the baby from flu.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those advocating for the use of gender-neutral language in the healthcare setting argue that the intention is to ensure that everyone feels included.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for example because a tiny number of females who identify as men may become pregnant, the word woman should be removed from maternity care to include them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But feminist campaigners have suggested that the so-called inclusive language only appears to go one way. Ovarian cancer apparently now affects &ldquo;people&rdquo; not women, but prostate cancer still affects men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthline referred to &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;vulva-owners&rdquo; last year on its HPV information pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, MedicineNet.com kept the definition of male as &ldquo;the sex that produces spermatozoa&rdquo; but redefined female as being a complicated mix of chromosomal anomalies and gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has led some to speculate that this new inclusive language is not so much about being inclusive of everybody and more about ensuring that the word woman is never used in a way that excludes males who identify as women, while at the same time not reminding those males of their biology.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/nation/economy/facebook-stock-down-70-down-800-billion-market-cap-year-nears-end"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/nation/economy/facebook-stock-down-70-down-800-billion-market-cap-year-nears-end</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors reportedly disgruntled as Facebook stock down 70%, company out $800 billion in market cap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors in Facebook parent company Meta are reportedly growing dissatisfied with the company's fixation on the "metaverse" as the corporations' stock continues to plunge and its market capitalization continues a long slide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has seen its stock plummet throughout 2022, shedding more than 70% of its value from the start of the year as it fell from over $330 per share in January to nearly $90 per share this week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company's market cap has also plunged from its high last year, dropping from just over $1 trillion in August of 2021 to under $250 billion in November.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors, meanwhile, are reported to be unhappy with the company's business direction, specifically founder Mark Zuckerberg's fixation on the virtual reality "metaverse," a project that has generated relatively little excitement outside of esoteric tech circles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Tierney, an investment officer for Meta shareholder AllianceBernstein, told the Financial Times that, had any other company plowed so much money into a strategically dubious project, "you&rsquo;d have activist investors writing letters, proposing alternative slates of directors, demanding change."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Older, an asset manager at Carmignac, claimed that Zuckerberg has been "tone-deaf to the investment community, doubling down on everything."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The timeline for the metaverse is very stretched. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to know if it is the right move for five or 10 years," he told FT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta, meanwhile, told FT that the company "value[s] the opinions of our investors and regularly engage with them to ensure we&rsquo;re aware of their respective perspectives.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas woman who helmed female ISIS battalion sentenced to 20 years in prison</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Fluke-Ekren, a 42-year-old woman who grew up on a farm in Overbrook, Kansas, was sentenced to two decades in prison on Tuesday for leading the Khatiba Nusaybah, an all-female ISIS battalion in Raqqa, Syria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluke-Ekren's own children asked the judge to hand down the maximum sentence, 20 years, during victim impact statements at the hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluke-Ekren tearfully spoke to the judge before her sentencing. "I deeply regret my choices, but I also deeply sympathize with women abused and raped in Syria."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a plea deal made with the government, Fluke-Ekren admitted she translated and analyzed documents taken from the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, after the terrorist attack on the facility in 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She tried to explain to the court some of her actions during the seven years she spent in Syria. "I was afraid of my conduct in Benghazi. I just didn&rsquo;t see a way out."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluke-Ekren also stressed that for most of her time in Syria, she had been just a mother, caring for her several children as well as other children and their mothers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Judge Leonie Brinkema said she did not find Fluke-Ekren&rsquo;s claims "wholly credible," saying she had "downplayed the impact" of her role in the Benghazi attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge continued, "There&rsquo;s no question you were providing material support for a terrorist organization," and emphasized several times during the hearing that was the crime for which Fluke-Ekren would be sentenced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the sentencing hearing, two of Fluke-Ekren&rsquo;s adult children gave emotional statements against their mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layla Ekren was visibly trembling in court for nearly an hour before she got her chance to tell Brinkema that her mother abused her as a child. She told the court about one instance in Syria when the family had lice, and her mother held her down on the ground and poured the medicine on her eyes in an apparent attempt to blind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Assistant U.S. Attorney Raj Parekh laid out the allegations against Fluke-Ekren in a sentencing memo, writing that she urged a woman to commit a suicide bombing and told others that her oldest son was born after she was raped by an American soldier as a way to gain favor with other terrorists.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/world/middle-east/united-nations-orders-israel-get-rid-nuclear-weapons"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/world/middle-east/united-nations-orders-israel-get-rid-nuclear-weapons</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations calls on Israel to get rid of nuclear weapons</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution calling on Israel to dispose of all of its alleged nuclear weapons and to put its nuclear sites under the jurisdiction of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution, led by the UN's First Committee, which deals with nuclear disarmament, passed 152-5 over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt submitted the resolution to the General Assembly in New York with sponsors including the Palestinian Authority and 19 countries including Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, the Jerusalem Post reported.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five countries that opposed the resolution were Canada, Israel, Micronesia, Palau and the United States. Twenty-four countries including European Union members, abstained from the vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel has never admitted to having nuclear weapons but is widely believed to have them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel is one of the few U.N. member states that has not signed the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iran is a signatory on the treaty, but international authorities believe that Tehran may already possess nuclear weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution, on the "risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East," did not include Iran.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution calls on Israel "to accede to the Treaty without further delay, not to develop, produce, test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons, to renounce possession of nuclear weapons and to place all its unsafe guarded nuclear facilities under the full scope of Agency safeguards as an important confidence-building measure among all States of the region and as a step toward enhancing peace and security."</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/dwyane-wades-ex-wife-fears-175220499.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://news.yahoo.com/dwyane-wades-ex-wife-fears-175220499.html</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dwyane Wade's Ex-Wife Fears He's 'Pressuring' Zaya Into Name And Gender Change For Financial Gain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dwyane Wade&rsquo;s ex-wife, Siohvaughn Funches-Wade, the star&rsquo;s first wife and mother of his two oldest children, filed paperwork this week asking a judge to postpone their daughter Zaya&rsquo;s sex change until she&rsquo;s 18. In Funches-Wade plea to the judge, she claims the NBA star is exploiting their daughter for financial income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Blast, Funches-Wade has sentiments about Zaya being pressured into the permanent change by Dwayne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have concerns that (Dwyane) may be pressuring our child to move forward with the name and gender change in order to capitalize on the financial opportunities that he has received from companies,&rdquo; she said in her legal filing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing was in response to an August petition by Dwayne asking permission for Zaya to legally change her name from Zion Malachi Airamis Wade to Zaya Malachi Airamis Wade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zaya came out as transgender in 2020 at the age of 12. Dwayne&rsquo;s argument concerning his ex-wife&rsquo;s petition was acknowledging that he is the legal guardian of their children and has the legal right to make decisions on his daughter&rsquo;s behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funch-Wade says during a conversation in April, Dwayne told her &ldquo;a lot of money had been already made, and that additional money will be made in relation to our child&rsquo;s name and gender issue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funch-Wade alleges her ex-husband only informs her of their children&rsquo;s life choices out of &lsquo;courtesy&rsquo; but states she wants to be hands-on in all decisions affecting the children. She also claims he is legally required to consult her on &ldquo;major decisions affecting care, welfare, activities, health, education and religious upbringing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funch-Wade and Dwayne will have a hearing in December to determine whether Zaya can change her name and sex without her agreement.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Mere Christianity might be the most important work of apologetics in the last 100 years or more. Copies sold are in the millions. But it is not only a popular success, it is a profoundly insightful and deep work--C. S. Lewis understood the Christian faith better than any other writer in living memory, with the possible exception of G. K. Chesterton. Today the Pugsters reflect on the riches of Lewis's greatest apologetic work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justice Roberts blocks House committee from obtaining Trump tax returns</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has granted an administrative stay of a lower court order that prevents the House Ways and Means Committee from accessing Trump's tax returns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stay is temporary and will last until the court considers a final decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the former president asked the Supreme Court to block the House Ways and Means Committee from accessing his tax returns after it requested six years' worth of Trump's returns as part of an investigation into IRS audit practices of presidents and vice presidents, reports ABC News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump accused the committee of seeking his taxes under dubious circumstances, with a petition to the Supreme Court reading "The Committee's purpose in requesting President Trump's tax returns has nothing to do with funding or staffing issues at the IRS and everything to do with releasing the President's tax information to the public."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, a federal appeals court ruled that the committee would be handed the tax returns, having first sought the returns in 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC reports that Trump "recently failed to block the request on Thursday when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals shot down his request to reconsider a unanimous opinion from one of its three-judge panels approving the committee's access to the documents."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump says that the panel's attempts to get their hands on his returns are purely political.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Voter registration has been a disaster': Democrats have lost 330,000 voters in Florida</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are not poised to do well in Florida next week. In fact, it looks like they may not do well in the state for some time. Since the 2020 election, Dems have lost more than 330,000 registered voters in the state while GOP registrations have surged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Florida Division of Elections released its voter registration report for the November election, known as book closing, earlier this month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken with the reports from the general elections in 2020 and 2018, Republicans and no-party-affiliate voters show a steady increase in voter registration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from 2020 to 2022, Democrats lost 331,810 voters&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News 6 political analyst and UCF professor Dr. Jim Clark says the problem can be laid at the feet of the Florida Democratic Party.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of this large shift in registrations is that the GOP now has a registration advantage in the state for the first time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of last month, there were 5.3 million registered Republicans and just under 5 million Democrats in Florida, marking the first time in state history that the GOP will carry a voter advantage on Election Day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As bad as that news is, what&rsquo;s even worse is who Democrats are losing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have picked up where Trump left off. More than half of their gains in registered voters can be attributed to the 58,000 new Hispanic voters who checked &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; on their forms. Democrats, though, are bleeding support from these communities. The party saw a net loss of more than 46,000 Hispanic voters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reversal is made more stunning because Democrats entered the election cycle firmly aware of the trend and set out to address it, promising they would have dedicated staff and outreach focused on the disparate Hispanic communities that are scattered across the state&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also worth noting that Republicans saw a slight but sizable uptick of Black registered voters in the past two years while Democrats lost more than 71,000, a quarter of which came from Miami-Dade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of all of this is that Republicans are in a position to win in Miami-Dade County for the first time in 20 years. The party has picked up 11,000 new voters in the county since 2020 while Democrats have lost nearly 58,000 voters over the same time span.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of the registration advantage, the GOP also has a big money advantage. CNN notes that in 2020 Michael Bloomberg committed $100 million to help Biden win Florida. This year there are no outside benefactors coming to rescue the Democrats. Meanwhile, Gov. DeSantis has raised nearly $200 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&rsquo; (R) political operation reported raising $177.4 million through Sept. 9, breaking the gubernatorial fundraising record without adjusting for inflation, a new OpenSecrets analysis of state campaign finance filings found. His reelection campaign has raised over $31.4 million since January 2021, and Friends of Ron DeSantis, his state-level PAC that is not subject to contribution limits, raked in $146 million since January 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that even the Miami Herald doesn&rsquo;t see much hope for Democrats this year.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Majority rules: Republicans predicted to have huge House win in new forecast</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Party is set to experience a big win in the House of Representatives come election night, gaining a double-digit edge in the lower chamber of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP needs to have a net gain of at least five seats in the House if it wishes to take the majority, but predictions released on Tuesday indicate that the party may have a 19-seat majority after election night, bringing its total to 236 seats. This estimate is based on if Republican candidates win half of the toss-up races that are in a dead heat, according to Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority by the GOP could be bigger or smaller, depending on voter outcome for the party. In a best-case scenario for Republicans, the party would leave election night with 249 seats, while a best-case scenario for the Democratic Party would be for Republicans to have only 223 seats after the election, according to the outlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Party's lead in the 2022 midterm House elections can possibly be attributed to its focus on inflation and crime, while Democrats have focused on abortion rights following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade earlier this year. An ABC/Ipsos poll conducted from Oct. 28-29 found that 26% of those surveyed ranked the economy as the most important issue, while 23% reported inflation was the most important. The poll surveyed 729 adults and had a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Republicans are expected to take control of the House, the Senate remains up in the air, as the party only won in 50 of the 100 simulated outcomes of the midterm elections for the Senate, according to FiveThirtyEight. The GOP needs to have a net gain of at least one senator if it wishes to take control of the upper chamber of Congress.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Army begins electrification push, C5ISR office aims to smooth bumps in the road</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Army seeks to be more energy efficient between fiscal 2023 and 2027, officials with the service&rsquo;s C5ISR Center told Breaking Defense they&rsquo;re working on a plan to make the transition, whether its to installation microgrids or the planned electrified vehicle fleet, smoother and smarter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Army&rsquo;s ambitious climate strategy, which it estimates will cost upwards of $6.8 billion over five years, follows three lines of efforts: installations, acquisition and logistics and training.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the strategy&rsquo;s implementation plan, released Oct. 5, $5.2 billion of that will go to the installation line of effort, wherein the service wants to field fully electric non-tactical vehicles and reduce greenhouse gasses. The Army also wants to operationalize 55 microgrids on its installations (20 microgrids by fiscal 2024, 15 more by FY26 and then 20 more in FY27) with a total cost of $1.6 billion. (The training portion is expected to cost far less.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service is currently working on implementing the first set of those tactical microgrids, which will allow the service to &ldquo;interconnect&rdquo; power equipment in an &ldquo;interoperable and smart way,&rdquo; Marnie Bailey, power division chief at the Army&rsquo;s C5ISR Center, told Breaking Defense in an interview this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the development of the tactical microgrid standard (TMS) has underpinned a lot of the research the Army has been doing in that area. TMS is an interoperability standard that allows devices to plug and play together, and that&rsquo;s what the Army wants to do with its power systems, Mike Gonzalez, expeditionary power and environmental controls branch chief at the C5ISR Center, added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next year, the Army wants to explore how to do active load management (things that consume power, like electronics) through the use of the TMS, which can monitor the loads and see how much power installations or bases are consuming on a regular basis, whether the facilities are stateside or in far-flung regions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Army&rsquo;s climate plan, the service plans to field an all-electric light-duty-non-tactical vehicle fleet by 2027 and is aiming for an all-electric non-tactical fleet overall by 2035.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Army wants to reap the benefits of the technologies and, at the same time, make sure the transition to these new concepts are seamless for soldiers. As part of that, the service is engaging in &ldquo;soldier touchpoints&rdquo; to get feedback on what is and isn&rsquo;t working. Those soldier touchpoints are key to making sure the Army doesn&rsquo;t spend years on stuff that&rsquo;s not performing in real situations, Gonzalez said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to how the Army sees in the opportunities space over the next fiscal years coming up, both Bailey and Gonzalez summed it up in three words: intentionality, flexibility and maximizing options. It also opens up opportunities for incorporating things like artificial intelligence in the future for things like controls, Bailey added, but the focus right now remains on implementing the interoperability standards into equipment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government Is Set To Spend More On Debt Payments Than The Entire Defense Budget</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest on federal debt is set to skyrocket, potentially surpassing defense spending by as early as 2025, CNN reported Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government made $475 billion in net interest payments in the fiscal year 2022 &mdash; which ended in September&nbsp; &mdash; up from $352 in fiscal year 2021, according to the Treasury Department. The number exceeds the $406 billion spent on transportation and veterans&rsquo; benefits, and is on track to eclipse the roughly $750 billion spent on defense this year between 2025 to 2026, according to CNN, citing financial analytics firm Moody&rsquo;s Analytics. (&lsquo;Reckless&rsquo;: Obama Economist Tears Apart Biden&rsquo;s Student Loan Forgiveness)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Regardless of who wins the midterms or in 2024, there are really difficult decisions that will have to be made,&rdquo; Dan White, an economist at Moody&rsquo;s Analytics, told CNN. &ldquo;This is really going to handcuff them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve has historically kept interest rates low in a bid to encourage economic growth and the purchase of U.S. debt by foreign investors, CNN reported. This contributed to aggressive borrowing campaigns by both the Trump and Biden administrations, which boosted the nation&rsquo;s debt past $31 trillion for the first time this year, that have &ldquo;fast-forwarded us almost an entire generation&rdquo; in terms of debt, White said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With inflation still above 8%, far above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s goal of 2%, it is unlikely that the Fed will slow its pace of interest rate hikes this week in a bid to put downward pressure on the economy and slow inflation, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. As interest rate hikes push economic activity down and the cost of interest up, the U.S. might soon be in a position where it struggles to make its interest payments, White told CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recession, which economists consider increasingly likely, would make it even more difficult to make interest rate payments, since governments typically spend more on social programs during recessions, White told CNN.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">XFL Unveils Eight Cities, Teams for 2023 Season</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, the third time&rsquo;s the charm for the XFL. The newest edition of the spring football league formally announced cities, team names and logos for its new season Monday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XFL failed to live past its first season in 2001 and the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered the 2020 season after only a few weeks, but 2023 will be a new year. The season is set to start Feb. 18, 2023, and games will be televised on ESPN, ESPN2, ABC and FX.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESPN&rsquo;s Laura Rutledge showed off the new logos, names and cities for all eight of the XFL&rsquo;s squads in the announcement video.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the eight franchises and coaches for the 2023 XFL season:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington (Texas) Renegades - Bob Stoops</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D.C. Defenders - Reggie Barlow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houston Roughnecks - Wade Phillips</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orlando Guardians - Terrell Buckley</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Antonio Brahmas - Hines Ward</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle Sea Dragons - Jim Haslett</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Louis Battlehawks - Anthony Becht</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vegas Vipers - Rod Woodson</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief for Tuesday, November 1st, 2022. I hope you guys had an excellent Reformation Day, and that you parents got some sleep with any potential candy crazed kiddos, but if you didn&rsquo;t here&rsquo;s some news to keep you entertained&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/dhs-leaks-starting-in-2020-dhs-began-meeting-with-twitter-facebook-wikipedia-and-more-monthly-to-coordinate-content-moderation-efforts?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/dhs-leaks-starting-in-2020-dhs-began-meeting-with-twitter-facebook-wikipedia-and-more-monthly-to-coordinate-content-moderation-efforts?utm_campaign=64487</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS LEAKS: Starting in 2020, DHS began meeting with Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia and more monthly to coordinate 'content moderation' efforts</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Homeland Security has been working to influence big tech platforms. This became originally evident when the Biden administration launched the ill-fated Disinformation Governance Board early in 2022, but has been a focus of their efforts even beyond that now-defunct unit, and before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit that revealed via appended meeting minutes that former Microsoft executive Matt Masterson, who was formerly an official with DHS, told a DHS director in February 2022 that "Platforms have got to get comfortable with gov't. It's really interesteding how hesitant they remain." This according to The Intercept.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, it was reported that DHS met with Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, and other platforms in order to coordinate "content moderation" operations. These meetings were part of an ongoing initiative which saw collusion and collaboration between DHS and big tech to determine how "misinformation" would be dealt with on those platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas that came under this purview included the withdrawal from Afghanistan, undertaken disastrously by President Joe Biden in August 2021 as well as the origins of the Covid-19 virus, which became controversial enough that users were kicked off social media platforms for expressing the hypothesis that the virus originated in a Wuhan, China lab. A Senate report found last week that this was the most likely scenario. Information that could undermine trust in financial institutions was also targeted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act, signed by President Donald Trump, opened the door to this as it formed a new branch within DHS, which then undertook to deal with online "disinformation." CISA stated its understanding that the mission of that branch of DHS was "evolved," and meant to communicate their concerns on "disinformation" to social media companies. Social media companies took DHS' word for it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS used concerns about "marginialized communities" to justify their reach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of this effort became evidence as a result of an attempt to "fight disinformation" in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. Both Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey spoke about their platform's effort to suppress and censor reporting from the New York Post. They did this, in part, because the FBI had told these platforms to watch out for a "misinformation" dump.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the elction, there were "weekly teleconference to coordinate Intelligence Community activities to counter election-related disinformation." Since then, meetings have taken place every two weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Hunter Biden laptop story broke, revealing the Biden family's influence peddling and shady overseas business dealings with Ukraine and China, social media platforms took the bait from the government and ditched the story. Countless other mainstream media outlets followed suit, going so far as to report on why they would not report on the story, citing "hacking," "misinformation," and a "Russian plot."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these were incorrect, and many outlets, including The New York Times, had to walk it back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of documents revealed in Schmitt's suit, it is now apparent that DHS officials were in fact "leading the push to expand the government's reach into disinformation," and that the government "also played a quiet role in shaping the decisions of social media giants around the New York Post story." Post-election polling showed that many Americans would not have voted for Joe Biden had they known the Hunter Biden laptop story was fact and not a disinformation plot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case that revealed the information was brought this spring by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry against top administration officials in US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It alleged that President Joe Biden and other administration officials "pressured and colluded" with Big Tech companies to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story as well as information regarding the lab leak origin theory of COVID-19 and the security of voting by mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit named White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Chief Medical Advisor and NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and newly announced director of the DHS&rsquo;s Disinformation Governance Board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also named were the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that the federal government had violated constitutional rights to suppress free speech in "one of its greatest assaults by federal government officials in the Nation&rsquo;s history."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/paul-pelosi-attacker-told-investigators-he-planned-break-house-speakers-kneecaps-affidavit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/paul-pelosi-attacker-told-investigators-he-planned-break-house-speakers-kneecaps-affidavit</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pelosi attacker told investigators he planned to break House Speaker's 'kneecaps': affidavit</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David DePape, the 42-year-old illegal immigrant from Canada accused of breaking into the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week and attacking her husband with a hammer, allegedly wanted to hold the congresswoman hostage and threatened to break "her kneecaps" if he caught her lying, according to court documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco police arrived at the home and encountered Paul Pelosi, 82, and DePape struggling over a hammer. After the officers ordered them to drop the weapon, DePape allegedly seized control of it and swung it into Pelosi&rsquo;s skull.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police recovered zip ties in Pelosi&rsquo;s bedroom, found glass broken at the rear of the house, tape, rope, gloves and a journal, according to the FBI affidavit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Pelosi was taken to a hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery on a fractured skull, he told police from the ambulance that he had never seen DePape before and that the intruder showed up in his bedroom around 2:30 a.m. demanding to talk to "Nancy" &ndash; the House Speaker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawmaker&rsquo;s husband told DePape that his wife was out, and DePape allegedly decided to wait for her to return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Pelosi stated that his wife would not be home for several days, and then DePape reiterated that he would wait," according to the affidavit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"DePape stated that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her," the affidavit reads. "If Nancy were to tell DePape the &lsquo;truth,&rsquo; he would let her go, and if she &lsquo;lied,&rsquo; he was going to break &lsquo;her kneecaps.&rsquo;"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"DePape also later explained that by breaking Nancy&rsquo;s kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into Congress, which would show other Members of Congress that there were consequences to actions," the affidavit continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape also allegedly admitted to breaking into the home, using the hammer to shatter a glass door and surprising Paul Pelosi in his bedroom. He also allegedly confessed to cracking the 82-year-old's skull.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Immigrations and Customers Enforcement source told Fox News Monday that DePape is in the U.S. illegally after a "longtime" visa overstay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was born in Canada and emigrated to the U.S. about 20 years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape now faces federal charges and up to 50 years in prison according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/thegrio-kff-survey-black-voters-17-percent-support-defunding-police"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/thegrio-kff-survey-black-voters-17-percent-support-defunding-police</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 17% of black voters support defunding the police: Poll</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 17% of black voters say they support defunding the police, a poll released this week found.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Survey of Black Voters, conducted by TheGrio and KFF and published on Wednesday, asked 1,000 black adults who say they are registered to vote for their opinion on policing. About half of those polled, 48%, said they would like to see police funding kept about the same, while 34% said they wanted increased financial support. Just 17% responded that they support decreased funding for police in their area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of black voters living in urban areas, 39% supported increased funding. That's a 10-point jump from the 29% of black voters living in suburban areas who said they back increased funds for police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll also found that 3 in 4 black voters viewed criminal justice and policing as a "very important factor in making their decision about who to vote for," including 77% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans. The issue of crime was as important for those who made under $40,000 per year as it was for those making over $90,000 annually.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The "defund the police" effort emerged through Black Lives Matter protests, which began in the early 2010s. The idea was initially dismissed as fringe but grew in prominence during the summer of 2020, when the murder of George Floyd sparked racial justice protests across the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notable progressives such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Cori Bush (D-MO), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) became ardent supporters of the defund movement. Other prominent Democrats, such as current Democratic candidates Stacey Abrams and John Fetterman, discussed reallocating funds to social services and investing in minority communities, as well as ideas for reimagining policing, in interviews. Clips from those conversations have been used by Republicans in ads against their candidacies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all Democrats got on board with the defund movement, though. Both President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) made frequent note of their support for increased police funding during the 2020 election cycle and hold the same positions now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/30/kyrie-irving-doubles-down-on-controversial-book-tweet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/10/30/kyrie-irving-doubles-down-on-controversial-book-tweet/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyrie Irving doubles down on controversial tweet: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand down&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a testy exchange with the media Saturday night, Kyrie Irving doubled down and dug in, defending not only his recent social media posts promoting a movie largely viewed as anti-Semitic, but also older ones amplifying conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving&rsquo;s posts from late this past week drew a statement from the NBA and a public rebuke from Nets owner Joe Tsai. Neither the league nor the team, however, convinced Irving to take down his initial post or back down in the slightest. And after the Nets&rsquo; latest loss, a 125-116 drubbing by the Pacers at Barclays Center, he vowed not to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_NkmhJkWA_8"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Kyrie Irving addresses backlash to his recent social media posts&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/_NkmhJkWA_8&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Kyrie Irving addresses backlash to his recent social media posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man&hellip; Things got a little testy&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving does indeed have a huge fan base, with 17.5 million followers on Instagram and another 4.5 million on Twitter. And on Thursday he took to both platforms to promote a 2018 movie called &ldquo;Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America.&rdquo; Both the film and the 2014 book it is based on are filled with anti-Semitic disinformation, including accusations of large numbers of Jewish people worshipping Satan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irving has since been rebuked by the NBA Player&rsquo;s Association.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/0b388ab6-b2ba-4ff2-84fb-3ba2c18e98f4/daily-news-brief-for-friday-october-28th-2022.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily NewsBrief for Friday, October 28th, 2022. I&rsquo;m on my way to Boise to see my mom as we speak, but first, I figured I should get you the news heading into the weekend!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/facebook-fined-25m-for-breaking-washington-state-election-law?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/facebook-fined-25m-for-breaking-washington-state-election-law?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook fined $25M for breaking Washington state election law</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook&rsquo;s parent company Meta was issued a $25 million fine Wednesday for violating Washington state's campaign finance laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court documents, King County Superior Court Judge Douglass North found Meta to be in violation of Washington&rsquo;s political disclosure law 822 separate times between 2019 and 2021 and issued the maximum possible fine for each instance, which totaled up to $30,000 per violation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta was also ordered to "come into full compliance" with the state's election transparency laws within the next 30 days as well as pay the attorney's fees for the case, which Ferguson has requested be tripled for a total of $10.5 million. The final total will be decided by North at a later date.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Seattle Times, the state&rsquo;s election transparency laws, which have been in place since 1972, require ad sellers to "disclose the names and addresses of political buys, the targets of such ads and, the total number of viewers of each ad.&rdquo; The judge found that Meta had intentionally violated the standards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Democrat Attorney General Bob Ferguson said "that he had "one word for Facebook's conduct in this case &ndash; arrogance."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Times, "It intentionally disregarded Washington's election transparency laws," Ferguson said. "But that wasn't enough. Facebook argued in court that those laws should be declared unconstitutional. That's breathtaking."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferguson originally sued Meta, then still known as Facebook, for violation of the 1972 transparency laws in 2018 for $200,000. In response the company said they would stop selling political ads in the state rather than comply with the law. Ferguson filed a second lawsuit against the company in 2020 after a report revealed that the company was still selling political ads which were out of compliance with state law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Times, the company said that the laws "unduly burden political speech" and were "virtually impossible to comply with."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a motion filed in July, Ferguson wrote that Meta had failed to respond to multiple inspection requests regarding political advertisements on its platform in Washington between 2019 and 2021 and after several complaints were filed to the state Public Disclosure Commission, the Executive Director of the agency Peter Lavallee referred the case to Ferguson in September 2021 for potential legal action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spring, Meta filed a motion asking the court to strike down the regulations for commercial advertisers which was denied by North in September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/lori-lightfoot-demands-5-pay-rise-as-chicago-crime-rates-spiral-out-of-control/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/lori-lightfoot-demands-5-pay-rise-as-chicago-crime-rates-spiral-out-of-control/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori Lightfoot Demands 5% Pay rise as Chicago Crime Rates Spiral Out of Control</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot proposed giving herself a 5 percent annual pay increase despite mounting criticisms of soaring violent crime in her city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightfoot currently takes home an annual salary of $209,915, but the Mayor now demands an increase of up to 5 percent each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ordinance announced on Wednesday it would give Lightfoot, city clerk, and treasurer access to a pay increase each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This would mirror the process used by aldermen who are already eligible for the pay rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;To be clear, the ordinance that was introduced today would put the Mayor, the city treasurer, and the clerk in line with all the other elected officials regarding a cost of living increase,&rdquo; Mayor Lightfoot said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pay increase comes as violent crime in Chicago have increased by 37 percent since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shootings in the city are up from the previous weekend when nine murders and 31 victims were reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been a total of 2,313 shooting incidents reported in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last weekend, a total of 51 people were shot in Chicago, with some 11 victims dying in the 43 separate incidents &ndash; nine of the victims being juveniles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, 49,433 more crimes were reported in Chicago than 35,746 in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori Lightfoot vowed to tackle the city&rsquo;s crime rates after she was sworn into office in May 2019, but up to now, she has failed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chicago mayor also made a massive U-turn on her proposal to cut $59million from the Chicago Police Department&rsquo;s budget amid the defund the police&rsquo; protests in the summer of 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Lori Lightfoot denouncing the &lsquo;defund the police&rsquo; movement, Chicago&rsquo;s police union has since issued a vote of &lsquo;no confidence in the Mayor.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia Advances Bill Banning 'Gay Propaganda' and Content Promoting Transgenderism to Children</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the lower house of Russia&rsquo;s parliament, the Duma, voted to approve amendments to the country&rsquo;s 2013 legislation banning "gay propaganda."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These amendments will expand the 2013 law, which banned the dissemination of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations" to children, expanding it to include those 18 and older, according to the Associated Press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers in the Duma voted unanimously to approve the amendments, but still faces the upper house of Russia&rsquo;s parliament, the Federation Council, before it can be signed into law by Russian President Vladimir Putin, France 24 reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New provisions in the amendment set out to ban "gay propaganda" for all Russians, not just minors, in advertisements, the internet, media, literature, and cinema. Also set to be banned is "propaganda of pedophilia."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendments would also look to ban the "denial of family values," and seeks to stop propaganda that could "cause minors to desire to change their sex."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreigners found in violation of the law could face expulsion.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/business/joseph-vazquez/2022/10/27/soros-gave-176m-lefty-group-pushing-facebook-tiktok-censor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://newsbusters.org/blogs/business/joseph-vazquez/2022/10/27/soros-gave-176m-lefty-group-pushing-facebook-tiktok-censor</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soros Gave $17.6M to Lefty Group Pushing Facebook, TikTok to Censor So-Called Election Disinfo</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another group heavily financed by liberal billionaire George Soros is joining a growing network of organizations he funds calling on Big Tech to do more to censor so-called election &ldquo;disinformation&rdquo; before the midterms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leftist group Global Witness released a co-authored piece of propaganda disguised as an &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; with New York University&rsquo;s Cyber Security for Democracy team (C4D) whining that Facebook and TikTok weren&rsquo;t censoring enough.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group&rsquo;s Oct. 21 press release on its report, headlined &ldquo;Facebook and TikTok fail to block deceptive ads with blatant US midterms disinformation,&rdquo; claimed its &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; was engineered to &ldquo;determine how well social media platforms are living up to their promises to stop disinformation that can destabilise democratic processes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soros&rsquo; Open Society Foundations gave Global Witness $17,657,000 between 2016 and 2020 alone. The group has offices in London, Brussels and Washington D.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group complained that TikTok &ldquo;approved 90 percent of ads featuring misleading and false election disinformation&rdquo; while Facebook allegedly &ldquo;approved a significant number of similarly inaccurate and false ads.&rdquo; Global Witness Senior Advisor John Lloyd tried to drum up fear about a supposed threat to &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; if Big Tech companies didn&rsquo;t up the ante on their censorship operations:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is high time they got their houses in order and started properly resourcing the detection and prevention of disinformation, before it&rsquo;s too late. Our democracy rests on their willingness to act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple media outlets like The New York Times and The Hill gobbled up and regurgitated Global Witness&rsquo; talking points without mentioning the group&rsquo;s financial ties to Soros:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times: &ldquo;TikTok failed to stop most misleading political ads in a test run by researchers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hill: &ldquo;TikTok, Facebook failed to remove ads spreading election misinformation: report.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune: &ldquo;TikTok let through 90% of ads spreading baseless claims around U.S. midterms, new report finds.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press: &ldquo;Report: TikTok bad at culling US election misinformation ads.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian: &ldquo;&lsquo;We risk another crisis&rsquo;: TikTok in danger of being major vector of election misinformation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Witness, however, praised YouTube for its obsession with censoring election content while still finding room to suggest it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough in censoring election content in Brazil. Could that be because Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is an ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump? Bolsonaro is currently in the middle of a highly contested election against leftist and disgraced former Brazilian President Luiz In&aacute;cio &ldquo;Lula&rdquo; Da Silva.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now&hellip; it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve got requests from my coworkers on this one: Our behind the scenes all-stars here at CrossPolitic Anna Hadfield, and Neil Alcomendras. By the way ladies he&rsquo;s still single&hellip; I&rsquo;ll go ahead and start with Neil&rsquo;s request&hellip; and that is Anderson Silva will be fighting Jake Paul in the ring this weekend&hellip; For those that don&rsquo;t know, Anderson Silva is one of the more decorated fighters in mixed martial arts. He is a former UFC Middleweight Champion and holds the record for the longest title reign in UFC history at 2,457 days. This started in 2006 and ended in 2013 and included a UFC record 16 consecutive victories in that span. Now a lot of people think Jake Paul is a joke, but my friend Neil, who knows a thing or two about fighting, says Paul is actually a solid boxer, and an athlete&hellip; but&hellip; the fight may reportedly be in jeopardy&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.badlefthook.com/2022/10/27/23426896/paul-vs-silva-arizona-commission-meet-regarding-anderson-eligibility-fight-boxing-news-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.badlefthook.com/2022/10/27/23426896/paul-vs-silva-arizona-commission-meet-regarding-anderson-eligibility-fight-boxing-news-2022</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake Paul&rsquo;s fight with Anderson Silva on Saturday is in at least potential jeopardy, as the Arizona Boxing &amp; MMA Commission will meet this evening about the event, following remarks recently made by Silva that he&rsquo;d been knocked out twice during training camp.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 47-year-old Silva said in an interview that was released this week &mdash; but reportedly actually took place a month ago &mdash; that he&rsquo;d been knocked out twice in sparring leading up to the fight, and the Arizona commission told ESPN&rsquo;s Marc Raimondi that they will &ldquo;review additional documentation submitted&rdquo; by Silva</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva has said he &ldquo;misspoke&rdquo; in the interview, noting that English is not his first language, and also that he was joking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a misspoken joke could threaten what is a major money event for himself, Paul, and Showtime Sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most likely outcome, just at a wager, is that the fight will go on unless Silva &mdash; or Paul, for that matter &mdash; failed a medical examination from the commission. It would seem pretty hard to prove that he wasn&rsquo;t simply joking or that he didn&rsquo;t just use the wrong words. But it&rsquo;s a situation where the commission have to at least review the issue officially, too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the fight does happen &mdash; and we&rsquo;ll know by tonight if it&rsquo;s going ahead or not, with the official weigh-in set for tomorrow morning &mdash; then the fight is on!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, time for the other item. Anna&rsquo;s family, and little brother&rsquo;s specifically, are big time Eagle&rsquo;s fans, and the Philadelphia Eagles are doing incredibly well this year. They&rsquo;re undefeated at the moment, with a perfect 6-0 record. They also just traded for a talented, and veteran defensive lineman in Robert Quinn. According to The MMQB's Albert Breer, the Bears are picking up $7.1 million of Quinn's remaining salary for this season. In turn, the Eagles will pay Quinn a shade over $700,000 for the duration of the campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quinn, 32, has had a quiet season for the Bears, posting one sack, three quarterback hits and eight tackles in seven games. It's a far cry from his 2021 season when he notched 18.5 sacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dating back to 2018, however, Quinn has rotated mediocre sack totals with big seasons:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018: 6.5 sacks in 16 games</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019: 11.5 sacks in 14 games</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020: Two sacks in 15 games</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021: 18.5 sacks in 16 games</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depth on the edge became a major need for the Eagles after Derek Barnett was lost for the season with a torn ACL in September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But folks it gets better&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next four quarterbacks the Eagles are scheduled to face have 12 career wins.T</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have 49 touchdowns and 41 interceptions, lifetime passer ratings ranging from 66.7 to 87.0 three wins this year and three career wins over winning teams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Steelers, Texans, Commanders and Colts continue with their current starting quarterbacks, the undefeated Eagles over the next four weeks will face rookie Kenny Pickett, who&rsquo;s thrown two TDs and seven INTs in his first three career starts; Davis Mills, who&rsquo;s won three of 17 career starts; Taylor Heinicke, who&rsquo;s played for three fewer NFL teams (five) than career wins (eight); and Sam Ehlinger, a 6th-round pick who&rsquo;s never thrown an NFL pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, yes, the Eagles appear to be wins over Pickett, Mills, Heinicke and Ehlinger away from a 10-0 record. This coming off a win over Cooper Rush in his sixth career start.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those quarterbacks will be facing a pass defense that through seven weeks is No. 1 in the NFL opposing passer rating and yards allowed and No. 2 in completion percentage and sacks.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Part Two. When it comes to Bible prophecy, we are often playing on a chessboard that&rsquo;s been set up by a group of competitors and with pieces that can move only in terms of their rules. This means that before there can be a discussion of any type of millennialism, there must be an evaluation of passages that seemingly discount each one. The prophetic board must be swept clean before any of the so-called millennial positions can be discussed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of employees leave Twitter for jobs with Meta, Google as Musk deal approaches</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter employees are leaving at rates not seen before as a result of Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk's takeover, Business Insider reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several hundred employees have left the media giant in 2022, with 530 leaving in the last three months. Many have left to competitors such as Meta and Google, the outlet reports</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may not be bad news for Musk, however, as the multibillionaire reportedly has intentions of cutting staff by up to 75 percent, according to a report. Musk is set to close the deal on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk offered to buy Twitter in April but then sought to end the acquisition a few months later, which resulted in a legal battle between him and the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Musk announced he would go through with the original offer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Delaware Court of Chancery has given Musk until Oct. 28 to close the deal, otherwise, the matter will go to trial in November.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Fox News, on Tesla&rsquo;s earnings call last week, Musk said he was "excited about the Twitter situation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-mortgage-interest-rates-jump-716-highest-since-2001-2022-10-26/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-mortgage-interest-rates-jump-716-highest-since-2001-2022-10-26/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. mortgage interest rates jump to 7.16%, highest since 2001</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan rose to its highest level since 2001 as tightening financial conditions weigh on the housing sector, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) showed on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose by 22 basis points to 7.16% for the week ended Oct. 21 while the MBA's Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, fell 1.7% from a week earlier. Mortgage application activity is at its slowest pace since 1997.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage rates have more than doubled since the beginning of the year, as the Federal Reserve pursues an aggressive path of interest rate hikes to rein in stubbornly high inflation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank is expected to raise rates by 75 basis points for a fourth straight time at the conclusion of its next policy meeting on Nov. 1-2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those actions, designed to cool the economy sufficiently to curb price pressures, have weighed heavily on the interest-rate-sensitive housing sector as expectations for Fed tightening have led to a surge in Treasury yields.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The yield on the 10-year note acts as a benchmark for mortgage rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warns-most-covid-related-deaths-this-year-result-people-not-being-updated-their-vaccines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warns-most-covid-related-deaths-this-year-result-people-not-being-updated-their-vaccines</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden warns most COVID-related deaths this year will be result of people not being updated on their vaccines</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden on Tuesday warned the American people that nearly every COVID-related death this year will be because people have not received the updated vaccine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also called on Congress to provide the billions of dollars the administration has requested to buy additional vaccines, tests and treatments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president&rsquo;s comments come ahead of the holiday season when the weather is colder and more people are spending time indoors and contagious viruses are more likely to spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden pointed to new variants in the U.S. and a rise in hospitalizations in Europe and urged people to get the latest vaccine and the flu shot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this year found that more than 75% of COVID-19 deaths in fully vaccinated people had occurred among those with at least four comorbidities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden twice tested positive for COVID-19 in July, despite being fully vaccinated and twice boosted. His physician said the president&rsquo;s rare "rebound" positivity followed treatment with PAXLOVID.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the press conference, Biden rolled up his sleeve and got his updated COVID-19 booster shot from a member of the White House medical unit. He had to delay getting his booster, in accordance with federal health guidance, because of his infection over the summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 20 million people, including nearly 1 in 5 older adults, have gotten the updated COVID-19 booster, the White House said. The vaccine has been reformulated to target the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of omicron, the most dominant strains in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-darrell-brooks-found-guilty-of-intentional-homicide?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-darrell-brooks-found-guilty-of-intentional-homicide?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darrell Brooks found guilty of intentional homicide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday morning, the jury found Darrell Brooks guilty of six counts of intentional homicide, 61 counts of reckless endangerment, six counts of hit and run, two counts of bail jumping, and one count of battery in connection to the Waukesha Christmas parade last year, where Brooks drove his SUV through the crowd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks was found guilty of all charges. A hearing regarding sentencing will begin on Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While waiting for the jury to be brought out, Brooks once again stated that he "does not consent" to be called his legal name, and brought up "subject matter jurisdiction," stating that it has not been addressed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks continued on to list of a number of requests, which Dorow acknowledged, but denied.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the nearly month-long trial, Brooks has argued with Dorow on a multitude of points, causing interruptions which in many cases resulted in Brooks being moved to a neighboring courtroom to listen in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 21, 2021, Brooks drove through the Waukesha Christmas parade, killing six people, including members of the Dancing Grannies group which were marching in the parade, as well as children. More than 60 people were injured in the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks was soon after identified as the suspect in the parade attack, after police discovered the red Ford Explorer seen plowing into the parade parked not far from the scene of the crime with damage to the front end of the vehicle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the Reddit post, Brooks has attempted to have the charges against him thrown out because of a reported recall on his model year of vehicle regarding the throttle body. Brooks said that a class action lawsuit has been filed alleging that the vehicle can speed up without warning due to a malfunction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks brought up this point during the last days of his trial, with Dorow dismissing Brook&rsquo;s requests, stating, "I've made my decision. I expect that you respect the decision at least as we are not going to debate it further."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks has also attempted to state that he is a "sovereign citizen," therefore not subject to the jurisdiction of the government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dorow called Brooks&rsquo; declaration of being a sovereign citizen an "obstructionist tactic."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So again, Brooks was found guilty of all charges. A hearing regarding sentencing will begin on Monday.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubio canvasser attack: 2nd suspect arrested, police say he confronted victim for being Republican</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police in Hialeah, Florida, have arrested a second suspect for an alleged assault on a canvasser for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., that took place Sunday night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an arrest affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital, Jonathan Alexander Casanova joined Javier Lopez in attacking the canvasser. The document also noted that the canvasser told police that Casanova told him he could not pass through the area because he was a Republican.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"After tirelessly working to bring justice to the victim, Hialeah Police Detectives have arrested and charged Jonathan Alexander Casanova for the attack which occurred on Sunday, October 23, 2022," Sgt. Jose Torres said in a statement to Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrest affidavit says that the victim &ndash; who has since been identified by local media as Chris Monzon &ndash; was walking in the neighborhood handing out fliers for Rubio and Gov. Ron DeSantis when Casanova and Lopez were blocking the sidewalk. Following an argument, the affidavit says, Lopez "rushed the victim and threw him on the ground," and then Casanova "began to kick the victim on the head as he was on the ground." While Casanova kicked him, Lopez punched Monzon in the head, police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The affidavit says a witness then pulled Casanova off of Monzon, and then Casanova released two German shepherds from his car and walked with them over to Monzon, who was on the ground, and "began to give commands to the dogs to attack and bite" him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police document says neighbors eventually separated everyone involved, but Casanova fled before officers arrived at the scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The affidavit says that Lopez identified Casanova to police and that Monzon later identified Casanova via a photo line-up. Monzon also provided a sworn statement on video, which is when he said Casanova told him he could not pass because he is a Republican and threatened to have his dogs attack him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monzon said in the statement that he tried to walk around Casanova and Lopez but that Casanova then told him he was not allowed to walk around the neighborhood and threatened to shoot him if he continued. Monzon then said he was on public property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubio's tweet also said that the alleged attackers said Republicans were not allowed in their neighborhood. Initially, police said they had not determined if the attack was politically motivated, and Lopez's arrest affidavit did not mention any remarks about political parties.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guys, I don&rsquo;t really have much in sports for you today&hellip; maybe who do you guys have in the world series this year?

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On today&rsquo;s &lsquo;live&rsquo; episode Tom unpacks insights from John Rist's book: <em>What is a Person?</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>After noting the rich conception of the human person which arose out of classical realist and Christian theological sources, which supplied a robust view of the unique gift and dignity of each human made in the image of God, called by the Gospel to eternal communion with God, Rist then notes the rise of philosophical and political elites who rejected the transcendent vision of Christianity, and embraced philosophies which undercut the personhood of human beings, to the point that apart from themselves, elites began to promote visions which saw the bulk of human beings as inferiors and dependent on their lies for their own safety and survival. Glenn and Chris bring into the discussion many fascinating insights, and all three recognize the elitist agenda continues today, often out in the open.</p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-new-york-city-ordered-by-court-to-reinstate-all-those-fired-over-covid-vaccine-mandates?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-new-york-city-ordered-by-court-to-reinstate-all-those-fired-over-covid-vaccine-mandates?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City ordered by court to reinstate all those fired over Covid vaccine mandates</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the New York Supreme Court ruled that New York City must reinstate all employees that were fired because of their vaccination status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order also states that for those fired, backpay must be issued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit was filed against the City of New York, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the New York Department of Sanitation, Commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene David Chokshi, and New York City Mayor Eric Adams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Though vaccination should be encouraged, public employees should not have been terminated for their noncompliance," the court stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Based upon the Petitioners&rsquo; vague denials of their exemptions, the fact they were kept at full duty for several months while their exemptions were pending, the Mayor&rsquo;s Executive Order granting exemptions to certain classes of people, and the lifting of the private sector mandate, this Court finds the Commissioners Orders of October 20, 2021, and December 13, 2021, as well as the Mayor&rsquo;s Executive Order No. 62 to be arbitrary and capricious," the court ruled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petitioners of the suit are former Department of Sanitation employees that were terminated from their positions in February 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petitioners argued that Adam&rsquo;s Executive Order No. 62, which provided exemptions for athletes, performers, and other artists, "rendered the public employee vaccination mandate arbitrary and capricious or unconstitutional."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court noted that all but one of the petitioners applied for exemptions, and questioned why the city could not keep its vaccine or test policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court did not argue against issuing temporary vaccination mandates in a public health emergency, but added, "however, ordering and enforcing that vaccination policy on only a portion of the populace for an indefinite period of time, is akin to legislating."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court also stated, "being vaccinated does not prevent an individual from contracting or transmitting Covid-19. As of the day of this Decision, CDC guidelines regarding quarantine and isolation are the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Petitioners should not have been terminated for choosing not to protect themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have learned through the course of the pandemic that the vaccine against Covid-19 is not absolute. breakthrough cases occur, even for those who have been vaccinated and boosted. President Joseph Biden has said that the pandemic is over. The State of New York ended the Covid-19 state of emergency over a month ago," the court said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary Clinton already accusing &lsquo;right-wing extremists&rsquo; of stealing 2024 election</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1583496354734538756"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1583496354734538756</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a video posted to social media accused "right-wing extremists" of having "a plan to literally steal the next presidential election."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video was posted by an organization called Indivisible which claims on its website to be "a grassroots movement of thousands of local Indivisible groups with a mission to elect progressive leaders, rebuild our democracy, and defeat the Trump agenda."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failed presidential candidate has repeatedly questioned the results of the 2016 election.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Clinton said that Russian President Vladimir Putin helped to rig the 2016 election against her in an interview on MSNBC. "Putin is the great disrupter. He has a clear mission to undermine democracies, first and foremost, the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost immediately after the statement, Clinton also claimed that anyone who disputed the results of the 2020 election was working for the Kremlin, either directly or indirectly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the organization's website, "Indivisible was founded in response to Trump&rsquo;s election - but we know that Trump is a symptom of a sick democracy, not its cause. We face two fundamental problems: first, our democracy was rigged from the start in favor of the white and wealthy."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups added, "in the last few decades, an alliance of white nationalists and the ultra-rich have been actively working to further undermine democracy and cement their hold on power permanently. That&rsquo;s how we ended up with Trump. We have to build a democracy that reflects a broad, multiracial &ldquo;we the people,&rdquo; one that works for all of us and is sustained by all of us. Only then will we be able to achieve a progressive vision for our future."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group has its own 501c3, 501c4, and PAC.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk May Close Twitter Deal by Friday</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk has pledged to close his $44 billion Twitter Inc. deal by Friday in a video conference call with bankers who are helping fund the deal, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banks have finished putting together the final credit agreement and are in the process of signing the documentation, according to the report, in one of the last steps in moving funds to Musk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter and Musk's lawyers were not immediately available for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk has pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covers the $44 billion price tag and closing costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp., have committed to provide $13 billion of debt financing to support the deal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity investors, including Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, will pitch in with $7.1 billion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Even Green Energy Execs Are Buying Biden&rsquo;s Offshore Wind Plan</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind energy executives are skeptical of the Biden administration&rsquo;s plan to significantly expand offshore wind power in the next several years due to rising costs and the slow permitting of offshore leases, according to the Financial Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration aims to grow U.S. offshore wind generation from less than 1 gigawatt currently to 30 gigawatts by the end of 2030 as part of its aggressive green energy transition, according to a White House fact sheet. However, wind executives are concerned that the administration&rsquo;s target is too ambitious as projects are constantly delayed by a permitting bottleneck and expensive leases, the FT reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various energy projects including offshore wind developments face difficulties in receiving correct permitting from the government, which delays construction and increases costs, according to the FT. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia proposed a permitting bill in September that could have accelerated the federal permitting of key wind, solar and fossil fuel projects; however, the measure was pulled from a recent government funding bill after it failed to gain sufficient support in the Senate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchin&rsquo;s bill would have also given the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) more power to expedite the permitting of transmission lines that transport electricity produced by offshore wind and other renewables to urban areas. Roughly 77 gigawatts of offshore wind are awaiting transmission, according to the Department of Energy&rsquo;s August wind energy report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executives also claim prices of federal leases for offshore wind developments are too high, which makes it difficult for wind developers to make profits, the FT reported. The federal New York Bight offshore wind auction, which offered six lease areas totaling over 488,000 acres, received $4.37 billion total in winning bids, representing the nation&rsquo;s highest-grossing competitive offshore energy lease sale in history, according to an Interior Department press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Border Patrol Numbers Show an Alarming Number of Terrorists Entering the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New numbers released in a calculated, late Friday night news dump over the weekend show an alarming and increasing number of suspected terrorists are entering the United States through the southern border with Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the data, Border Patrol agents have encountered 98 suspected terrorists in fiscal year 2022. In 2021, that number was 15. In 2020, it was three and in 2019, zero.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Terrorist Screening Dataset (TSDS) &ndash; also known as the &ldquo;watchlist&rdquo; &ndash; is the U.S. government&rsquo;s database that contains sensitive information on terrorist identities. The TSDS originated as the consolidated terrorist watchlist to house information on known or suspected terrorists (KSTs) but has evolved over the last decade to include additional individuals who represent a potential threat to the United States, including known affiliates of watchlisted individuals," U.S. Customs and Border Protection explains.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current number only includes suspected terrorists who were caught, not the number embedded in the estimated one million illegal aliens who evaded law enforcement while entering the country and disappearing into American communities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Congressman Andy Biggs, who represents Arizona's 5th Congressional District, is sounding the alarm about the increase.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WNBA's Brittney Griner to serve 9-year term in Russian penal colony after losing appeal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Russian court upheld the nine-year prison sentence for American basketball player Brittney Griner on Tuesday for drug possession. Griner appeared via video at the Moscow Regional Court from a penal colony outside the city, where she is imprisoned and will remain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griner was convicted on August 4 after police found vape canisters containing cannabis oil at the Moscow airport where she landed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griner's appeal was rejected after a ruling on Tuesday to uphold the sentence. The ruling did state that Griner will have time served in prison with her pre-trial detention now being included in her sentence, with each day of pre-trial detention being counted as 1.5 days in prison. Griner will thus have to serve around eight years in a Russian prison, reports AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griner's arrest came as tensions were high between Russia and the United States and just days before Moscow made the call to send troops to Ukraine. Griner played basketball in a Russian women's league during the WNBA's off-season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griner said that she packed the canisters accidentally and that she was prescribed cannabis for pain. She pleaded guilty to the charge. Griner's sentence of 9 years was close to the maximum of 10, with her legal team saying that the punishment was excessive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even NBA star Steph Curry got in on the action in Brittany&rsquo;s defense:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House told reporters following her conviction that they were aggressively pursuing every avenue to bring home Griner to the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that negotiations between the Biden administration and Russia to bring Griner home remain ongoing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, there were reports that the Biden administration offered to exchange a convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for the release of Griner and Pail Whelan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Has Only 25 Days of Diesel Supply; Shortage Could Cripple Economy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States is down to 25 days of diesel supply as a top White House official declared the stockpile levels to be &ldquo;unacceptably low.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data provided by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) show that diesel stockpiles are at their lowest level for October in records that date back to 1993, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. EIA data show that the United States, as of Oct. 14, has 25.4 days of supply&mdash;down from 34.2 days of supply four weeks prior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, a top adviser to President Joe Biden, told Bloomberg News last week that current diesel levels are &ldquo;unacceptably&rdquo; low and that &ldquo;all options are on the table&rdquo; to increase supplies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diesel crunch comes just over two weeks before the November 2022 midterm elections and will likely drive up prices even more. Diesel is the fuel used by freight trains and commonly used by long-haul truckers to transport goods and food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices, meanwhile, remain relatively elevated, according to AAA data. The average price for a gallon of diesel stands at around $5.33 nationwide, or up nearly $2 since the same time in 2021, the data shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale diesel prices at the New York spot market spiked last week to more than $200 per barrel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes as the Biden administration recently announced it would release another 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, part of the 180 million Biden authorized in March, that Republicans say is a bid to keep Democrats politically afloat ahead of the midterms. But Biden and his allies say that it&rsquo;s not a political tactic, and the administration says it will refill the reserve when prices drop to $67&ndash;$72 per barrel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden On His Fitness For Office: &lsquo;I Could Drop Dead Tomorrow&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden (D) responded to questions about his age and fitness for office during an interview that aired Sunday morning by saying that he could &ldquo;drop dead tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden made the remarks during an MSNBC interview with Jonathan Capehart when he was asked what he would say to convince voters to stick with him if he were to run again in 2024.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU to Gift $18 Billion to Ukraine Next Year, the Rest Will Come From U.S</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke after the 27 national EU leaders discussed supporting Ukraine during the second day of their summit in Brussels on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the EU has so far sent $19 billion to Ukraine this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Von der Leyen said the EU would finance 1.5 billion euros per month, with the rest expected to come from the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a video link, Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the EU leaders saying Russian missiles and Iranian drones have damaged a third of Ukraine&rsquo;s energy infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Von der Leyen said the EU was looking to help Ukraine re-establish water, power and electricity supplies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelensky asked the EU for air and missile defence systems and called for &ldquo;new powerful&rdquo; sanctions on Russia and Iran for supplying drones in Moscow&rsquo;s war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland and the three Baltic states proposed banning diamond imports from Russia and phasing out the steel trade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Hungary opposed sanctions against Russia, while Germany and France have said current measures already go far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelensky appealed for more aid pledges to be made at an international conference in Berlin next Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Council President Charles Michel, the summit&rsquo;s chairman, said the EU was looking at using Russian assets frozen under sanctions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that seizing assets amounted to some 300 billion euros, while Berlin and others have warned it might be illegal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kallas also sided with Lithuania for a possible international tribunal to judge possible war crimes committed in Ukraine.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ex-Minneapolis police officer Kueng pleads guilty in George Floyd killing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Minneapolis police officer pleaded guilty on Monday to aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in the May 2020 killing of George Floyd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alexander Kueng&rsquo;s guilty plea will allow one count of aiding and abetting second-degree murder to be dismissed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kueng had helped to restrain Floyd, who was handcuffed and knelt on his back during the May 25, 2020, killing that was recorded on video.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is the second officer to plead guilty to the state charge. Thomas Lane earlier pleaded guilty to the same count. Their former colleague, Tou Thao, is still scheduled to face trial this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three have already been convicted on federal counts of willfully violating the civil rights of Floyd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lane was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in the federal case. Kueng was sentenced to three years and Thao was sentenced to 3 1/2 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officer Derek Chauvin has already been convicted of state murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd&rsquo;s killing last year and is currently serving 22 1/2 years in the state case. Chauvin had pinned Floyd to the ground with a knee on Floyd&rsquo;s neck as he repeatedly said he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State sentencing guidelines for a person with no criminal record, like Kueng, call for a range from about 3 1/2 years to four years and nine months in prison for second-degree unintentional manslaughter. The presumptive sentence is four years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Kueng had been convicted of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, he would have faced a presumptive 12 1/2 years in prison.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Teen Pleads Guilty in School Shooting That Killed 4 Students</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Michigan teenager on Monday pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism charges in a mass shooting at a high school last year that killed four of his classmates and wounded more than half a dozen other people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethan Crumbley, 16, is accused of opening fire at Oxford High School outside Detroit on Nov. 30 with a handgun that his father purchased for him as a Christmas gift days before the massacre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two boys, aged 17 and 16, and two girls, aged 17 and 14, were killed while six other students and a teacher were wounded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley, who was a 15-year-old at the time of the shooting, pleaded guilty in Oakland County Circuit Court to a total of 24 charges, including one count of terrorism causing death and four counts of first-degree murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also charged with seven counts of assault with intent to murder and 12 counts of possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He faces life without parole when he is sentenced. A tentative sentencing hearing is scheduled for Feb. 9, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley&rsquo;s lawyers on Monday withdrew an insanity defense notice that they had previously filed with the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crumbley&rsquo;s parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, also face involuntary manslaughter charges connected to the shooting. In that case, Rochester District Court Judge Julie Nicholson said evidence showed they had purchased a gun for their son despite signs that he was a &ldquo;troubled young man.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case appears to be the first in the United States in which the parents of a teenage school shooter have been charged with crimes attributed to their child. They have pleaded not guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four days before the shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneil Dariush drops Mateusz Gamrot late, secures unanimous decision victory</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneil Dariush continued his winning ways at UFC 280 while vanquishing Mateusz Gamrot, who had quickly become one of the most talked about lightweights in the promotion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showcasing incredible takedown defense combined with a punishing style on the feet, Dariush never slowed down over all rounds as he continued to hammer Gamrot with strikes. Late in the third round, Dariush clubbed Gamrot with a huge overhand left that helped him secure the victory as he notched his eighth victory in a row in arguably the toughest division in the sport.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defining strike came with just over a minute remaining as Dariush leveled Gamrot with a huge overhand left. Gamrot dropped to the ground before diving for another takedown to stave off a potential finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the knockdown was the biggest strike in the fight as Dariush put on another stellar showcase while competing against a less established product in Gamrot. With the win, Dariush moves that much closer to title contention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one of the best parts for me came in Dariush&rsquo;s post fight interview.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7q0-Ypk7_HE"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Beneil Dariush Octagon Interview | UFC 280&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/7q0-Ypk7_HE&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Beneil Dariush Octagon Interview | UFC 280</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play 0:00-1:10</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I want to praise Dariush here, is because he&rsquo;s praising Jesus Christ in an area of the world where Islam is the dominant religion currently. Eventually it won&rsquo;t be, but for the time being, this was a bold statement in the United Emirates.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Broadcasting from John's house--but the Peaches forgot to pack the headphones. So, we can't hear anything we're producing. Hopefully it sounds okay.&nbsp;<br /><br />John just got back from doing a comedy show for less than 30 people. This leads us to discuss the way audience size (and location) affects the way we talk.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does that mean we're being inauthentic or two-faced because we alter our style for different occassions?&nbsp;<br /><br />Pull up a chair at the table!<br /><br />Visit johnbranyan.com to join the Comedy Clique and support The Comedian Next Door.&nbsp; We're going on VACATION in July 2023, and we want you to come with us.

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/hunter-bidens-laptop-documents-at-least-459-legal-violations-watchdog-group-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/hunter-bidens-laptop-documents-at-least-459-legal-violations-watchdog-group-says</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter Biden&rsquo;s Laptop Documents At Least 459 Legal Violations, Watchdog Group Says</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year-long exploration of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop has yielded a 630-page report that its authors say document 459 violations of state and federal laws and regulations by President Joe Biden&rsquo;s son and his business partners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marco Polo, a nonprofit formed by a one-time aide to former President Trump to enable a team&nbsp; to take a deep dive into the laptop that the&nbsp; crack-addled Biden left at a Delaware repair store, claims the report is a road map for local, state, or federal prosecutors to pursue charges. The group also sent its report to each member of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timing of the report&rsquo;s release, coming two weeks before the midterm elections, has a certain symmetry to the laptop&rsquo;s initial introduction to the public. In 2020, days before the election, the New York Post published news of the laptop&rsquo;s existence, as well as bombshells from it, but social media suppressed the story after the FBI had warned companies of so-called misinformation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time around, the timing is similar, but other factors are reversed. Legacy outlets have acknowledged that the laptop&rsquo;s files are authentic, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey admitted that censoring the laptop was a mistake, and the social media platform is being sold to free-speech advocate Elon Musk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, which reviewed the laptop&rsquo;s emails, videos, calendar items, photographs, phone records, financial documents and more, but also provided context and explanation, serves as a &ldquo;Rosetta Stone of white- and blue-collar crime under the patina of &lsquo;the Delaware Way,&rsquo;&rdquo; the report says. &ldquo;We were able to illuminate previously convoluted network webs of the people leading the charge for global governance,&rdquo; cutting through shell companies and middlemen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimes Hunter Biden allegedly committed include serving as an agent for foreign entities without disclosing it, tax fraud, and falsifying business documents. The alleged crimes also include prostitution, non-consensual pornography, and distribution of narcotics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/voters-agree-gop-to-take-house-senate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/voters-agree-gop-to-take-house-senate</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters agree: GOP to take House and Senate</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weeks of reporting that the Republicans are poised to take control of the House, and maybe the Senate, have sunk with voters who now mostly agree that the November elections should show Democrats the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest Rasmussen Reports survey, just shared with Secrets, likely voters expect the Republicans to win control of the House. And it&rsquo;s not even close, with 67% agreeing to 17% who don&rsquo;t. Even 56% of Democrats expect their party to lose control of the House.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Senate, it's closer, with 58% of likely voters believing it&rsquo;s likely the Republicans will edge out the Democrats. Just 25% don&rsquo;t agree. Among Democrats, the split is even, 42% agree and 42% don&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the media have recently raised expectations that the House will turn red by 10-40 seats. There has been some reporting of tightening Senate races that could give the Republicans a 1-2 seat edge after the elections are over on Nov. 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also quizzed likely voters on if they plan to cast ballots early or on Election Day. Most, by a 53%-44% margin, chose Election Day, though that was mostly a GOP preference as with past elections.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former FBI Official Will Testify About White House Pressure to Inflate Domestic Extremism Numbers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee announced on Thursday that they would be calling a former top FBI official to testify before Congress to address claims that the Biden administration pressured agents to label cases as domestic extremism or a white supremacist threat even if they did not meet that criteria in order to match Joe Biden&rsquo;s rhetoric.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, current and former FBI agents came forward claiming the Biden administration has been deliberately exaggerating the danger posed by white supremacists. According to the whistleblowers, high-ranking FBI officials were pressuring field agents to fabricate domestic terrorism cases and label people as white supremacists in order to &ldquo;meet internal metrics.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The demand for white supremacy&rdquo; coming from FBI brass &ldquo;vastly outstrips the supply of white supremacy,&rdquo; one agent told the Washington Times. &ldquo;We have more people assigned to investigate white supremacists than we can actually find.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 2, members of the House Judiciary Committee will interview Jill Sanborn, a former assistant director of the FBI Counterterrorism Division and executive assistant director of its National Security Branch, who has been accused of pressuring agents to reclassify cases per the White House&rsquo;s requests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI claims it only investigates those &ldquo;who commit or intend to commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security&rdquo; and that it does not target individuals or organizations based on their political beliefs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the administration previously came under fire for using the resources of the Department of Justice to target angry parents at school board meetings and treat them like domestic terrorists. Merrick Garland authorized the FBI to investigate parents who protested school board meetings alleging a &ldquo;disturbing trend&rdquo; of teachers being threatened or harassed. However, PJ Media&rsquo;s Megan Fox looked into those allegations and concluded that they&rsquo;re mostly bunk.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona Refuses to Comply With Biden Demand to Remove Makeshift Border Wall</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona&rsquo;s Department of Emergency and Military Affairs is refusing a demand by the Biden administration to remove the shipping containers they are using to close gaps in the wall at the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A letter written to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and signed by Allen Clark, Director of Arizona&rsquo;s DEMA, states &ldquo;the containers will remain in place until specific details regarding construction are provided.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark goes on to argue that the residents of Arizona &ldquo;cannot rely on the federal government to ensure its security.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The myriad of federal agencies that claim jurisdiction on the southern border but do nothing to prevent the public nuisance caused by illegal immigration and criminal activity that exploits the open border is quite frustrating to those that live, work and recreate on that border and in our state,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter comes in response to a demand by the Biden administration to remove the shipping containers that are predominantly being used to seal up gaps in the border wall near Yuma.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation penned its own letter last week claiming Arizona&rsquo;s shipping containers are trespassing on its lands and those of the Cocopah Indian Tribe&rsquo;s West Reservation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bureau indicates contracts have been awarded to close the gaps in question and they &lsquo;anticipate&rsquo; awarding more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, they insisted the containers be removed so the project can continue &ldquo;without unnecessary delay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona Republican Governor Doug Ducey issued an executive order to seal up gaps in the border wall in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meaning the White House had no less than 18 months to get those contracts awarded and pushed out to start construction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shipping containers stand 22 feet high, are welded together, and feature an additional four feet of razor wiring added to the top.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ducey&rsquo;s reasoning behind installing the containers includes the Biden administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;lack of urgency on border security,&rdquo; which he labeled a &ldquo;dereliction of duty.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/10/nascar-suspends-bubba-wallace-after-intentionally-wrecking-kyle-larson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/10/nascar-suspends-bubba-wallace-after-intentionally-wrecking-kyle-larson/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASCAR Suspends Bubba Wallace After Intentionally Wrecking Kyle Larson</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASCAR announced they suspended Bubba Wallace one race for his actions at Las Vegas Motor Speedway where he deliberately retaliated against Kyle Larson on the track.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the South Point 400, Larson had a strong run going into turn 3 and he dove to the inside of both Kevin Harvick and Bubba Wallace. Harvick got out of the gas and let Larson and Wallace race for the position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they continued into turn four, Larson got loose and began to chase his car up the track inching ever close to Wallace. However, he never made contact with Wallace. Coming off the turn, Wallace slammed into the outside wall hard, bounced off it and down into Larson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larson dove to the inside of the track to avoid Wallace. Wallace believing Larson had wronged him by chasing his car up the track chased him down the track and ran into his right rear quarter panel sending both cars spinning up the track. Larson would make contact with Christopher Bell before making contact with the wall. Wallace would smash nose first into the outside wall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASCAR.com reports Wallace violated &ldquo;Sections 4.3A and 4.4 C &amp; E of the NASCAR Member Code of Conduct laid out in the NASCAR Rule Book. Rule 4.4.C lists &ldquo;intentionally wrecking or spinning another vehicle, whether or not that vehicle is removed from Competition as a result&rsquo; as one of five member actions that could result in a penalty.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, NASCAR chose to suspend Wallace one race. NASCAR&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer Steve O&rsquo;Donnell appeared on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio to explain the decision.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/10/nhl-embraces-anti-white-racism-says-they-have-too-many-white-employees-aims-to-change-that/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2022/10/nhl-embraces-anti-white-racism-says-they-have-too-many-white-employees-aims-to-change-that/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NHL Embraces Anti-White Racism, Says They Have Too Many White Employees, Aims To Change That</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Hockey League (NHL) released a workforce demographic study as part of a report on &ldquo;Accelerating Diversity &amp; Inclusion&rdquo; that claims the organization&rsquo;s teams are too white and the league plans to make changes to reduce the percentage of white people that work for them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing the report, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman made clear the organization&rsquo;s goals saying, &ldquo;Our belief is stronger than ever that hockey has a powerful platform to build character, teach life skills, and support our society and our communities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of one of their initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion, the report notes, &ldquo;The NHL developed a new, best-in-class Workforce Demographic Study to understand the diversity of full-time League and Club employees and accelerate inclusive hiring.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Workforce Demographic Study was also highlighted as one of the NHL&rsquo;s 7 Dimensions, specifically under their Employment section. This section specifically notes the NHL is engaging in racist activities, &ldquo;Data from the survey will help guide future decision-making about our workforce. In late 2021, the NHL hired a full-time Director of Recruiting who is focused on attracting diverse talent to the organization. Additionally, the League engaged Jopwell with the intent of creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace by expanding our talent pool through Jopwell&rsquo;s network of Black, Latinx, and Native American professionals.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report further notes they will be excluding white people from a mentorship program, &ldquo;Clubs are also taking action: 22 Clubs have launched or are about to launch a mentorship/fellowship/hiring program to develop BIPOC and female talent to work in the organization&rsquo;s Hockey Operations or front office roles.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC moves to add Covid vaccine to child immunization schedule for federal programs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is set to vote on whether or not to include the Covid vaccine in their recommended schedule of shots for children and teens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to meet on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss, amongst other topics, whether to include the Covid vaccines and other vaccinations into their child and adolescent immunization schedule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to WBOY, the CDC is considering adding the vaccine to their schedule in order for it to be covered under the federally-funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program and other programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for vaccines to be covered under health plans, shots must be approved by the CDC director, and appear on the CDC&rsquo;s immunization schedule, according to a document from the CDC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CDC, VFC is a federally funded program that provides vaccines to children at no cost to families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC&rsquo;s immunization schedule for kids is seen as a recommendation for parents and physicians on when certain vaccines should be administered. The schedule also serves as a building block for school districts nationwide, many of whom chose to follow these guidelines as requirements for children to enter public schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inclusion of the Covid-19 vaccine on this schedule could give the green signal for school districts to enforce mandates on their students, with some schools across the country pausing their mandates over low vaccination numbers in minors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many European nations have said that Covid vaccines are not necessary for children.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/abc-news-investigative-producer-disappears-after-fbi-raid?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/abc-news-investigative-producer-disappears-after-fbi-raid?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC News investigative producer disappears after FBI raid, was working on book about Biden&rsquo;s Afghanistan withdrawal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An award-winning ABC News national security investigative producer has seemingly gone missing following an FBI raid on his home in April for unclear reasons. James Gordon Meek was in the process of writing a book on the Biden administration's controversial withdrawal from Afghanistan when his neighbors spotted armored vehicles outside of his home, and he hasn't been heard from since.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meek, 52, was best known for his breaking news stories on high levels of corruption within the US military. His bombshell report of the Army&rsquo;s coverup of the fratricidal death of Pfc. Dave Sharrett II in Iraq landed Meek a meeting with then-President Obama. He seemed to be at the height of his career, with nine years at ABC, a newly-released documentary on Hulu, and a book on the way. That's why so many are baffled at his mysterious and uncharacteristically abrupt disappearance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was on April 27 of this year when police cruisers and unmarked utility vehicles were spotted blocking the street outside of Meek's Arlington, Virginia apartment building, according to a Rolling Stone report. That was around the time of his last online activity, with one last "like" being sent from his Twitter account on May 2. Since then, he's been silent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An FBI representative confirmed that agents were present that morning "at the 2300 block of Columbia Pike, Arlington, Virginia, conducting court-authorized law-enforcement activity."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The FBI cannot comment further due to an ongoing investigation," they said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal magistrate judge signed off on the search warrant the day before the raid. In accordance with a new policy enacted last year, federal prosecutors are not allowed to seize journalists' documents without approval from the Deputy Attorney General, meaning that Biden-appointed Lisa Monaco had to have given her blessing if that's what the raid was for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the bureau's involvement, Meek has not been charged with any crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anonymous sources claimed to Rolling Stone that federal agents found classified information on Meek's laptop, but the contents of said information are unknown at this time. His lawyer, Eugene Gorokhov, responded to the claims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mr. Meek is unaware of what allegations anonymous sources are making about his possession of classified documents. If such documents exist, as claimed, this would be within the scope of his long career as an investigative journalist covering government wrongdoing. The allegations in your inquiry are troubling for a different reason: they appear to come from a source inside the government. It is highly inappropriate, and illegal, for individuals in the government to leak information about an ongoing investigation. We hope that the DOJ [Department of Justice] promptly investigates the source of this leak."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, no comment on where exactly his client is.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacey Abrams suggests having an abortion as solution to inflation: 'Economic realities of having a child'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was criticized on Wednesday after suggesting that having an abortion could be a solution to high inflation and claiming that "having children" is why people are worried about the price of gas and groceries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1582726622859624449"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1582726622859624449</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:00-1:32</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams made her remarks a day after President Biden pledged that if Democrats keep control of Congress, he will codify in January the federal right to abortion once granted by the recently overturned Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At no point during the speech did the president, who was a freshman senator nearly 50 years ago when Roe v. Wade was decided in January 1973, mention inflation or the economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rejected a New York Times poll that found voters believe the economy and inflation are the top two issues facing the nation, calling it an &ldquo;outlier.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams said at the end of September that there was "no such thing" as a fetal heartbeat at 6-weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fake News: Zelensky&rsquo;s Famous Quote of &lsquo;Need Ammunition, Not a Ride&rsquo; Never Happened</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A senior official claims that a famous quote by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky appears to be fake news, war propaganda.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quote about needing ammunition helped catapult his credentials as a defiant wartime leader.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revelation came amidst a sprawling report by the New Yorker on the Biden administration&rsquo;s support for Ukraine, which is far more extensive than previously known and includes operational planning at the highest levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Zelensky&rsquo;s famous line &ndash; &ldquo;I need ammunition, not a ride&rdquo; &ndash; and the fact that it may have been completely fabricated and promoted by the media ad nauseam casts a further pall on a war narrative that has at times seemed crafted by the heavy hand of a former actor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the New Yorker:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days into the invasion, the Associated Press reported that Zelensky had rejected a U.S. offer to evacuate him from Kyiv, saying, &ldquo;I need ammunition, not a ride.&rdquo; A senior U.S. official said, &ldquo;To the best of my knowledge, that never happened.&rdquo; The official added, &ldquo;But hats off to Zelensky and the people around him. It was a great line.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;re searching for evidence that the American media are perfectly fine with helping to perpetuate falsehoods in the war effort in Ukraine, you need look no further than the Washington Post and fact-checker Glenn Kessler.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kessler analyzed the claim that Zelensky had uttered the quote: &ldquo;I need ammunition, not a ride.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he admitted the claim was not easily verifiable, he concluded using Zelensky&rsquo;s press secretary that &ldquo;the quote, even if not accurate, reflects the moment.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least he tried. The rest of the media simply ran with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn&rsquo;t the first time stories coming out of Ukraine had proven to be completely orchestrated in an effort to drum up emotional support from the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time as the Zelensky &lsquo;ammunition&rsquo; quote, a story was developing about a defiant group of 13 Ukrainian border guards defending Snake Island in the Black Sea who reportedly told a Russian warship to &ldquo;go f*** yourself&rdquo; after being ordered to surrender.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 13 Ukrainian border guards were initially widely reported as killed as the Russian warship opened fire with barreled guns and aircraft bombing Snake Island.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy said during a press briefing that the guards died &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; and even said the 13 would be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was later reported they were still alive and in Russian captivity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, of course, there is the infamous &lsquo;Ghost of Kyiv&lsquo; propaganda promoted by some prominent figures here in the United States. Some, like Rep. Adam Kinzinger, were so willing to believe the story they promoted fake images of a meme-character known as Samuel Hyde.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s breathtaking the number of stories like the Zelensky ammunition fairytale that have been thrust upon the American people as a means to justify the absurd level of financial and military support being offered to Ukraine at our expense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News host Tucker Carlson has seemingly had enough, eviscerating Zelensky for making further outrageous demands for financial aid while the United States economy, and the American people, are suffering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1580717198703611904"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1580717198703611904</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Zelenskyy is now shaking down our cowardly Congress for more cash at the very moment our own economy and our own borders are collapsing,&rdquo; Carlson added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Saint Andrews:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&rsquo;s culture shifts like sand. But New Saint Andrews College is established on Christ, the immovable rock. It is a premier institution that forges evangelical leaders who don&rsquo;t fear or hate the world. Guided by God&rsquo;s Word, they take the world back because they&rsquo;re equipped with the genius of classical liberal arts and God-honoring wisdom, thanks to a faculty dedicated to academic rigor and to God&rsquo;s kingdom.Find out more, at nsa.edu/</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With less than three minutes left in overtime, Hopkins hit a 39-yard field goal to give the Chargers the 19-16 win.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did he hit the game winning field goal, but he did while playing with a hamstring injury that he suffered after hitting the first extra point of the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Since we&rsquo;re getting close to Halloween, Glenn brings the topic of witchcraft to the table today. The guys begin by discussing historic ideas of witchcraft and the witch trials of Renaissance and early modern period. Note that some of these beliefs get us into PG-13 territory. The Pugsters then turn to witchcraft in the modern world, discussing Wicca and witchcraft around the world as well as the growing belief in the supernatural among college students. Although the kinds of witches described in witch hunting manuals only existed in the minds of the people of the day, the guys agree that demonic manifestations are very real even if only obvious in some parts of the world today.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dossier.substack.com/p/the-cdc-will-vote-thursday-to-permanently?utm_source=twitter&amp;sd=pf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dossier.substack.com/p/the-cdc-will-vote-thursday-to-permanently?utm_source=twitter&amp;sd=pf</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC will vote Thursday to permanently shield Pfizer and Moderna from COVID vaccine injury liability</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CDC committee will convene this week and likely vote Thursday to deliver permanent legal indemnity to Pfizer and Moderna, through the process of adding the drug companies&rsquo; mRNA injections to the child and adolescent immunization schedules.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By adding the shots to the childhood schedule, the CDC&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will transfer liability for vaccine injuries to the federal government&rsquo;s National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), allowing for Pfizer and Moderna to finally bring an FDA approved shot to the market without opening itself up to lawsuits. Moreover, it will act as another windfall for companies that have already brought in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues, by requiring these vaccinations for children who attend public schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2020, the federal government invoked the PREP Act, which gave Pfizer and Moderna a tort liability shield due to the declared &ldquo;public health emergency,&rdquo; which the government is reportedly going to revoke in early 2023. The companies&rsquo; emergency use authorization shots have since been protected by the federal government through this 2005 congressional action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A draft agenda published by the CDC shows what will be on the schedule for Wednesday and Thursday&rsquo;s meetings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Resources &amp; Services Administration has clarified what needs to happen for a vaccine to become liability free:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For a vaccine to be covered, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must recommend the category of vaccine for routine administration to children or pregnant women, and it must be subject to an excise tax by federal law.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dossier has reported extensively on the coordinated effort by Big Pharma and the Biden Administration to delay the rollout of an FDA approved COVID vaccine, with legal experts suspecting the process is in place to protect Pfizer and Moderna from legal liability from vaccine injuries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once described as the cure to the coronavirus, the novel mRNA shots have resulted in catastrophic failure, with a side effect profile exponentially higher than advertised. Thanks to a fraudulent, deceptive marketing campaign, assisted by top federal officials and high-profile pharmaceutical executives, the drugmakers and the federal government convinced millions of Americans to take shots that were much more dangerous (especially for young men), and much less effective than advertised.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of COVID Mania, Pfizer and Moderna have raked in hundreds of billions of dollars in liability free dollars, enriching their executives and board members beyond their wildest dreams. Thanks to Big Pharma&rsquo;s successful regulatory capture of Government Health, and corrupt bureaucrats&rsquo; willing compliance, it looks like the mRNA drug cartel will be completely off the hook when it comes to compensating the countless Americans who were harmed by their junk products.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden plans to release even more barrels of oil from the federal government&rsquo;s strategic reserves to keep gas prices low before the midterm elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s latest decision marks more than 200 million barrels set for release in less than two years as president, more than all previous presidents combined according to the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Biden&rsquo;s historic oil releases to bring down the cost of gasoline, the OPEC+ nations announced their decision in October to cut oil production by two million barrels a day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president expressed his disappointment with OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s decision, despite administration officials working behind the scenes urging them to delay their cuts until after the midterm elections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden recently campaigned in California where gas prices are nearly seven dollars a gallon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about prices approaching seven dollars a gallon in the state, Biden replied, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s always been the case here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite gas prices rising again, Biden continues taking credit for gas prices declining from record highs in the Summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[A] lot of it is the result of getting the cost of living at the gas pump down by more &mdash; now even in California now &mdash; by more than a dollar nationally and &mdash; since the start of summer,&rdquo; he said during a speech on Americans suffering from higher costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/china-cuts-off-natural-gas-supplies-to-europe-just-in-time-for-winter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/china-cuts-off-natural-gas-supplies-to-europe-just-in-time-for-winter/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China Cuts Off Natural Gas Supplies to Europe, Just in Time for Winter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist China has told state-owned energy-importing companies to cease sending natural gas supplies to European nations already facing a catastrophic winter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bloomberg, the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s National Development and Reform Commission also told the state-owned energy giants CNOOC, PetroChina, and Sinopec to halt shipments of liquified natural gas to foreign buyers in Europe and Asia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China scooped up excess Russian gas since the war in Ukraine, as Europe faces an unprecedented energy crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communist nation has managed to build up an excess of liquified natural gas amid lockdowns to comply with Beijing&rsquo;s zero-Covid agenda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Russia reduced shipments to the European Union in response to the bloc&rsquo;s support of Ukraine and sanctions on Moscow, China began reselling its surplus LNG cargo to the EU at inflated prices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to estimates, some four million tonnes of liquid natural gas was resold by China, which accounts for approximately seven percent of Europe&rsquo;s imports during the same period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese government has not given a specific reason for halting the supply of natural gas supplies on the open market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the move could be an attempt by Xi Jinping to aid his ally Vladimir Putin in putting the squeeze on Europe at a crucial moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite falling gas prices in Europe from their high in August, the European Union is still considering placing a price cap on imported LNG.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia&rsquo;s state-owned Gazprom responded by threatening to cut off all shipments to Europe, forcing the EU to reach out to countries like China selling on the international market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EU globalists have rushed towards their green agenda and forestalled domestic energy production, specifically Germany, which banned fracking for its own natural gas in favor of cleaner alternatives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move, however, has just left the bloc beholden to Russia to meet its energy needs and, ironically, China to meet its green goals &ndash; given that almost all solar panels are made in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the head of the green lobbyist group, admitted: &ldquo;Everybody knows what&rsquo;s going on in China, and when facilities are based there, you have to accept that there&rsquo;s a high possibility that forced labour will be used.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston University Defends Controversial Study on COVID Hybrid Strain With &rsquo;80 Percent&rsquo; Mortality Rate in Mice</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston University issued a statement Tuesday defending its research of a COVID-19 Omicron strain when they took the variant&rsquo;s spike protein and attached it to the original COVID-19 strain, leading to a higher mortality rate in a certain species of mice, triggering concern among lawmakers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Omicron S-bearing virus robustly escapes vaccine-induced humoral immunity, mainly due to mutations in the receptor-binding motif&hellip; while Omicron causes mild, non-fatal infection, the Omicron S-carrying virus inflicts severe disease with a mortality rate of 80 percent,&rdquo; the preprint study said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Emily Erbelding, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&rsquo;s division of microbiology and infectious diseases, told Stat News that the Boston University&rsquo;s grant application didn&rsquo;t specify that researchers wanted to perform this work and the group did not say it was performing experiments to possible enhance a COVID-19 variant. An investigation is now underway, she said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston University issued a lengthy statement defending its research and said critics have misrepresented the goals of the study while refuting allegations that the study involved gain-of-function research, which can make a pathogen more deadly or transmissible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The research was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which consists of scientists as well as local community members,&rdquo; the statement from Boston University said. &ldquo;The Boston Public Health Commission also approved the research. Furthermore, this research mirrors and reinforces the findings of other, similar research performed by other organizations, including the FDA. Ultimately, this research will provide a public benefit by leading to better, targeted therapeutic interventions to help fight against future pandemics.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain reports about the study were &ldquo;false and inaccurate,&rdquo; Boston University official Ronald Corley said in a statement. A report from the Daily Mail, he alleged, took the &ldquo;80 percent&rdquo; line out of context.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report: NASCAR To Review Bubba Wallace&rsquo;s Attack On Kyle Larson At Las Vegas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report claims NASCAR will review Bubba Wallace&rsquo;s attack on Kyle Larson that occurred during the race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for those that never watch NASCAR, myself included, Bubba Wallace was the gentleman who claimed he found a noose in his garage at a NASCAR racetrack, a race baiting move&hellip;&nbsp; but it turned out to be just a regular noose used to open the garage door&hellip; anyways:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the race, Kyle Larson got loose underneath Bubba Wallace, but appeared to save the car. There does not appear to be any contact made between the two drivers at this point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Wallace slammed hard into the wall and bounced down the track into Larson. Larson then dived hard down into the track to avoid Wallace who chased him down the track and purposely clipped Larson in the rear quarter panel sending him spinning up the track into Christopher Bell and the outside wall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&rsquo;s the commentator&rsquo;s take live at the race:</span></p>

I&rsquo;m back at it ladies and gentleman&hellip; I got a tad sick last week which threw off our Daily News Brief schedule last week, but we&rsquo;re good to go this week. Before I dive into the news:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanye West to Buy Parler to Cement Its &lsquo;Uncancelable&rsquo; Status, Protect Conservative Views</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billionaire musician Kanye West is buying Parler, the free speech-championing social media app that rose to prominence amid allegations that rival Twitter was suppressing conservative voices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parler, which bills itself as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s pioneering uncancelable free speech platform,&rdquo; announced the purchase agreement in principle in a press release on Oct. 17, the same day that West joined the service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,&rdquo; West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parler has not disclosed how much West will pay for the platform nor whether the purchase will yield any policy changes, with the deal expected to close by year&rsquo;s end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The proposed acquisition will assure Parler a future role in creating an uncancelable ecosystem where all voices are welcome,&rdquo; Parler said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Farmer, the CEO of Parlement Technologies, the parent company of Parler, welcomed West&rsquo;s involvement in the platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This deal will change the world, and change the way the world thinks about free speech,&rdquo; Farmer said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development comes after West was recently locked out of his Instagram and Twitter accounts after making posts alleged to be anti-Semitic.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/defund-the-police-councilwoman-begs-seattle-police-for-protection-after-poop-thrown-at-her-house?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/defund-the-police-councilwoman-begs-seattle-police-for-protection-after-poop-thrown-at-her-house?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Defund the police' councilwoman begs Seattle Police for protection after 'poop' thrown at her house</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kshama Sawant, the Seattle City Council member who led the charge to defund the police department is now requesting police to protect her home in response to repeated scatological vandalism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources told The Post Millennial that over the past month someone has been throwing human feces at the Marxist councilmember&rsquo;s home. According to the source, the Seattle Police Department responded and took a report, and the councilmember is now requesting a &ldquo;permanent patrol presence monitoring her place from 5 pm -10 pm every day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time the radical councilmember has asked for police protection. In December 2020 following the riots that rocked the city in the wake of the death of George Floyd, Sawant demanded police protection in response to threats. However, it was later revealed that Sawant had used the threats for publicity before contacting the Seattle police.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawant was one of the most vocal members of the defund the police movement in Seattle which led to hundreds of officers leaving the force. Following the defunding movement, crime skyrocketed, and the city is on track to beat last year&rsquo;s record-high number of homicides. Rapes and assaults have also spiked. 911 response times have steadily climbed and many residents reported being placed on hold.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2020 riots, Sawant used her key to let protestors into Seattle City Hall after hours so that the mob could occupy the building which was also closed to the public due to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawant also led a group of rioters during the deadly Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in the councilmember's district to the home of then-Mayor Jenny Durkan, the location of which was protected under confidentiality laws from her time as a US attorney. The rioters vandalized the house during the stunt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Sawant supporting the deadly occupation of six blocks of Seattle, her staff set up tents inside the zone to collect signatures for a ballot initiative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawant's office was not available for comment.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/a-navy-veteran-showed-up-for-jury-duty-the-judge-sent-him-to-jail-for-not-wearing-a-mask"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/a-navy-veteran-showed-up-for-jury-duty-the-judge-sent-him-to-jail-for-not-wearing-a-mask</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Navy Veteran Showed Up For Jury Duty. The Judge Sent Him To Jail For Not Wearing A Mask.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A North Carolina Superior Court judge ordered a prospective juror to spend 24 hours in jail after he refused to wear a mask in the courtroom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Charles Gilchrist is the only judge in the courthouse who enforces a mask mandate after North Carolina Democratic Governor Roy Cooper lifted a statewide mask mandate for most indoor settings over a year ago. Gilchrist found 47-year-old Gregory Hahn of Harnett County in contempt of court for his refusal to follow the judge&rsquo;s mask order, WRAL News reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The irony of all this is the judge was talking to me without a mask,&rdquo; said Hahn, a Navy veteran who reportedly served on the President&rsquo;s Honor Guard at Arlington National Cemetery. &ldquo;If safety was such a concern, I go to jail [with] no mask requirements with inmates.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clerk of Superior Court Renee Whittenton said in a statement that each of the prospective jurors were told of Gilchrist&rsquo;s mask rule when they checked in, and the court provided them with masks if they did not have one, but Hahn said he was not made aware of the mandate, and it was not listed on Hahn&rsquo;s court summons. The courthouse does not have any signs that state masks are required.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A joint order by Harnett and Lee counties from March stated that masks are optional in hallways, foyers, restrooms, meeting rooms, and similar areas, but the order allowed presiding judges to decide whether they wanted a mask mandate in the courtroom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Navy veteran and single father said Gilchrist asked him twice if he was refusing to wear a mask, and Hahn said he was. The judge then reportedly ordered Hahn to spend 24 hours in jail, and he was handcuffed and taken away minutes later. Hahn said he asked Gilchrist if he could call his son who was at home, but the judge refused his request.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9 Million Californians to Partake in Earthquake Drill</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LOS ANGELES&mdash;Millions of people in government offices, businesses, and schools throughout Los Angeles County this week will stop everything for a minute to &ldquo;drop, cover, and hold on&rdquo; during a statewide earthquake preparedness drill, now in its 14th year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great California ShakeOut of 2022 is scheduled for 10:20 a.m. Oct. 20.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What we do to prepare now, before this big earthquake, will determine how well we can survive and recover,&rdquo; according to a statement posted on ShakeOut.org. &ldquo;Great ShakeOut Earthquake drills are annual opportunities to learn and practice earthquake safety with millions of people.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ShakeOut website indicated that 9.2 million Californians are slated to participate in the drill. During last year&rsquo;s event, about 7.6 million statewide registered to take part.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first drill was held in 2008.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Los Angeles County, more than 3.2 million people have registered for this week&rsquo;s drill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Municipalities whose local government employees will be involved include Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pasadena, Burbank, and Santa Clarita.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Los Angeles city and county agencies are also signed up, including Metrolink and Metro, the Los Angeles police and fire departments, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, Los Angeles Public Libraries, and the city departments of Recreation and Parks, Housing, Aging, and General Services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Los Angeles area community colleges and universities will be participating including the Los Angeles Community College District, Santa Monica College, Pasadena City College, UCLA, and USC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of the county&rsquo;s kindergarten through 12th-grade school districts, along with private and charter schools, will have students and staff participating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ShakeOut.org, the objective is to emphasize precautions during a 7.8-magnitude or larger quake along the southernmost portion of the San Andreas fault.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drill in 2019 came just over three months after the early July quakes that struck Ridgecrest. The 6.4- and 7.1-magnitude shakers caused significant damage to roads and structures in the hamlet, which lies just south of the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Californians should be prepared to be self-sufficient for 72 hours following a major disaster. That includes having a first-aid kit, medications, food, and enough water for each member of a household to drink one gallon per day, according to local and state officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners and renters should also know how to turn off the gas in their residences in case of leaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so long ago, the American dream was alive and well. Employees who worked hard were rewarded, and employers looked for people who could do the job, not for people who had the right political views.&nbsp; RedBalloon.work is a job site designed to get us back to what made American businesses successful: free speech, hard work, and having fun.&nbsp; If you are a free speech employer who wants to hire employees who focus on their work and not identity politics, then post a job on RedBalloon.&nbsp; If you are an employee who is being censored at work or is being forced to comply with the current zeitgeist, post your resume on RedBalloon and look for a new job. redballoon.work, the job site where free speech is still alive!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this happened over the weekend: </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ehxfl9K9Jgg"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;#3 Alabama vs #6 Tennessee Highlights (GAME OF THE YEAR) | Week 7 | 2022 College Football Highlights&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/ehxfl9K9Jgg&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">#3 Alabama vs #6 Tennessee Highlights (GAME OF THE YEAR) | Week 7 | 2022 College Football Highlights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;#3 Alabama vs #6 Tennessee Highlights (GAME OF THE YEAR) | Week 7 | 2022 College Football Highlights&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/ehxfl9K9Jgg&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 16:44-17:31</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was one of the best college football games in recent memory for me, as #6 Tennessee took down #3 Alabama 52-49 as the clock hit zero.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, from the west coast, how about this game? </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MNu7j1KCR_I"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;#7 USC vs #20 Utah Football Game Highlights 10 15 2022&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/MNu7j1KCR_I&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">#7 USC vs #20 Utah Football Game Highlights 10 15 2022</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 30:45-31:00</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play 33:22-33:36</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you not be romantic about college football? Utah took down the #7 and undefeated USC Trojans 43-42. Apologies to friend of the show David Bahnsen&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were the two best games of the season thus far in my book, and both on the same weekend no less! But how about some other scores?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#5 Clemson def. FSU 34-28</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4 Michigan def. #10 Penn State 41-17&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#8 TCU def. OK ST 43-40&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tons of undefeated teams came tumbling down this weekend!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly in Baseball, The Padres sent the Dodgers home packing after their Saturday win&hellip; they won the series 3-1. The Astros advanced after sweeping the Mariners. The Phillies defeated the Braves 8-3 to win the series 3-1. The Yankees and the Indians&hellip; not guardians&hellip; Indians, are tied at two games a piece after the Yankees won 4-2 on Sunday.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Toby Sumpter and today is Friday, October 14, 2022, and this is your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.sbts.edu/2022/10/13/fall-trustees-meeting-board-commends-mohlers-stance-on-meaning-of-pastor-in-bfm-2000/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://news.sbts.edu/2022/10/13/fall-trustees-meeting-board-commends-mohlers-stance-on-meaning-of-pastor-in-bfm-2000/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their annual fall board meeting Monday, trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary unanimously adopted a resolution commending the public stance seminary President Albert Mohler took on the office of a pastor during the 2022 SBC annual meeting in Anaheim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Messengers at the SBC&rsquo;s annual meeting in Anaheim, CA, considered precisely what the Baptist Faith &amp; Message 2000 means when it refers to the office of a pastor. Mohler argued that the SBC&rsquo;s confession of faith unequivocally reserves the office, function, and title of pastor to biblically qualified men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohler served on the committee that drafted the BF&amp;M 2000. On the convention floor in June, Mohler told messengers that there was no debate or confusion among BF&amp;M 2000 committee members as to what is meant by the term &ldquo;pastor:&rdquo; it is an office which Scripture defines clearly in terms of qualifications and limits to men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trustees&rsquo; resolution commends Mohler&rsquo;s stance. It concludes: &ldquo;It is further resolved that this Board encourages The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary administration and faculty to continue its theological training with this stated conviction&mdash;graduating both men and women for service to the church, but with men alone reserved for the office and function, and thereby title of pastor.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seminary leaders also reported on the institution&rsquo;s financial health. With financial instability in the United States, Southern Seminary&rsquo;s fiscal position, by God&rsquo;s grace, remains strong, Mohler said. Enrollment continues to be robust; during the 2021-22 school year, Southern experienced its second highest total of student hours sold. In addition, Boyce College has its highest-ever on-campus enrollment with 509 students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&rsquo;t slap &ldquo;family friendly&rdquo; on anything and thereby make it &ldquo;family friendly&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is called &ldquo;grooming&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is great, but parents need to realize that they let this happen. This happened on their watch when they handed the responsibility of educating children over to the state. You didn&rsquo;t protest when the state said they would be taxing your property to pay for schools that they would oversee. You didn&rsquo;t protest when the state implicitly threatened your authority and responsibility through state sponsored education. I appreciate this push back, but we need to take responsponsibility for our complicity in how we got here.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pastor Wilson likes to say that you have to throw down at the first crime scene. When the men in ski masks pull up in their dark van, you don&rsquo;t go with them, you don&rsquo;t go with them to some warehouse, sit down in a chair and calmly let them tie you up and gag you, and then finally when they hang you upside down and point a gun at you, do you start screaming. When we get to the part in the story where elected school boards are sponsoring Drag Queens grooming children for sexaulization, transgenderism, etc, that&rsquo;s a third or fourth crime scene. We didn&rsquo;t yell when they insisted on government sponsored education. We didn&rsquo;t scream when they told us that we don&rsquo;t know how to raise and educate our own children.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop making a big deal about color of skin. Focus on the game. Focus on life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stop it. This </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the marxist play: cultivating difference in order to cultivate envy, enmity, animosity in order for the state to come in and save us. But when the peace of Christ cuts through animosities and enmities, it makes men free. We don&rsquo;t need your government programs. We have Christ. We have His people. We have our families. </span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Life&rsquo;s short</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: And this teaches us to number our days. Confess your sins. Get right with God. Get right with your family. Don&rsquo;t nurse grudges. That makes you susceptible to socialism and marxism. Get clean. Get forgiven. Get free.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Liberty Dispatch</strong> ~ October 13, 2022</p>
<p class="p1">While a Pzifer executive openly admits to the inefficacy of the COVID vaccines to stop transmission, the College of Physicians and Surgeons Ontario (CPSO) advises that doctors ought to medicate those who don't want to take the vaccine rather than giving them an exemption. Tune in as co-hosts Andrew DeBartolo and Matthew Hallick, with guest host Michael Thiessen dig into the crumbling COVID narrative.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're not tuning in LIVE to watch the Starving Comics' Quarantine show every Sunday at 7:00pm Eastern, then you're not living up to your full potential. &nbsp;Here's a sample of what you're missing!</p>

Listen to John thomas Oaks--musician, composer, and Story-Teller Extraordinaire. And laugh at Juan DeVevo--dead pan King of One-Liners and founding member of Casting Crowns.</p>
<p>On this episode of SCQS: Half the usual team is OUT OF TOWN. But Tabby is taking over the Producer's seat.&nbsp; And Brian Apprille is a very capable host. We're playing a game of Misheard Lyrics.&nbsp; Plus, a surprise appearance from someone who wasn't supposed to make it.&nbsp;</p>

   <title><![CDATA["Dirty Harry" is a Christian Film? Are You Crazy? (Maybe.) [The Pugcast]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/56b7facb-18f5-4546-a4cf-c5b0e21de456/dirty-harry-is-a-christian-film-are-you-crazy-maybe.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Dirty Harry is one of Clint Eastwood's best known films. It is also violent, full of profanity, and sprinkled with gratuitous nudity. How could anyone possibly mistake it for a Christian film? Today Chris makes a case for just that--he's not saying you should watch it as a family--or even that you should watch it. He makes the argument instead that it is a film that only makes sense within a Christian worldview--within a Christian framework of meaning. It is filled with subtle allusions to Christ--but the Jesus hinted at in Dirty Harry is not meek or mild. He's angry--and for good reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Today's episode was inspired by an essay published in Law and Liberty by Titus Techera--you can find it here: <a href="https://lawliberty.org/dirty-harrys-justice/?fbclid=IwAR1HvepaLIgMN-21anGWYXfEIXoIdkpjVyxSalVfib-QKmianv2qlpXVdFU"><span class="s1">https://lawliberty.org/dirty-harrys-justice/</span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, here&rsquo;s what you may have missed over the weekend.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/colorado-officials-incorrectly-sent-out-30000-voter-registration-postcards-to-noncitizens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/colorado-officials-incorrectly-sent-out-30000-voter-registration-postcards-to-noncitizens</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado Officials &lsquo;Incorrectly&rsquo; Sent Out 30,000 Voter Registration Postcards To Noncitizens</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado officials claim they accidentally sent approximately 30,000 postcards last month to noncitizens instructing them how they could register to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First reported by Colorado Public Radio News, Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold&rsquo;s office said department employees had sent the postcards on Sept. 27 after comparing a list of 102,000 names provided by the Electronic Registration Information Center, a nonprofit organization aiming to improve U.S. voter rolls and advocating residents to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Department has become aware that approximately 30,000 EBU [Eligible But Unregistered] postcard mailers were incorrectly sent to ineligible Coloradans,&rdquo; a spokesperson for the Colorado Secretary of State&rsquo;s Office told local media. &ldquo;The office is undertaking an internal review of the incident and will take any corrective action that is warranted.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griswold insisted noncitizens would not be allowed to register to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The postcards, which the office printed in English and Spanish, read, &ldquo;A message from Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold . . . Our records indicate that you or your household may be eligible to vote, but do not appear to be registered at your current address.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mailers did include that to vote that residents must be 18 years old by Election Day, a United States citizen, and a Colorado resident for at least 22 days before the upcoming election, according to Colorado Public Radio News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griswold&rsquo;s office said they plan on sending out correction mailers to the noncitizens, &ldquo;reminding them that only those that meet the above requirements are eligible to register.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to local media, while the office had compared the list of potential unregistered voters to local DMV records, the data had included noncitizen drivers with Colorado driver&rsquo;s licenses which the state issues for noncitizens to drive legally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Council on State Legislatures website shows Colorado as one of at least 17 states, along with the District of Columbia, that issue driver&rsquo;s licenses to non-U.S. citizens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the system did not distinguish their eligibility to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the Voting Rights Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told The Journal that the system making a mistake indicates it works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griswold is up for reelection in the November midterms, where she will face Republican Pam Anderson, the head of the state&rsquo;s county clerks association.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC Won&rsquo;t Release Review of Post-Vaccination Heart Inflammation</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will not release its review of post-COVID-19-vaccination heart inflammation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC has been performing abstractions on reports of post-vaccination myocarditis, a form of heart inflammation, submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the agency is saying that federal law prevents it from releasing the results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abstractions &ldquo;are considered medical records which are withheld in full from disclosure,&rdquo; the CDC told The Epoch Times in a recent letter, responding to a Freedom of Information Act request.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the exemptions in the act says that agencies can withhold materials that are &ldquo;specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, if that statute (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and (B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC pointed to the Public Health Service Act, which was enacted in 1944, and says that vaccine injury reports and other information that may identify a person shall not be made available to any person except the person who received the vaccine or a legal representative for that person.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information sought is available through the CDC website without details that would identify patients, the agency also said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC said that it does not have a formal definition of &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; but that it means the process of reviewing medical records, including autopsy reports and death certificates, and recording data in a database. &ldquo;Please note that this definition means that any abstracted data, because they originate from medical records, is also considered medical records,&rdquo; a CDC records officer told The Epoch Times in an email.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refusing to release the data raises concerns about transparency, according to Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The stubborn refusal of officials heading up federal health agencies responsible for protecting the public health to come clean with Americans about what they know about COVID vaccine risks is stunning,&rdquo; Fisher told The Epoch Times in an email.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher noted that the CDC has funded electronic medical record systems that collect personal health information and that the agency shares the data with a number of third parties, such as contractors and researchers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher called for a congressional probe into what she described as &ldquo;the disturbing lack of transparency on the part of federal agency officials, who granted COVID vaccine manufacturers an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to widely distribute the vaccines in December 2020 and have recommended and aggressively promoted the vaccines for mandated use ever since.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a separate Freedom of Information Act request, the CDC initially said that it did not perform any abstractions or produce any reports on post-vaccination myocarditis. That request was for reports between April 2, 2021, and Oct. 2, 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency also falsely said that a link between myocarditis and the messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccines was not known during that time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A possible link between those vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna, became known in early 2021. Many experts now acknowledge the link is likely or definitely causal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC&rsquo;s director, said in a press conference in April 2021 that the agency had not detected a link between the vaccines and myocarditis. The basis for that statement remains unclear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC still hasn&rsquo;t released the results of the data mining, to The Epoch Times, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), or a nonprofit called Children&rsquo;s Health Defense. The agency also declined to provide results from a different monitoring system, V-safe, to a nonprofit called Informed Consent Action Network, which then sued the agency and just recently received the first tranche of data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA, meanwhile, has refused to release the results of a different type of analysis on the VAERS data, claiming it cannot separate the results from protected internal communications. The agency is also withholding autopsies conducted on people who died after getting COVID-19 vaccines, pointing to exceptions laid out in the Freedom of Information Act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with Johnson, several other lawmakers are pressing at least one of the agencies to release the data, asserting that not doing so is illegal.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nike Co-Founder Phil Knight Donates $1 Million to Republican Oregon Gov. Candidate Christine Drazan</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight&rsquo;s donation to Drazan&rsquo;s campaign comes after he donated $3.75 million to Independent candidate Betsy Johnson, signaling his strong dislike for Tina Kotek.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican strategist Rebecca Tweed told KGW Knight&rsquo;s donation said the two donations are not meant as an endorsement of either candidate but rather an attack against the Democrat candidate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The donation comes as Christine Drazan stands within striking distance of unseating Kotek in a deep blue state that has not elected a Republican governor since Vic Atiyeh in 1982.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Breitbart News reported last week, a recent Emerson College poll showed the Oregon House Republican leader actually leading Koteck by two points &ndash; 36 percent to 34 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Emerson College Polling survey shows former Oregon House Republican leader Drazan ahead of former state House Speaker Tina Kotek (D)&ndash;36 percent to 34 percent. Nineteen percent of those polled plan to vote for former Democrat state senator-turned independent Betsy Johnson. The poll was conducted between Sept. 30 &ndash; Oct. 1 with 796 very likely Oregon voters. The survey&rsquo;s Credibility Interval (CI), similar to a margin of error, is &plusmn;3.4 percentage points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGW political analyst Len Bergstein concurred with Rebecca Tweed that Phil Knight&rsquo;s donation should be seen as a knock against Kotek by potentially putting Drazan on the path to victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;As soon as he sees some polls that say &lsquo;wait a minute, there&rsquo;s a chance that Drazan could win,&rsquo; he&rsquo;s saying well maybe my money could make the difference to push her over the top,&rdquo; said Bergstein.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is not a normal election. We&rsquo;re having fun watching it because we have three original candidates for governor and a lot of interesting twists and turns in the race already,&rdquo; Bergstein added.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's railway deal to avert strike spiked by union</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a month after President Biden announced that a deal had been reached between railroad companies and their unions, the deal has fallen apart, raising concerns for a possible strike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the Teamsters, one of the nation&rsquo;s largest railroad unions, rejected the deal on Monday, expressing discontent with the number of paid sick days, according to the Washington Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said that members of the third-largest union rejected the proposed five-year contract in a 56 to 43 percent split. Both sides have agreed to continue with negotiations until at least November 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Railroads are currently expected to continue operating normally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal included a 24 percent increase in pay by 2024, as well as $1,000 annual bonuses for employees over five years. The plan ensured that healthcare co-pays would not increase in price, but included only one paid sick day compared to the 15 days union leaders pushed for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal followed two years of negotiations between the rail carriers and unions, which prompted the White House to appoint an emergency board in July to mediate between the two groups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Biden applauded the tentative deal reached, calling it "an important win for our economy and the American people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>At a recent conference in Texas, Gary gave biblical encouragement from 2 Timothy 3. This chapter is often used to prove that we're living in the last days, and a confirmation of the victory of evil over God's kingdom here on earth. This is the exact opposite of what Paul is teaching in this chapter and it's very instructive and important for us to understand the real meaning and context of this passage.</p>]]></description>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/ff2bf5e6-9270-4809-a2b6-3bc91b162c46/the-thomist-tolkien-an-interview-with-yannick-imbert.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today the Pugcast welcomes French Reformed theologian Yannick Imbert onto the show! Yannick is the author of a new book on J. R. R. Tolkien, "From Imagination to Faerie: Tolkien's Thomist Fantasy". The book is a scholarly treatment of Tolkien's theological outlook and how it shaped Tolkien's understanding of language, myth and imagination. The Pugsters focus in primarily on Tolkien's views on language and how those conflict with contemporary understandings which are largely based on a set of assumptions informed by materialism. Enjoy!</p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/10b6ae5c-4833-42b0-ac7e-f09cf5e6ac7e/daily-news-brief-for-tuesday-october-4th-2022.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, October 4th, 2022. I hope you and your family had a great weekend with you and yours&hellip; also, just a heads up. There will be no newsbriefs for Thursday and Friday this week!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we do that however:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FLF Conference Plug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word didn&rsquo;t stay in Heaven. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory of the Father, full of grace and truth. Grace and Truth became flesh. The Word became flesh. The story of God&rsquo;s grace became flesh. And it is that Word, that truth, that story that will fill the world. That is why this year&rsquo;s Fight Laugh Feast Conference in Knoxville Tennessee is on Lies, Propaganda, storytelling, and the serrated edge. The Word is a sword. The Word is our glory. So join us, October 6-8, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, speakers including Pastor Doug Wilson, George Gilder, Ben Merkle, Jared Longshore, and Pastor Toby Sumpter, Chocolate Knox will be doing a round table with the Wilsons and Merkles on why stories are so potent for building family cultures that wine, all culminating in a live show with Megan Basham and Jason Whitlock talking Lies and Journalism. And we just announced a one day Saturday-only pass for 99$. Find out more and register or become a vendor at fightlaughfeast.com.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/revealed-barbara-bush-childrens-hospital-in-maine-offers-gender-transition-services-for-9-year-olds?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/revealed-barbara-bush-childrens-hospital-in-maine-offers-gender-transition-services-for-9-year-olds?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbara Bush Children's Hospital in Maine offers gender transition services for 9-year-olds</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Barbara Bush Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Maine promotes services for "transgender children," offering life-altering drugs such as puberty blockers and hormone treatments, as well as how-to guides on genital "tucking" for boys and "chest binding" methods for girls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1576654667253022721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1576654667253022721</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video 0:00-2:28</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That video is from a 2016 piece by WMTW ABC News titled "Lucy's story: Transgender children in Maine, Program at Barbara Bush Children's Hospital helps guide transgender children" written by Tracy Sabol.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video a pediatric endocrinologist at the hospital, Dr. Jerrold Olshan, said, "This isn't a choice in most individuals, this is probably biologically programmed."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olshan said "About one in four will attempt suicide, about half will consider suicide during adolescence and so our big goal is how do we help this population do better in the long run," citing the frequently debunked transgender affirm or suicide myth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence has emerged this year that treatment at gender clinics for children are actually increasing suicidal ideation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doctor's belief that gender ideology is "probably programmed" enabled the hospital to not only push chest binding and genital tucking, but life-changing drugs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let&rsquo;s talk about the data:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), the world's largest clinic treating transgender-identified youth, shows that patients treated at or referred to the clinic are at an estimated 5.5 times greater risk of committing suicide than the general population of adolescents, according to a new paper published this month in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several takeaways from Michael Biggs' study: Trans-identified youth treated or referred to GIDs are more likely to die by suicide than youth in the general population. The suicide rate is low for both populations. We cannot conclude that the GIDs patients committed suicide because of their trans identity, versus another cause.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these numbers are estimates based on the best available data; the study results would have been more accurate if a comparison between GIDs suicides and suicides amongst youth getting mental health care could be made. Based on what Biggs found, the media narrative that trans youth are suicides waiting to happen is a lie that does not help&mdash;and is likely to harm&mdash;trans-identified youth and their families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2010 and 2020, four youth out of 15,000 patients died by "known or suspected" suicide. The annual suicide rate of trans-identified youth was 0.03 percent. This is at odds with a mainstream media narrative that claims 50 percent of trans-identified youth attempt suicide, says Michael Biggs, Oxford sociology professor and author of this new paper.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/liberal-strongholds-cling-vaccine-mandates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/liberal-strongholds-cling-vaccine-mandates</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberal strongholds cling to vaccine mandates</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many people, the pandemic no longer factors into daily life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in a handful of liberal cities, universities, and companies, some people are still subject to vaccine mandates that may require as many as four shots to keep their jobs or spots in school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the mandates are facing growing protests and legal challenges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly two dozen former firefighters in Seattle filed a lawsuit against the city this week for denying their requests for religious exemptions to the vaccine and firing them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City&rsquo;s largest police union successfully sued to invalidate the city&rsquo;s vaccine mandate for its members; a judge ruled this week that the union&rsquo;s contract with the police department did not include an ability for the department to enforce such a mandate. The judge ordered the reinstatement of all the union-backed members fired under the vaccination requirements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, New York City officials said they planned to fight the ruling. More than 1,700 city workers across all departments had been fired as of this month over their refusal to comply with the vaccine mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four fired employees of a retirement care facility in Alabama filed a lawsuit last week against their former employer, alleging religious discrimination. The former employees claim their sincere requests for religious exemptions from the company&rsquo;s vaccine mandate were denied improperly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political support for such mandates has dropped precipitously over the past year, and even some of the most ardent defenders of mandates have rolled back requirements they once championed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), for example, boasted in January that his vaccine requirement had nearly doubled the vaccination rate of the state workforce. He stressed at the time that &ldquo;no intervention is as important as vaccination&rdquo; in fighting COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inslee rescinded the vaccine mandate earlier this month, setting an Oct. 31 date for its expiration while citing the value of &ldquo;different tools that are now more appropriate for the era we&rsquo;ve entered.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs had for months required not just COVID-19 vaccines but booster shots as well for employees working from its offices. The investment bank quietly ended its vaccine mandate in late August, as well as its testing requirements and mask guidance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other major companies that pushed vaccine mandates aggressively last year, when the Biden administration was fighting an ultimately losing battle to require vaccination in virtually all workplaces, have since dropped their policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comcast recently dropped its vaccine mandate for employees as it struggles to lure workers back into the office, while JPMorgan Chase said earlier this year that it would start hiring unvaccinated workers again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some corporations continue to insist workers get their COVID-19 shots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google and Facebook, for example, require vaccines for in-person employees, according to Axios .</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the most controversial remaining vaccine mandates is one imposed by Washington, D.C., leaders on children attending public school. Students 12 years and older must be fully vaccinated by January to remain in Washington, D.C., public schools; the deadline was originally set for the beginning of the school year this fall, but vaccination rates among black students, in particular, were low enough that city leaders pushed back the effective date.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some colleges and universities are requiring vaccines and boosters for all students &mdash; even those who take online classes. Georgetown University requires even fully online students to be fully vaccinated if at any point their studies will bring them to campus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the University of California, Berkeley, even vaccinated students will be banned from signing up for classes until they accept a booster shot. Recipients typically aren&rsquo;t eligible for boosters until several months after their primary vaccination series, and in the case of students not yet eligible for their booster shot, UC Berkeley rules say students &ldquo;will not have an enrollment until 30 days after you have become eligible to get your booster.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other jurisdictions are rolling vaccine mandates back slowly to balance the growing opposition to COVID-19 rules with the demands of groups that want them implemented indefinitely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) last week ended the city&rsquo;s policy of demanding that private companies in the city require vaccination for their employees, but he left in place the city&rsquo;s vaccine mandate for its own workers, for example.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/foreign/poland-demands-germany-pay-reparations-for-world-war-ii"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/foreign/poland-demands-germany-pay-reparations-for-world-war-ii</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland demands Germany pay $1.26 trillion in reparations for World War II</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland's foreign minister has signed a diplomatic note requesting that Germany pay the equivalent of $1.26 trillion in reparations for damage incurred by Poland during the Nazi German invasion that set off World War II.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $1.26 trillion amount was calculated from an extensive government report on lasting damages from the war, released on the 83rd anniversary of Germany's Sept. 1 invasion of Poland last month. Poland's Communist government had previously waived all further claims to compensation for WWII in 1953 under pressure from the Soviet Union, but the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) rejects this as invalid, according to Al Jazeera. PiS has taken up the cause of World War II reparations since its ascension to power in 2015, using German aggression in World War II as a central part of its nationalism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;[The note] expresses the position of the Polish minister of foreign affairs that the parties should take immediate steps to permanently and effectively &hellip; settle the issue of the consequences of aggression and German occupation,&rdquo; Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said of the matter, adding that it will be one of the foremost points of discussion during German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's visit to Warsaw on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany rejects all Polish claims for reparations, saying the matter has already been settled. It further points to the vast tracks of land Poland took from prewar Germany, given by Joseph Stalin when he redrew the postwar map of eastern Europe, as fitting compensation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Polish government believes the severity of damages from World War II means that further, direct payments are needed in compensation. Six million Poles are estimated to have died during the war.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within Just 48 Hours, Florida Received More Than $20 Million in Hurricane Donations</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla) and First Lady Casey DeSantis are praising the help his state has received following the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Ian. In just 48 hours, the state of Florida raised more than $20 million to go toward its Florida Disaster Fund.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From more than 52 different corporations and individuals such as Tom Brady, David Rubin, and Rumble, First Lady DeSantis says the money shows how loyal people are to Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within just hours of activating the Florida Disaster Fund, over $10 million was raised from countless people and corporations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes to show the support DeSantis has created by keeping his state free from liberal madness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that the money is already hard at work to clean up and restore people&rsquo;s homes after the category 4 storm wrecked livelihoods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis is working hard to make sure his state receives the help they need as the death toll from Ian raised to at least 50 people as floodwaters rise to dangerous levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic&hellip; sports, but today&rsquo;s story is a bit of a somber one&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/01/129-dead-during-fan-stampede-after-indonesian-soccer-match/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2022/10/01/129-dead-during-fan-stampede-after-indonesian-soccer-match/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 125 dead during fan stampede after Indonesian soccer match</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 125 people are dead &mdash; most of them trampled in a stampede&ndash; after violent brawls erupted between opposing fans after a soccer match in Indonesia Sunday, marking one of the deadliest crowd calamities in sporting history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities initially said that 174 people had been killed in the chaos, but the death toll had been revised after officials learned that some victims had been counted twice, according to East Java Deputy Governor Emil Dardak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous fights broke out among rival fans at the Kanjuruhan Stadium in East Java province&rsquo;s Malang city just as Persebaya Surabaya defeated home team Arema Malang 3-2 in the Indonesian Premier League Match on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to break up the fights, riot police fired tear gas which sent hundreds of panicked fans fleeing for the stadium exits, East Java Police Chief Nico Afinta said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the chaos, dozens of people were trampled to death instantly, while others suffocated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afinta said over 300 others were rushed to local hospitals, but many died on the way and during treatment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disaster began when fans of Arema had pelted players and officials with bottles and other objects following their loss, witnesses said. Many then flooded the field to confront the team&rsquo;s management about the unwanted outcome &ndash; Armea&rsquo;s first home loss to Persebaya in 23 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video circulating on social media shows fans from each side of the soccer pitch sprint toward midfield, appearing ready to fight each other before riot police suddenly run between them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other video shows hundreds of fans frantically sprinting across the pitch for the exits, flinging themselves over barriers and desperately climbing fences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot police can be seen kicking and hitting people with batons as they try to get away &mdash; and firing tear gas canisters directly into the crowd at both ends of the field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Officers fired tear gas directly at spectators in the stands, forcing us to run toward the exit,&rdquo; said spectator Ahmad Fatoni. &ldquo;Many victims fell because of shortness of breath and difficulty seeing due to tear gas and were trampled.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another video shot from the seats shows a whole section of the stands engulfed in tear gas as fans cry out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disturbing footage shows a mass of injured people packed tightly into an overwhelmed hospital, with some lying motionless on the hospital floor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Indonesia&rsquo;s lack of international accolades in the sport, hooliganism is rife in the soccer-obsessed country where fanaticism often ends in violence, as in the 2018 death of a supporter who was killed by a mob of hardcore fans of rival club in 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that is what happens when you worship other idols other than God&hellip; He gives you over to madness.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: Don't Play Cards or Spank Your Kids (Eucharist) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/30e7d46d-7c0b-4973-85fb-ada9a3967b53/tcnd-dont-play-cards-or-spank-your-kids-eucharist.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>We can't promise this conversation will be better than LAST week's, but ...welcome to the table anyway!</p>
<p>Emmi is wearing a lot of hats, and The Peaches is going to her dance class soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Oops, sorry, we mean "rhymic movement.")</p>
<p>Let's talk about Legalism!&nbsp; First--we give a brief history of things that would get you reprimanded by Church People 40 years ago. (Cards, alcohol-consumption, and dancing!)&nbsp; The anti-dancing crowd will say it's important to "avoid the appearance of evil."&nbsp; And, to that, a ready reply should be: "True! So why don't you stop appearing to be such a Pharisee???"&nbsp; &nbsp; This is known as Good Rhetoric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, The Peaches makes an excellent transition to discussing the NEW Legalism: Internet Karens who say all disciplinary spanking is abusive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be a Pharisee.&nbsp; So--Christians need to use this fact to their rhetorical advantage.&nbsp; In other words, we need to get better at framing the anti-spank Pharisees as judgmental jerks.&nbsp; If you're looking for an example of an actual social media exchange with a Pearl-Clutching Karen who doesn't love her kids enough to spank them, we've got you covered!&nbsp; Visit Kendra Tierney's blog, Catholic All Year, if you want great advice from an experience mom who spanks her kids with great results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email us at nextdoor@johnbranyan.com -- and visit the website (johnbranyan.com) for information about going on vacation with us!&nbsp; &nbsp;Vacay with Comics, 2023.&nbsp; It's gonna be great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ian-impact-path-d4db93bcac5af1134e31a3b7f2f694f0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ian-impact-path-d4db93bcac5af1134e31a3b7f2f694f0</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PUNTA GORDA, Fla. (AP) &mdash; Rescue crews piloted boats and waded through inundated streets Thursday to save thousands of Floridians trapped amid flooded homes and shattered buildings left by </span><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Ian,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which crossed into the Atlantic Ocean and churned toward another landfall in South Carolina.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hours after weakening to a tropical storm while crossing the Florida peninsula, Ian regained hurricane strength Thursday evening after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center predicted it would make landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devastation inflicted on Florida began to come into focus a day after </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-ian-live-updates-cc53497a4e7a53523c4f63c7bd9ffa0a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian struck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a monstrous Category 4 hurricane and one of the strongest storms ever to hit the U.S. It flooded homes on both the state&rsquo;s coasts, cut off the only bridge to a barrier island, destroyed a historic waterfront pier and knocked out electricity to 2.67 million Florida homes and businesses &mdash; nearly a quarter of utility customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least one man was confirmed dead in Florida, while two other people were reported killed in Cuba after the hurricane struck the island Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aerial photos from the Fort Myers area, a few miles west of where Ian struck land, showed homes ripped from their slabs and deposited among shredded wreckage. Businesses near the beach were completely razed, leaving twisted debris. Broken docks floated at odd angles beside damaged boats and fires smoldered on lots where houses once stood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how anyone could have survived in there,&rdquo; William Goodson said amid the wreckage of the mobile home park in Fort Myers Beach where he&rsquo;d lived for 11 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hurricane tore through the park of about 60 homes, many of them, including Goodson&rsquo;s single-wide home destroyed or mangled beyond repair. Wading through waist-deep water, Goodson and his son wheeled two trash cans containing what little he could salvage of his belongings &mdash; a portable air conditioner, some tools and a baseball bat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road into Fort Myers was littered with broken trees, boat trailers and other debris. Cars were left abandoned in the roadway, having stalled when the storm surge flooded their engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never seen storm surge of this magnitude,&rdquo; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told a news conference. &ldquo;The amount of water that&rsquo;s been rising, and will likely continue to rise today even as the storm is passing, is basically a 500-year flooding event.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving Florida as a tropical storm Thursday and entering the Atlantic Ocean north of Cape Canaveral, Ian spun up into a hurricane again with winds of 75 mph (120 kph). The hurricane center predicted it would continue to strengthen before hitting South Carolina on Friday, but still remain a Category 1 storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hurricane warning was issued for the South Carolina coast and extended to Cape Fear on the southeastern coast of North Carolina. With tropical-storm force winds reaching 415 miles (667 kilometers) from its center, Ian was forecast to shove storm surge of 5 feet (1.5 meters) into coastal areas in Georgia and the Carolinas. Rainfall of up to 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) threatened flooding from South Carolina to Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheriffs in southwest Florida said 911 centers were inundated by thousands of stranded callers, some with life-threatening emergencies. The U.S. Coast Guard began rescue efforts hours before daybreak on barrier islands near where Ian struck, DeSantis said. More than 800 members of federal urban search-and-rescue teams were also in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Orlando area, Orange County firefighters used boats to reach people in a flooded neighborhood. A photo the department posted on Twitter showed one firefighter carrying someone in his arms through knee-deep water. At an area nursing home, patients were carried on stretchers across floodwaters to a waiting bus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those rescued was Joseph Agboona. &ldquo;We were happy to get out,&rdquo; he said after grabbing two bags of possessions when water rose to the windows in his Orlando home. &ldquo;It was very, very bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fort Myers, Valerie Bartley&rsquo;s family spent desperate hours holding a dining room table against their patio door, fearing the storm raging outside &ldquo;was tearing our house apart.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I was terrified,&rdquo; Bartley said. &ldquo;What we heard was the shingles and debris from everything in the neighborhood hitting our house.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm ripped away patio screens and snapped a palm tree in the yard, Bartley said, but left the roof intact and her family unharmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fort Myers, some people left shelters to return home Thursday afternoon. Long lines formed at gas stations and a Home Depot opened, letting in a few customers at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Pino was near the back of the line, with about 100 people in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I hope they leave something,&rdquo; Pino said, &ldquo;because I need almost everything.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities confirmed at least one Florida death &mdash; a 72-year-old man in Deltona who fell into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in the heavy rain, the Volusia County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said. Two other storm deaths were reported in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said his office was scrambling to respond to thousands of 911 calls in the Fort Myers area, but many roads and bridges were impassable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency crews sawed through toppled trees to reach stranded people. Many in the hardest-hit areas were unable to call for help because of electrical and cellular outages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chunk of the Sanibel Causeway fell into the sea, cutting off access to the barrier island where 6,300 people live. It was unknown how many heeded orders to evacuate, but Charlotte County Emergency Management Director Patrick Fuller expressed cautious optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No deaths or injuries have been confirmed in the county, and flyovers of barrier islands show &ldquo;the integrity of the homes is far better than we anticipated,&rdquo; Fuller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South of Sanibel Island, the historic beachfront pier in Naples was destroyed, with even the pilings underneath torn out. &ldquo;Right now, there is no pier,&rdquo; said Penny Taylor, a Collier County commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Port Charlotte, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-hurricanes-health-hurricane-ian-storms-feafd6741badece7e416d9f1bfb2db73"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a hospital&rsquo;s emergency room flooded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fierce winds ripped away part of the roof, sending water gushing into the intensive care unit. The sickest patients &mdash; some on ventilators &mdash; were crowded into the middle two floors as the staff prepared for storm victims to arrive, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian struck Florida with 150 mph (241 kph) winds that tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane ever to hit the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While scientists generally avoid blaming climate change for specific storms without detailed analysis, Ian&rsquo;s watery destruction fits what scientists have predicted for a warmer world: stronger and wetter hurricanes, though not necessarily more of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This business about very, very heavy rain is something we&rsquo;ve expected to see because of climate change,&rdquo; said MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see more storms like Ian.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first transgender officer in the U.S. Army and wife have both been indicted for allegedly attempting to communicate with Russian officials in the hopes of giving them kompromat on some members of the military and their spouses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer, Major Jamie Lee Henry, 39, and wife Dr. Anna Gabrielian, 36, had reportedly made contact with someone whom they thought worked at the Russian embassy but who was actually an undercover FBI agent. </span><a href="https://health.usnews.com/doctors/jamie-henry-978328"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an internist, is a medical doctor with security clearance at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, one of the largest military installations in the entire world. Gabrielian, an anesthesiology and critical care instructor at Johns Hopkins, allegedly expressed hope to the FBI agent that they could use her husband's security clearance to obtain the private medical records of some strategic members of the military and/or their spouses and relatives that Russian officials could then "exploit."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the indictment, which was unsealed on Thursday, Gabrielian said she was motivated to help Russia because of her Russian patriotism, and her </span><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/anna-gabrielian"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Johns Hopkins does indicate that Gabrielian speaks fluent Russian. However, it is unclear whether she is a Russian national or somehow otherwise affiliated with the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Henry was not said to be motivated by Russian patriotism, the indictment does suggest the Army officer expressed some sympathy for Russian interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My point of view is until the United States actually declares war against Russia," Henry allegedly told the agent, "I'm able to help as much as I want."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry also told the agent that Henry had attempted to enlist in the Russian army to fight against Ukraine but had been rejected for a lack of combat experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The way I am viewing what is going on in Ukraine now, is that the United States is using Ukrainians as a proxy for their own hatred toward Russia," Henry allegedly said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabrielian also allegedly called Henry a "coward" when the Army officer expressed misgivings about violating HIPPA regulations in service to Russia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a meeting with the agent at a hotel last month, Gabrielian reportedly gave the agent private medical information belonging to the spouse of a service member in the Office of Naval Intelligence, as well as the information of a relative from an Air Force veteran. Henry likewise handed the agent the medical records of five Fort Bragg patients, according to the filing. It is unclear whether Henry had treated those patients personally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that meeting, the couple also supposedly attempted to establish a contingency plan, in the event they were ever arrested.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabrielian allegedly requested that the Russian embassy help find her children "a nice flight to Turkey to go on vacation" so that they couldn't be used as "hostages" against her if she were ever incarcerated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Henry and Gabrielian have been charged with conspiracy and wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information. They face up to 15 years in prison each, if convicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple were married in 2015, the same year Henry came out as transgender. At the time, Henry gave an interview with </span><a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/byt-interviews-jamie-lee-henry-ahead-of-the-mautner-project-party"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brightest Young Things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "My passion is service member health," Henry said in the interview. "...The biggest part in supporting the health of service members is listening to them. Trauma has to be handled on an individual&rsquo;s timeline and in a way that is unique to that individual."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brightest Young Things has since changed its name to </span><a href="https://exactlyagency.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It claims to be an "award-winning Design, Strategy, and Events agency for brands who want to stay relevant with today's beautifully diverse audience."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almighty God says in His Word, &ldquo;Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people&rdquo; (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Prov%2014.34"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proverbs 14:34</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Scripture also teaches that it is the chief duty of any civic leader to reward those who do well and to punish evildoers (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom%2013.1%E2%80%937"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romans 13:1&ndash;7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). You have not only failed in that responsibility; you routinely turn it on its head, rewarding evildoers and punishing the righteous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Word of God pronounces judgment on those who call evil good and good evil (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Isa%205.20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isaiah 5:20</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and yet many of your policies reflect this unholy, upside-down view of honor and morality. The diabolical effects of your worldview are evident in the statistics of California&rsquo;s epidemics of crime, homelessness, sexual perversions (like homosexuality and transgenderism), and other malignant expressions of human misery that stem directly from corrupt public policy. I don&rsquo;t need to itemize or elaborate on the many immoral decisions you have perpetrated against God and the people of our state, which have only exacerbated these problems. Nevertheless, my goal in writing is not to contend with your politics, but rather to plead with you to hear and heed what the Word of God says to men in your position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Let all kings bow down before Him, all nations serve Him&rdquo; (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps%2072.11"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psalm 72:11</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;He who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God, is as the light of the morning when the sun rises&rdquo; (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/2%20Sam%2023.3%E2%80%934"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 Samuel 23:3&ndash;4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is an abomination for kings to commit wicked acts, for a throne is established on righteousness&rdquo; (</span><a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Prov%2016.12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proverbs 16:12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
