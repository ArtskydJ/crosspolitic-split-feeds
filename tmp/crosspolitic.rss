   <description><![CDATA[<p>When God put Adam in the Garden he gave him a pattern to follow in order to shape the world as he and his bride took dominion. In the Lords Prayer Jesus taught us to pray that Gods Kingdom would come on earth as it is in heaven. Heavenly, spiritual realities give meaning and purpose to this symbolic world.</p>
<p>This week P Nate is joined by Dominic Bnonn Tennant to talk about his newest project - True Magic.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supreme Court bans affirmative action in ruling against race-conscious college admissions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court ruled to ban the consideration of race as part of admissions decisions at colleges, including Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, ending the decadeslong practice known as affirmative action.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the six-member majority to undo the lasting impacts of the landmark 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which upheld race-conscious admissions at universities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Harvard&rsquo;s and UNC&rsquo;s admissions programs violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," the majority held in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented and was joined by Justice Elena Kagan. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented in the UNC case, joined by Sotomayor and Kagan. Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case due to her past service on the university board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justices have been mulling since November over two cases brought by the nonprofit group Students for Fair Admissions, headed by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum, a staunch critic of affirmative action policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority held that "nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise. But, despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justice Clarence Thomas added that he would "highly doubt" universities could carry on with considering race in admissions policies with the new test that was established Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In the future, universities wishing to discriminate based on race in admissions must articulate and justify a compelling and measurable state interest based on concrete evidence. Given the strictures set out by the Court, I highly doubt any will be able to do so."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During oral arguments in October 2022, the court's inclination to ban affirmative action was evident. The court's six conservatives expressed skepticism toward the practice, even as attorneys for Harvard and UNC, along with U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, implored the court to permit the practice to continue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another case filed in 2014 alleged the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill unlawfully discriminates against white and Asian American applicants. That suit accused the university of violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment promise of equal protection under the law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banning the use of affirmative action will force elite colleges to reinvent their policies and find new ways to ensure diversity in their student populations without using race as a consideration. Several universities have expressed concerns in legal briefs that a decision to overturn affirmative action could result in fewer minority students on campuses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But ahead of the high court's opinion release, legal experts speculated colleges might attempt to maintain a superficial vision for diversity on campus without taking race into consideration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The matter of race-neutral admissions policies that are implemented for racially conscious ends could find its way to the Supreme Court soon. A group of parents, alumni, and community members at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax, Virginia, sued the school for changing its admissions process to increase the number of black and brown students and decrease the number of Asian students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the school's new process did not violate federal law. The case's next stop would be the Supreme Court.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1185087587/google-says-it-will-start-blocking-canadian-news-stories-in-response-to-new-law"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1185087587/google-says-it-will-start-blocking-canadian-news-stories-in-response-to-new-law</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google says it will start blocking Canadian news stories in response to new law</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google said on Thursday that it will block all links to Canadian news articles for people using its search engine and other services in the country in response to a new law that would compel tech companies to pay publishers for content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes a week after Meta vowed its own blackout of Canadian publishers on Facebook and Instagram, calling the law "fundamentally flawed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two tech giants have been battling the Canadian government over the law that would force them to negotiate compensation deals with news organizations for distributing links to news stories.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law, called the Online News Act, passed last week. But it could take months for it to take effect. Once it does, Google and Meta say they will start removing news articles by Canadian publishers from their services in the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters of the legislation have argued that it could provide a much-needed lifeline to the ailing news industry, which has been gutted by Silicon Valley's ironclad control of digital advertising.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the law, platforms like Meta and Google would have to come to the negotiating table with news organizations and hammer out compensation deals. Government estimates predict that the law would result in a cash injection of some $329 million into the Canadian news industry, which has been beset by news staff layoffs and other downsizing in recent years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada's law was modeled on a similar effort in Australia, where Meta did block news articles for nearly a week before tense negotiations led Meta and Google to eventually strike deals with news publishers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill to force tech companies to pay publishers is also advancing in California, where the tech industry has levied similar blackout threats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Canada, both tech platforms have long been against the law, saying the companies are already helping news companies by directing web traffic to their sites. On Facebook and Instagram, news represents a tiny fraction &mdash; on Facebook, it's about 3% &mdash; of what people see every day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, too, does not consider news articles as essential to its service. So both companies have wagered that it is simply easier to block links to news articles than to start paying news organizations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most major publishers in Canada back the new law, outside media observers have not been so sure. Tech writer Casey Newton has argued that a tax on displaying links would "effectively break the internet" if it was applied to the rest of the web. Other critics have pointed to the lack of transparency over who actually would receive cash infusion from the tech companies. Some fear the programs could be hijacked by disinformation sites that learn how to game the system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet press advocates insisted that tech companies retaliating by threatening to systemically remove news articles will be a blow to civil society and the public's understanding of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At a moment when disinformation swirls in our public discourse, ensuring public access to credible journalism is essential, so it's deeply disappointing to see this decision from Google and Meta," said Liz Woolery, who leads digital policy at PEN America, an organization that supports freedom of expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woolery continued: "As policymakers explore potential solutions to the challenges facing the journalism industry, platforms are free to critique, debate, and offer alternatives, but reducing the public's access to news is never the right answer."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan tracks pair of Russian warships off island&rsquo;s eastern coast</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan scrambled aircraft and dispatched ships late Tuesday to monitor the passage of two Russian warships off its eastern coast, according to the island&rsquo;s Ministry of National Defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Russian frigates traveled northward along the coast toward the East China Sea around 11 p.m. Tuesday, the ministry said in a news release Tuesday. It did not specify how far offshore the ships were.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Taiwan&rsquo;s military used &ldquo;joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance methods&rdquo; and &ldquo;dispatched mission aircraft, ships and shore-mounted missile systems to closely monitor&rdquo; the Russian vessels, according to the release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ships continued on course and left Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;response area&rdquo; southeast of Suao, a city on the island&rsquo;s northeastern edge that is also home to a logistics support naval base, according to the Defense Ministry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Taiwan reports near-daily activity from the Chinese military off its western coast in the Taiwan Strait &mdash; 49 Chinese aircraft and 20 ships have been reported in the waterway since Sunday &mdash; Russian activity is less common.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warships&rsquo; passage comes less than a week after the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary outfit, organized a brief, two-day rebellion against the Russian government that began Friday with the group taking over military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don and concluded Saturday after they stood down and withdrew from the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also comes just over a week after Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing to meet with high-level Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, which Blinken described as &ldquo;candid and constructive&rdquo; but failed to secure the United States&rsquo; top priority of renewed communication between the two countries&rsquo; militaries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beijing considers Taiwan, a functionally independent democracy, to be a breakaway province and aims to reunite it with the mainland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China and Russia remain close allies, with the two countries regularly coordinating military exercises together, although Beijing has not openly endorsed Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Severe weather, FAA shortfalls kick off rocky start to summer air travel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flight disruptions mounted Tuesday as severe storms and staffing issues kicked off a rocky start to summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 7,700 flights were delayed Tuesday and nearly 2,200 were canceled, FlightAware data showed, as thunderstorms that derailed thousands of trips over the weekend lingered in airspace that is heavily congested on a clear-weather day. That&rsquo;s on top of more than 8,800 U.S. delays and close to 2,250 cancellations Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Aviation Administration paused flights bound for New York&rsquo;s LaGuardia Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. Delays were averaging three hours or longer at those airports. The FAA said that the thunderstorms were blocking arrival and departure routes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disruptions come ahead of the busy Fourth of July holiday travel period, when millions are expected to fly. The Transportation Security Administration said it could screen more travelers than in 2019, before the pandemic, raising competition for spare seats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has pressured airlines to improve their operations after widespread flight disruptions last spring and summer, which prompted carriers to trim their overambitious schedules. But the industry struggled to recover this past weekend from a series of thunderstorms that didn&rsquo;t let up for days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thunderstorms are difficult for airlines because they can form with less warning than other major weather obstacles like winter storms or hurricanes. Rolling delays could force crews to reach federally mandated workday limits and further worsen disruptions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 30,000 flights have arrived late since Saturday, FlightAware data showed, with cancellation rates from Saturday through Monday up more than three times the average for the year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some airline executives have also blamed some of the disruptions on shortages of air traffic controllers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told staff on Monday that &ldquo;the FAA frankly failed us this weekend.&rdquo; He said that during Saturday&rsquo;s storms the FAA reduced arrival rates by 40% and departures by 75% at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, one of the airline&rsquo;s biggest hubs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staffing challenges aren&rsquo;t new. The Covid-19 pandemic derailed hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, and the agency is now trying to catch up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General said in a report last week that air traffic control staffing shortfalls put air traffic operations at risk. In March, the FAA and some airlines agreed to reduce flights to help ease congestion at busy New York airports because of the staffing issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the problems persist at a time when airlines are readying crews and schedules for a busy summer season, fueled by sustained travel demand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the disruptions frustrated flight crews who were left waiting on hold for reassignments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents flight attendants at United and others said in a memo to members Monday that hold times for crew scheduling were longer than three hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the union&rsquo;s memo, United said it has &ldquo;deployed all available resources to catch up on call volume, including increasing staffing in crew scheduling and mandatory overtime on the scheduling team.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/over-200-billion-in-covid-relief-funds-lost-to-potential-fraud-and-abuse-gov-t-watchdog-finds-significantly-higher-than-previous-estimates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/over-200-billion-in-covid-relief-funds-lost-to-potential-fraud-and-abuse-gov-t-watchdog-finds-significantly-higher-than-previous-estimates</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Over $200 billion in COVID relief funds lost to potential fraud and abuse, gov't watchdog finds &mdash; significantly higher than previous estimates</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report released Tuesday from the Office of Inspector General of the Small Business Administration found that the federal government lost more than $200 billion in COVID relief funds to potential fraud, waste, and abuse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OIG's latest estimate is significantly higher than previous projections that speculated approximately $100 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relief initiatives included the Paycheck Protection and COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs, created to provide emergency financial relief to small businesses and those who lost their jobs due to restrictive lockdown measures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report estimated that at least 17% of the relief funds, which totaled approximately $1.2 trillion, were disbursed to potential fraudsters, including "more than $136 billion COVID-19 EIDLs and $64 billion in PPP funds."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspector General Hannibal "Mike" Ware noted that the OIG's investigation into the potentially stolen funds has, so far, resulted in 1,011 indictments, 803 arrests, and 529 convictions. Approximately $30 billion in fraudulently obtained relief funds have been seized and returned to the SBA.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ware previously predicted during a 2021 interview with ABC News, "In terms of the monetary value, the amount of fraud in these COVID relief programs is going to be larger than any government program that came before it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report claimed that the extensive fraud resulted from the SBA's "weakened or removed" controls to allow swift distribution of emergency funds to those in need.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OIG reported that the eased review process had the "allure of 'easy money'" for fraudsters who saw an opportunity to exploit the SBA's lowered barriers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OIG's report stated: "OIG is working on tens of thousands of investigative leads on alleged fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer resources. Thousands of investigations will ensue for years to come because of swift congressional action to increase the statute of limitations to 10 years for COVID-19 EIDL and PPP fraud. We continue to identify fraud schemes, and we anticipate the overall potential fraud estimate could fluctuate; therefore, we may issue periodic updates to this report.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey DeVries, acting associate administrator of the SBA, expressed concern that Ware's report contained "serious flaws that significantly overestimate fraud."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeVries stated that approximately 86% of the fraud occurred within the first nine months of the relief programs' rollouts, arguing that the agency's controls to prevent fraud improved over time.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutors reveal they have more footage of Jordan Neely&rsquo;s NYC subway chokehold death &mdash; as ex-Marine Daniel Penny enters not guilty plea</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors revealed Wednesday they have additional cellphone video from witnesses in Jordan Neely&rsquo;s subway chokehold death, as Marine Daniel Penny pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in the lightning-rod case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-year-old former infantry squad leader &mdash; who appeared in Manhattan Supreme Court clean-shaven and wearing a blue suit and maroon tie &mdash; was arraigned on charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide during the brief, minutes-long hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stoic Penny spoke only to say &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; as more than 50 people &mdash; including his supporters, backers of Neely, 30,&nbsp; and many members of the media &mdash; looked on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Island native was caught on bystander video putting Neely &mdash; who witnesses said had been threatening subway riders &mdash; into a chokehold on an F train on May 1. The medical examiner&rsquo;s office later ruled Neely&rsquo;s death a homicide.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court documents filed Wednesday show that prosecutors have at least five cellphone videos from three witnesses to the deadly encounter that they plan to introduce as evidence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also have videotaped statements from two other witnesses, as well as two MTA surveillance videos and police body-worn camera footage, the document states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, prosecutors disclosed they have a videotaped statement that Penny made to cops the day of the incident &mdash; when they released him without charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny&rsquo;s statements to cops inside the Broadway-Lafayette Street station, as detailed in the filing, echo what he has said publicly about the incident since.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny described what could be seen in the shocking video of the confrontation, that Neely was &ldquo;rolling, he was rolling, when he was in a choke. He was going crazy,&rdquo; the filing states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny also told police that Neely was &ldquo;acting irate, dropping things on the floor, saying he doesn&rsquo;t care if he goes to jail,&rdquo; according to the court doc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny surrendered to authorities on May 12 after the Manhattan District Attorney&rsquo;s Office brought charges against him. He was indicted by a grand jury earlier this month and remains free on $100,000 bail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He faces up to 19 years behind bars if convicted on both counts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penny has said he didn&rsquo;t mean to kill Neely, but that he felt he had to step in for the safety of other passengers as Neely &mdash; who had a long history of mental illness &mdash; had been throwing trash at riders and threatening them as they moved away from him.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>National Geographic lays off its last remaining staff writers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like one of the endangered species whose impending extinction it has chronicled, National Geographic magazine has been on a relentlessly downward path, struggling for vibrancy in an increasingly unforgiving ecosystem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Washington-based magazine that has surveyed science and the natural world for 135 years reached another difficult passage when it laid off all of its last remaining staff writers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cutback &mdash; the latest in a series under owner Walt Disney Co. &mdash; involves some 19 editorial staffers in all, who were notified in April that these terminations were coming. Article assignments will henceforth be contracted out to freelancers or pieced together by editors. The cuts also eliminated the magazine&rsquo;s small audio department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Departing staffers said Wednesday the magazine has curtailed photo contracts that enabled photographers to spend months in the field producing the publication&rsquo;s iconic images.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a further cost-cutting move, copies of the famous bright-yellow-bordered print publication will no longer be sold on newsstands in the United States starting next year, the company said in an internal announcement last month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Geographic writer Craig Welch noted the moment in a tweet on Wednesday: &ldquo;My new National Geographic just arrived, which includes my latest feature &mdash; my 16th, and my last as a senior writer. &hellip; I&rsquo;ve been so lucky. I got to work w/incredible journalists and tell important, global stories. It&rsquo;s been an honor.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine&rsquo;s current trajectory has been years in the making, set in motion primarily by the epochal decline of print and ascent of digital news and information. In the light-speed world of digital media, National Geographic has remained an almost artisanal product &mdash; a monthly magazine whose photos, graphics and articles were sometimes the result of months of research and reporting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its peak in the late 1980s, National Geographic reached 12 million subscribers in the United States, and millions more overseas. Many of its devotees so savored its illumination of other worlds &mdash; space, the depths of the ocean, little-seen parts of the planet &mdash; that they stacked old issues into piles that cluttered attics and basements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains among the most widely read magazines in America, at a time when magazines are no longer widely read. At the end of 2022, it had just under 1.8 million subscribers, according to the authoritative Alliance for Audited Media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Geographic was launched by Washington&rsquo;s National Geographic Society, a foundation formed by 33 academics, scientists and would-be adventurers, including Alexander Graham Bell. The magazine was initially sold to the public as a perk for joining the society. It grew into a stand-alone publication slowly but steadily, reaching 1 million subscribers by the 1930s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine was eventually surpassed for profits and attention by the society&rsquo;s video operations, including its flagship National Geographic cable channel and Nat Geo Wild, a channel focused on animals. While they produced documentaries equal in quality to the magazine&rsquo;s rigorous reporting, the channels &mdash; managed by Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s 21st Century Fox &mdash; also aired pseudoscientific entertainment programming about UFOs and reality series like &ldquo;Sharks vs. Tunas&rdquo; at odds with the society&rsquo;s original high-minded vision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine&rsquo;s place of honor continued to dim through a series of corporate reshufflings that began in 2015 when the Society agreed to form a for-profit partnership with 21st Century Fox, which took majority control in exchange for $725 million. The partnership came under the Disney banner in 2019 as part of a massive $71 billion deal between Fox and Disney.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those who lost their jobs in the latest layoff was Debra Adams Simmons, who only last September was promoted to vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion at National Geographic Media, the entity that oversees the magazine and website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, David Miller, executive vice president of National Geographic Media, said the magazine was &ldquo;realigning key departments to help deepen engagement with our readers while also nurturing existing business models and developing new lines of revenue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email to The Post on Wednesday, National Geographic spokesperson Chris Albert said staffing changes will not affect the company&rsquo;s plans to continue publishing a monthly magazine &ldquo;but rather give us more flexibility to tell different stories and meet our audiences where they are across our many platforms.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>NYC Is Housing More Illegal Migrants Than Homeless People</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The number of migrants in New York City&rsquo;s care has outpaced the homeless population in local shelters, according to NBC4 New York.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As of Sunday, the city had 50,000 migrants in its care, including in local hotels and temporary shelters, and 49,700 local homeless residents, NBC4 reported. The influx of migrants crossing the southern border illegally has led to more migrants arriving in the Big Apple, some of whom have been bused in by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The city has turned the historic Roosevelt Hotel, which closed three years ago, into a migrant shelter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;My heart breaks a little bit, and I have these conflicting feelings,&rdquo; Deputy Mayor Anne Williams-Isom said during a tour of the hotel, according to NBC4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams has floated asking his residents to help shelter migrants in their homes, he said in early June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It is my vision to take the next step to this, to go to the faith-based locales and then move to private residents, there are residents who are suffering right now because of economic challenges,&rdquo; Adams said at the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;They have spare rooms, they have locales and if we can find a way to get over the 30-day rule and other rules that government has in its place, we can take that $4.2 billion, $4.3 maybe now, that we potentially will have to spend, and we can put it back in the pockets of everyday New Yorkers, everyday houses of worship, instead of putting it in the pockets of corporations,&rdquo; Adams added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Adams has also taken matters into his own hands by busing some of the arriving migrants to New York suburbs, including an area near the northern border, where the Daily Caller News Foundation previously observed some of them crossing into Canada illegally. Adams has also transported dozens of migrants to Republican-run states, like Florida and Texas, South America and one to China, Politico reported Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Adams&rsquo; office didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/26/fox-news-fires-remaining-tucker-staffers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/26/fox-news-fires-remaining-tucker-staffers/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fox News Fires Remaining Tucker Staffers In Show&rsquo;s Final Stroke</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox News has fired the remaining staffers from Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s show as the network announces a new primetime lineup, Daily Caller confirmed Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The network let go of at least nine remaining staffers, including long-standing producers, in a move described as &ldquo;shockingly callous&rdquo; by one former Fox News producer who spoke to the Daily Caller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Some of the producers fired have been at Fox for well over a decade,&rdquo; the producer told the Daily Caller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Another former Fox producer told the Daily Caller that staffers on Carlson&rsquo;s team were repeatedly told following his departure that their jobs were safe, including as recently as last week when two of Carlson&rsquo;s producers left the network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The remaining staffers were told they could apply for any jobs throughout the company, the former producer told the Daily Caller, noting that employees who once staffed Bill O&rsquo;Reilly and Dan Bongino&rsquo;s show were simply reassigned on other shows after both hosts left the network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Staffers told the former producer the terminations were clearly an &ldquo;anti-Tucker move to purge any of his remaining stamp he had on the network as Fox begins this new lineup change.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The news comes after Fox News announced that Jesse Watters will replace Carlson in the 8:00 p.m. time slot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Watters, who originally started his career at the 8:00 p.m. time slot hosting a Man on the Street segment during Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s program, is slated to take over the hour, Fox News said in a press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Laura Ingraham will take over Watters&rsquo; 7:00 p.m. time slot while Greg Gutfeld will move his show to the 10:00 p.m. time slot. Sean Hannity will remain in his 9:00 p.m. slot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox announced in late April it was parting ways with Carlson just days after the network announced it was also parting ways with Dan Bongino. Carlson has since started hosting his own show on Twitter, prompting a public legal battle between Fox News and the Daily Caller co-founder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox News issued a &ldquo;cease and desist&rdquo; to Carlson in mid-June after accusing him of breaching his contract by violating its non-compete clause when he posted the first episode of his show on Twitter.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Actor Julian Sands found dead in California after going missing on hike</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The San Bernardino County Sheriff's office has confirmed the death of Julian Sands after human remains were found on Southern California's Mount Baldy. He was 65 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He was hiking Mount Baldy when his family reported him missing on January 13, 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sands had a wide and varied career but was best known for his role in the 1985 movie A Room with a View, starring opposite Helena Bonham Carter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sands learned acting at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. In A Room with a View, he played George Emerson, a love interest to the young upper-class Lucy Honeychurch, played by Carter. In 1986, he told NPR in an interview that he was well aware of the class dynamics at play in the movie. "Nobody's actually seen to do anything other than live some leisurely life which allows them to pursue their own indulgences," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Sands' acting career brought him an eclectic array of roles. His film credits include Arachnophobia, Leaving Las Vegas, and the Jackie Chan movie The Medallion. On TV, he appeared in small roles on shows such as Castle, Smallville and Dexter. In Season 5 of the action drama 24, he played the main villain Vladimir Bierko, a terrorist in possession of a deadly nerve gas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He loved the outdoors. In a 2020 interview with The Guardian, he was asked when he was happiest. His answer was: "Close to a mountain summit on a glorious cold morning."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now in entertainment news&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/26/the-flash-collapses-in-its-second-weekend-at-the-box-office-with-massive-72-drop-analyst-predicts-film-will-lose-at-least-150-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/26/the-flash-collapses-in-its-second-weekend-at-the-box-office-with-massive-72-drop-analyst-predicts-film-will-lose-at-least-150-million/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>&lsquo;The Flash&rsquo; Collapses In Its Second Weekend At The Box Office With Massive 72% Drop, Analyst Predicts Film Will Lose At Least $150 Million</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ezra Miller&rsquo;s The Flash completely collapsed at the box office with an enormous 72% drop from its opening weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Flash had a long row to hoe after it&rsquo;s extremely poor opening weekend of $55 million at the domestic box office. And it does not look like it&rsquo;s going to be reaping anything but losses following its second weekend collapse of 72%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The-Numbers reports the film only grossed $15.2 million in its second weekend despite adding another 22 more theaters compared to its first weekend. The per theater gross declined from $13,000 in its opening weekend to $3,587 in its second weekend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The film&rsquo;s second weekend much like its first underperformed predictions. Box office tracking website Box Office Pro predicted the film would have a 69% drop and bring in $17.3 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The-Numbers predicted the film would only have a 59% decline and would bring in $22.5 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Comparing the film to other DCEU films, The Flash is one of the worst performing films as it stands right now. The only films it&rsquo;s outperformed at the worldwide box office are Birds of Prey, The Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman 1984, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Following this second weekend, box office analyst OMB Reviews predicts The Flash will only bring in a total gross between $300 million to $400 million worldwide in its entire theatrical run.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, he goes on to note, &ldquo;roughly between $300 and $350 million dollars if the film performs as a typical bad movie.&rdquo; That means it will likely stay in the same position it is on the DCEU list given Shazam! grossed $363.5 million and Black Adam brought in $391.2 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">OMB Reviews then points to the reported cost of the film being between $200 million and $220 million. He notes this means the film will likely lose around $150 million due to his estimated predictions that the film&rsquo;s total cost with marketing is approximately $330 million. Factoring in the film&rsquo;s split with theaters, he predicts the film&rsquo;s break even point is $550 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Thus if the film performs at the top of his estimates at $400 million, it would lose $150 million.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, June 27th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>On anniversary of Roe v. Wade being overturned, GOP Rep. promotes bill to help expectant mothers</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On the anniversary of Roe v. Wade being overturned, Minnesota Republican Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach promoted a proposed bill titled "The HOPE Act" that promotes helping expectant mothers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"It is crucial that women are supported when facing an unexpected pregnancy, which is why I have introduced The Health, Opportunity, Protecting Life, Education (HOPE) Act, which improves access to prenatal telehealth care, supports positive alternatives to abortion, and improves access to information for expectant mothers, providing tangible ways to help women feel confident during and beyond their pregnancy," Fischbach wrote in an opinion piece published by The Hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion and allowing individual states to decide for themselves on whether to restrict or allow abortions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The HOPE Act would provide funding for grants and other activities related to maternal care. It would also establish informed consent and parental notification requirements for abortion providers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The HOPE Act creates a pilot grant program to provide support and equipment like blood pressure monitors, scales, and portable fetal heart rate monitors to community health providers," Fischbach wrote. "Increasing telehealth options gives expectant mothers the flexibility they need to receive the care they deserve."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It would also prohibit any government funding going to Planned Parenthood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bud-light-sponsors-toronto-pride-parade-naked-men-children"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/bud-light-sponsors-toronto-pride-parade-naked-men-children</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Bud Light sponsors Toronto Pride parade attended by naked men, children</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bud Light is serving as an official sponsor of the Toronto Pride parade, where video footage shows naked men standing around and riding bicycles in clear view of children attending the event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The footage, captured by Beth Baisch of the Post Millennial, shows dozens of attendees riding past a large cheering crowd. The fully naked bikers, some covered in paint or tattoos, wave back at the crowd. One naked man high-fives an onlooker while another peddles a recumbent bike with a gold blow-up swan adorned around his neck.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A second video shows a group of naked men with hats standing in a circle amidst the crowd. Several children walk past the group of men with their families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Another clip shows a person wearing a giant penis costume that covers his entire head. The camera captures a young girl sitting in a stroller and staring toward the phallic-costumed individual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Other videos show a group of naked men playing and rinsing themselves off alongside a fountain surrounded by kids. Meanwhile, a stage, clearly adorned with Bud Light branding, featured scantily clad dancers wearing fishnets, nipple stickers and strange sock-like masks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The company's website notes that this year's sponsorship is representative of a longstanding partnership with the Pride event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Bud Light Canada has been a proud partner of Pride Toronto for the last 10 years. This year, we're commemorating this milestone with Pride Toronto by featuring them on our can design, as well as continuing as the official beer sponsor of the festival," the beer brand's website states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the website, Bud Light Canada also provides $100,000 to various organizations that support the LGBTQUA2S+ community across Canada and has created a range of commemorative Pride beer cans to celebrate the collaboration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The partnership comes nearly three months after Bud Light received massive backlash for partnering with trans activist Dylan Mulvaney. The decision angered consumers and the brand saw a significant decrease in sales, resulting in billions of dollars in lost market value.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In early April, Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth attempted to douse the flames with a lengthy statement to customers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer," he said in part. "My time serving this country taught me the importance of accountability and the values upon which America was founded: freedom, hard work and respect for one another. As CEO of Anheuser-Busch, I am focused on building and protecting our remarkable history and heritage."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite losing business, Bud Light continued to anger customers for co-sponsoring an "all-ages Pride event" in Flagstaff, Arizona, on June 17.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The party, called "Pride in the Pines," included drag queens and other performers, and listed Bud Light as one of the companies sponsoring the June 17 event. (Bud Light was initially mentioned prominently in one of the posters.) The event is listed as a "family festival event" and a family-friendly, "safe space" for all visitors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/colorado-springs-club-q-nonbinary-shooting-suspect-pleads-guilty-murder-charges"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/colorado-springs-club-q-nonbinary-shooting-suspect-pleads-guilty-murder-charges</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Colorado Club Q 'nonbinary' shooter sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to murder</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Club Q shooting suspect Anderson Lee Aldrich was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to murder and attempted murder charges during an arraignment hearing Monday morning, avoiding the prospect of a public trail just seven months after the deadly Colorado attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Aldrich, who public defenders have said identifies as nonbinary and prefers to be described using they/them pronouns, is accused of fatally shooting five people and wounding 17 others at the LGBTQ+ nightclub Club Q in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Nov. 19, 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The suspect, whom the judge referred to as "Mx. Aldrich" during Monday&rsquo;s arraignment hearing, accepted a plea agreement for a life sentence without the possibility of parole in exchange for pleading guilty to five counts of first-degree murder. Aldrich also pleaded guilty Monday to 46 counts of attempted murder in the first degree.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The suspect pleaded no contest to felony and misdemeanor charges of bias-motivated crimes. "Because of the evidence presented I believe there is a high probability of being convicted at trial to those counts, and so I am pleading no contest or nolo contendere," Aldrich told the court Monday, explaining the no contest plea.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In an interview from jail, Aldrich reportedly admitted to The Associated Press to being on a "very large plethora of drugs" and abusing steroids at the time, expressing regret for the attack and adding that suggesting the shooting was motivated by hate was "completely off base."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In court hearings earlier this year, law enforcement testified that Aldrich ran a neo-Nazi website and used gay and racial slurs while gaming online, while the defense countered that Aldrich's sometimes abusive mother forced the suspect to frequent LGBTQ+ clubs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Two veterans out at Club Q reportedly helped thwart the attack by disarming Aldrich, who was beaten by patrons and displayed a bruised and bloodied face in his initial mugshot and court appearance. Aldrich was facing more than 300 state counts, including murder and hate crimes. The Justice Department is also considering pursuing federal hate crime charges, according to a senior law enforcement official who spoke to the AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, the charges against Aldrich were thrown out in July 2022 after Aldrich's mother and grandparents, the victims in the case, refused to cooperate with prosecutors, evading efforts to serve them with subpoenas to testify, according to court documents unsealed after the shooting. Other relatives told a judge they feared Aldrich would hurt the grandparents if released, painting a picture of an isolated, violent person who did not have a job and was given $30,000 that was spent largely on the purchase of 3D printers to make guns, the records showed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Aldrich was released from jail then and authorities kept two guns -- a ghost gun pistol and an MM15 rifle &ndash; seized in the arrest. But there was nothing to stop Aldrich from legally purchasing more firearms, raising questions immediately after the shooting about whether authorities should have sought a red flag order to prevent such purchases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nearly-half-bee-colonies-died-2023"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nearly-half-bee-colonies-died-2023</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Nearly half of honey bee colonies died in 2023 after three tumultuous years</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">From April of last year to April of this year, 48% of honey bee colonies prematurely died off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">University of Maryland and Auburn University have collaborated with nonprofit Bee Informed to track and report on managed bee colonies every year since 2007. Last year saw losses of 48%, the previous year&rsquo;s loss was 39%, and the year before that, it was 50.8%. The average loss over the last 12 years is 39.6%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The cause of these losses is a mix of the parasitic mite, varroa destructor, which helps spread viruses between bees, increased use of pesticides, which inhibit the bee's ability to stave off diseases, and dramatic changes in the environment. When it becomes warmer than usual during the winter, bees will leave their colonies to begin pollinating many of the crops we eat, as well as other plants, but when the weather chills again, the bees die off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Still, the most commonly reported cause of death during the winter was the varroa. During the rest of the year, the most common report revolved around issues with the queen bee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"High levels of losses do not necessarily result in a decrease in the total number of colonies managed in the United States because beekeepers can replace lost colonies throughout the year," the report read.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This report comes from a self-reported survey of 3,006 beekeepers from across the United States who collectively manage 314,360 colonies, the majority of which are commercially operated. This is only 12% of the estimated 2.70 million managed honey-producing colonies in the country in 2022, per the report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The collaboration, known as "the Bee Informed Partnership," is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving honey bee colony health in particular.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.conservativereview.com/unable-to-rely-on-wind-and-solar-sweden-ditches-100-renewable-target-and-bets-big-on-nuclear-power-2661896744.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.conservativereview.com/unable-to-rely-on-wind-and-solar-sweden-ditches-100-renewable-target-and-bets-big-on-nuclear-power-2661896744.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Unable to rely on wind and solar, Sweden ditches 100% renewable target and bets big on nuclear power</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Swedish parliament determined last week that in order to ensure the country has a "stable energy system," it will have to abandon its goal of "100 per cent renewable electricity production by 2040."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">To satisfy electricity demand, which is set to double to around 300 TwH by 2040, Sweden's right-of-center government announced June 20 that it would instead lean more heavily on nuclear energy and subsidize the construction of new nuclear plants &mdash; plants green-lit in 2016 but sidelined for fear they would be too expensive, reported Reuters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The country, home to just over 10.5 million people, presently has three nuclear plants with six nuclear reactors in commercial operation. The state-owned Vattenfall aims to bring the tally up to eight reactors and refurbish extant facilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While Sweden's heightened nuclear focus is consistent with the country's commitment to shifting entirely off fossil fuels in a way that doesn't altogether cripple the nation, this bullishness on carbon-free nuclear power represents a significant about-face on atomic energy, which the country decided in a 1980 referendum to phase out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Swedish support for nuclear energy is presently at a record high of 56%, up from 42% in 2022, reported Bloomberg. The jump in support has been attributed in part to the energy crisis that overwhelmed Europe in concert with the invasion of Ukraine and the revelation that renewable energies are not tenable as alternatives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A 2021 study published in the journal Nature Communications indicated, "If future net-zero emissions energy systems rely heavily on solar and wind resources, spatial and temporal mismatches between resource availability and electricity demand may challenge system reliability."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The researchers indicated that "the most reliable renewable electricity systems are wind-heavy and satisfy countries' electricity demand in 72-91% of hours ... Yet even in systems which meet &gt;90% o demand, hundreds of hours of unmet demand may occur annually."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">These lost hours could prove too dear in a country where temperatures routinely drop below freezing several months out of every year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Even the former energy minister for the defeated leftist Social Democratic Party, was cognizant of the country's strained energy situation, warning last August of "strains on the power system this winter," both in terms of outages and high prices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The U.S. Department of Energy indicated that nuclear energy is the most reliable energy source on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. Each nuclear reactor typically produces the same amount of power as 431 utility-scale wind turbines or 3.1 million solar panels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the Swedish government, roughly 75% of its electricity comes from hydroelectric (43%) and nuclear (31%) power. 16% of the electricity comes from wind power. Approximately 9% comes from combined heat and power plants, largely powered by biofuels. Solar energy has yet to crack 1% of total supply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Finance Minister Elisabeth Svan-tesson of the Moderate Party said, "We need more electricity production, we need clean electricity and we need a stable energy system."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Since wind and solar won't cut it, "This creates the conditions for nuclear power," said Svantesson.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<div>What is this universe that we live in? Its full of rocks and dust, hummingbirds and anteaters, black holes and microbials. But is it just stuff? What about the things we cannot see? The things that go bump in the night?</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div>The bible is full of information about the unseen realm of this universe and it also has a lot to say about the conflict taking place in this war torn cosmos.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is the second episode in this new series, so make sure that if you missed the previous episode you go back to hear the groundwork that has been laid.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>
<div>In episode two we diacuss the old gods of the Old Testament and what it looks to see them.potentially return as the crumbling ruins of Christendom no longer provides the protection it once did.</div>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John is desperately injured... Sports, sore hips, and charlie horses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it could be worse!&nbsp; We could be crushed by the ocean while riding in a tin can!</p>
<p>There was a time when men were respected for their courage and willingness to take perilous risks for the sake of potentially great reward. But, in our current society, most people try to mitigate and avoid risk as much as possible. Someone who fails spectacularly isn't encouraged for at least TRYING... he's ridiculed for doing something "stupid" which "could have been avoided."</p>
<p>You've got Christopher Columbus, the Apollo Missions, and Whats-her-name in that strapless gown. What do all of them have in common???</p>
<p>What would cause a person to attempt to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel? Or tighrope walk between skyscrapers?</p>
<p>Later:&nbsp; If you want a good example of concentrated evil, ask The Internet how it feels about Billionaires who lost their lives in a horrific accident. How can people justify SAYING these ugly, despicable things?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's our theory about The Role-Play Game Phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are creating Altar Egos on the internet, and then those Altars are taking over...</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Friday, June 23rd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Dime Payments</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Dime Payments is a Christian owned processing payment business. Every business needs a payment process system, so please go to https://dimepayments.com/flf and sign your business up. Working with them supports us. They wont cancel you, like Stripe canceled President Trump. They wont cancel you, like Mailchimp canceled the Babylon Bee. Check them out. At least have a phone call and tell them that CrossPolitic sent you. Go to https://dimepayments.com/flf.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>US Coast Guard states all 5 aboard lost Titan submersible are dead</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The US Coast Guard confirmed on Thursday that those who were aboard the Titan submersible are now dead. A spokesperson said that the debris that was found shows that the Titan passengers could not have survived the destruction of the pressure chamber.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A Remote Operating Vehicle discovered the debris on Thursday morning. In consultation with experts from within the unified command, the debris is consistent with the catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber." The Coast Guard immediately reached out to the families, and offered their condolences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1671957337308033024"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1671957337308033024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Authorities do not believe that bodies will be recovered, and stated that as to the cause of the destruction, an expert said that the Titanic, or a crash with the Titanic, was not at fault. Instead, they believe it was "an implosion in the water column." This was a "catastrophic implosion."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The timing of the implosion as regards the length of time Titan was underwater before the implosion is not yet known.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A statement released by OceanGate, the company behind the Titan submersible that went missing Sunday after descending to the depths to view the wreckage of the famed, ill-fated luxury liner Titanic, stating that all of those aboard are dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/22/bidens-plan-to-cancel-student-loan-debt-stands-after-house-fails-to-overturn-veto/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/22/bidens-plan-to-cancel-student-loan-debt-stands-after-house-fails-to-overturn-veto/</span></a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden&rsquo;s Plan To Cancel Student Loan Debt Stands After House Fails To Overturn Veto</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Joe Biden&rsquo;s veto of a bill intended to block his plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for some borrowers remains standing after House Republicans failed to garner the two-thirds majority needed to override.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After the Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that Biden&rsquo;s plan was subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA), House Republicans moved to block the president&rsquo;s proposal, The Hill reported.&nbsp; Republicans have argued that student loan forgiveness would cost the American taxpayer $400 billion and is unfair to those who repaid their student loans or didn&rsquo;t attend college.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The subsequent resolution passed both the House and the Democrat-majority Senate after gaining support from Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana, as well as Independent Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. Earlier in June, however, Biden vetoed the resolution, arguing that student loan relief would help offset the financial strains felt by borrowers during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite having enough support to pass the initial resolution, House Republicans failed to garner enough support Wednesday to overcome Biden&rsquo;s veto. The resulting 221-206 vote in the House was among party lines. Although Congress was unable to overturn Biden&rsquo;s veto, the Supreme Court still must rule on the measure. Republican attorney generals and conservative groups have argued that Biden&rsquo;s plan is &ldquo;an illegal abuse of executive power.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg agree to hold cage fight</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires - Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg - have agreed to fight each other in a cage match.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr Musk posted a message on his social media platform Twitter that he was "up for a cage fight" with Mr Zuckerberg.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, then posted a screenshot of Mr Musk's tweet with the caption "send me location".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The story speaks for itself," a Meta spokesperson said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr Musk then replied to Mr Zuckerberg's response with: "Vegas Octagon."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Octagon is the competition mat and fenced-in area used for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. The UFC is based in Las Vegas, Nevada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr Musk, who turns 52 later this month, also tweeted: "I have this great move that I call 'The Walrus', where I just lie on top of my opponent &amp; do nothing."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He later tweeted short videos of walruses, perhaps suggesting his challenge to Mr Zuckerberg may not entirely be serious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/06/dodgers-strange-struggles-continue-in-the-fallout-of-recent-pride-month-controversy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/06/dodgers-strange-struggles-continue-in-the-fallout-of-recent-pride-month-controversy/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Dodgers&rsquo; Strange Struggles Continue In The Fallout Of Recent &lsquo;Pride&rsquo; Month Controversy</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Los Angeles Dodgers&rsquo; 2023 season has been one of the strangest ones that Tinsel Town has ever seen. Between a front office that has struggled to explain the team&rsquo;s social stances and a team that has been playing well below its potential, both manager Dave Roberts and team president Andrew Friedman have been left searching for answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Dodgers are by no means out of the race, sitting in third place in the NL West. They entered play on Wednesday with a 40-33 record, 3.5 games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks. In between Los Angeles and The Snakes stand the second-place Giants, with the Dodgers currently one game behind their rival. In their last 10 games, the Boys in Blue have gone an underwhelming 4-6 and are currently marred by mediocre momentum and morale.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">So, there&rsquo;s still a strong possibility that Roberts leads the squad to another playoff berth, and the year is certainly not a lost cause. There&rsquo;s also no reason to believe that the players suddenly forgot how to hit, catch, and throw, just because of the storm that swirled around the organization recently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Still, it&rsquo;s not a stretch to wonder if all the off-the-field distractions haven&rsquo;t affected the club&rsquo;s psyche. The media scrutiny surrounding the team has been at a fever pitch surrounding their inclusion of the LGBTQ group, The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, at last week&rsquo;s Pride Night event. The organization, often labeled an anti-Catholic hate group, was even awarded during the team&rsquo;s recognition of the LGBTQ community.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">There are now 12 hours of oxygen left in the missing Titan submersible as rescue efforts continue for the five passengers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A Canadian aircraft searching for the sub in the Atlantic Ocean detected intermittent &ldquo;banging&rdquo; noises from the vicinity of its last known location, the US Coast Guard said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Crew searching for the missing sub heard banging sounds every 30 minutes on Tuesday and again four hours later on Wednesday after additional sonar devices were deployed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, the US Coast Guard clarified that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know the source of the noise&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Aboard the Titan is CEO and founder of OceanGate Expeditions Stockton Rush, British billionaire explorer Hamish Harding, renowned French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr Dawood&rsquo;s sister, Sabrina Dawood told Sky News that the Dawood family is solely focused on the rescue of her brother and nephew and hope for their safe return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The watercraft submerged on Sunday morning from its support vessel to travel to the Titanic wreckage which sits at a depth of 12,500ft. About an hour and 45 minutes later, the Titan lost contact with its surface ship, the Polar Prince.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Titan is equipped with a four-day emergency oxygen supply.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Someone wanna tell me why Texas "Christian" University offers a "Queer Art of Drag" class?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hey TCU, I think it's time for a name change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Texas Christian University's Women and Gender Studies department offered a "Queer Art of Drag" class during the Spring 2023 semester. The course required students to give a performance as their own "drag persona."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Drag is an art form with a rich history of challenging dominant norms and systems of oppression; building queer community; and cultivating experiences of queer joy in a hostile world," the course website rads. "Critical drag explores drag performance as an outlet for social critique, and queer world making."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The syllabus also says students must create a "drag vision board," give an "in-class lip-sync performance," and make a "storyboard" for a final performance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A "My Drag Worksheet" assignment required students to create a name, a "drag greeting," a "lip-sync portfolio," and "strike a pose" for their drag persona.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Students were required to give their final presentation using their drag persona voice and submit a video performance for TCU's "Annual Night of Drag."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Why do I suggest TCU change its name? Hmm, let's see&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"A woman shall not wear a man's garment, nor shall a man put on a woman's cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God," Deuteronomy 22:5 (ESV).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://notthebee.com/article/huh-math-and-reading-scores-for-13-year-old-americans-are-the-lowest-theyve-been-in-decades-and-tanked-during-the-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://notthebee.com/article/huh-math-and-reading-scores-for-13-year-old-americans-are-the-lowest-theyve-been-in-decades-and-tanked-during-the-pandemic</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Math and reading scores for 13-year-old Americans are the lowest they've been in decades and tanked during the pandemic</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Remember how we shut down all the schools for a virus that didn't put most children in danger?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The math and reading performance of 13-year-olds in the United States has hit the lowest level in decades, according to test scores released today from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the gold-standard federal exam.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The last time math performance was this low for 13-year-olds was in 1990. In reading, 2004.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Maybe we should have been listening to the experts who predicted "brain drain" and developmental consequences that would set America, and the world at large, back decades in education by shutting down schools for two years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A large body of research shows that most American children experienced academic struggles during the pandemic. It has also been clear that low-income students of color were most heavily affected by school closures and remote learning, which in some districts lasted more than a year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">I heard many experts discussing this from 2020-2022, but most people probably didn't, because the Experts&trade; censored their peers from warning us. And yet the truth remains that some people did actually warn us that closing schools wasn't merely a 2-year setback, but a decision that would affect multiple generations to come.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The 13-year-olds who took this version of the NAEP exam last fall were 10 years old &mdash; and in fourth or fifth grade &mdash; when the pandemic began. Many were old enough to participate in remote learning without minute-to-minute adult assistance, as younger children often needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But the ages of 10 to 13 are also a crucial period for mastering foundational skills, from multiplication to recognizing a character's feelings in a short narrative passage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The bottom line &mdash; these results show that there are troubling gaps in the basic skills of these students," said Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, which gives the NAEP exam. "This is a huge-scale challenge that faces the nation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But it's okay, because proficiency is racist anyway. Civilization might not work without competent, educated people, but we'll feel nice when we're all equal in squalor. We can be the "quit" in equity!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The percentage of 13-year-olds who reported reading for fun has also declined. Last fall, 31 percent said they "never or hardly ever" read for fun, compared to 22 percent in 2012.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Have you looked at the woke books they give these kids? No wonder it's not fun!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Anyway, we might not have to wait long for the end to come, because while we talk about race and gender instead of teaching math, other countries like China are preparing their kids for engineering and war&hellip;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Proposed &lsquo;Hate Speech&rsquo; Law in Michigan Threatens First Amendment Rights, Conservatives Warn</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A bill moving through the Democrat-controlled Michigan State Legislature would make it easier for prosecutors to bring felonious &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; charges against dissident speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The possible implications for preachers, school administrators, teachers, parents, politicians, and citizen activists have alarmed conservatives concerned about the effect the bill may have on free speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The proposed legislation, HB 4474, would amend the state&rsquo;s Ethnic Intimidation Act of 1988 in order to consider it a hate crime if a person is accused of causing &ldquo;severe mental anguish&rdquo; to another individual by means of perceived verbal intimidation or harassment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The amendment defines the words intimidate or harass as a &ldquo;willful course of conduct, involving repeated or continuing harassment of another individual that would cause a reasonable individual to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Words are malleable,&rdquo; Attorney David Kallman of the Great Lakes Justice Center (GLJC), a non-profit legal organization dedicated to preserving liberty in America, told The Epoch Times. &ldquo;They can be redefined by whoever is in power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Under the proposed statute, &lsquo;intimidate and harass&rsquo; can mean whatever the victim, or the authorities, want them to mean. The focus is on how the victim feels rather than on a clearly defined criminal act. This is a ridiculously vague and subjective standard,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The absence of intent makes no difference under this law. You are still guilty of the crime because the victim felt uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The bill will lead to the prosecution of conservatives, pastors, and parents attending a school board meeting for simply expressing their opposition to the liberal agenda,&rdquo; Kallman said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A convicted violator could receive a fine of up to $10,000, up to five years in prison, or both.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The bill does provide the court with the option of an alternative sentence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The text reads in part, &ldquo;An alternative sentence may include an order requiring the offender to complete a period of community service intended to enhance the offender&rsquo;s understanding of the impact of the offense upon the victim and wider community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, testified that Michigan has the fifth-highest number of hate crimes committed per capita in the United States, with many more incidents not reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">She stated that HB 4474, and similar early judicial intervention measures, can help prevent initial non-violent hate crimes from escalating into murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;You can literally save lives,&rdquo; Nessel, a lesbian, told the committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney Kim Worthy, a Democrat, called the existing Ethnic Intimidation Law &ldquo;woefully inadequate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">She testified that HB 4474 was a &ldquo;useful tool&rdquo; that would make it &ldquo;easier to prosecute real hate crimes&rdquo; and send a message that they are &ldquo;absolutely intolerable in this state.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We have to protect our victims of hate crimes,&rdquo; Worthy said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Top Disney Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion Officer Leaving The Company</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Disney&rsquo;s top Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) officer will be leaving the entertainment giant to &ldquo;pursue other endeavors&rdquo; as the company continues to face headwinds from conservative customers over its promotion of LGBT themes and battles with Florida Republicans, according to a memo obtained by Variety.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">An internal memo sent to employees this week announced that Latondra Newton, the company&rsquo;s chief DEI officer and senior vice president, would be moving on from the company, Variety reported Tuesday. Newton will reportedly be moving to a board at a different corporation after six years at Disney.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing to share the news that Latondra Newton has decided to leave The Walt Disney Company to pursue other endeavors,&rdquo; the internal memo obtained by Variety read. &ldquo;Working alongside all of you and so many others, she has inspired countless cast members and employees to bring about lasting change and to help create a world where we can all feel safe and we all belong.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Julie Merges, currently a human resources executive at the company, will be the interim top DEI officer while a hiring search is conducted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At Disney, Newton worked &ldquo;with various business segments and leaders across the enterprise to build on Disney&rsquo;s commitment to produce entertainment that reflects a global audience and sustains a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone,&rdquo; according to the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Newton signed on to a letter from top Disney executives taking aim at &ldquo;racial disparities&rdquo; following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis resolving to pursue &ldquo;real change.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Under Newton, Disney also began its &ldquo;Reimagine Tomorrow&rdquo; program which focused on &ldquo;representation&rdquo; for a host of different groups including increasing &ldquo;gender diversity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Black Representation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Female empowerment,&rdquo; &ldquo;Diverse Families,&rdquo; &ldquo;LGBTQIA+ Representation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Middle Eastern Representation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In recent years, Disney has come under fire from some customers over its insertion of LGBT themes into children&rsquo;s content, including the inclusion of a gay kiss into the 2022 &ldquo;Lightyear&rdquo; film which flopped at the box office. The company also voiced opposition to a Florida law intended to shield kids from being taught gender ideology and sexual topics in the classroom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The company has also faced backlash online after video emerged of a man in a dress welcoming small children into a Disneyland boutique full of princess costumes.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, June 21st, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/its-official-student-loan-payments-will-restart-in-october.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/its-official-student-loan-payments-will-restart-in-october.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>It&rsquo;s official: Student loan payments will restart in October, Education Department says</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Over the three-year-long pause on student loan payments, the U.S. Department of Education has repeatedly told borrowers their bills were set to resume, only to take it back and provide them more time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This time, however, the agency really means it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Education Department posted on its website that &ldquo;payments will be due starting in October,&rdquo; and a recent law passed by Congress will make changing that plan difficult.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It will likely be a big adjustment for borrowers when the pandemic-era policy expires. Around 40 million Americans have debt from their education. The typical monthly bill is roughly $350.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;For many borrowers, the payment pause has been life altering &mdash; saving many from financial ruin and allowing others to finally get ahead financially,&rdquo; said Persis Yu, deputy executive director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Donald Trump first announced the stay on federal student loan bills and the accrual of interest in March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. and crippled the economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The pause has since been extended eight times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Nearly all people eligible for the relief have taken advantage of it, with less than 1% of qualifying borrowers continuing to make payments on their education debt, according to an analysis by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As a result of the policy, the average borrower likely saved around $15,000 in student loan payments, Kantrowitz said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Education Department notes on its financial aid website that &ldquo;Congress recently passed a law preventing further extensions of the payment pause.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It is referring to the agreement reached between Republicans and Democrats to raise the nation&rsquo;s debt ceiling, which President Joe Biden signed into law in early June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In exchange for voting to increase the borrowing limit, Republicans demanded large cuts to federal spending. They sought to repeal Biden&rsquo;s executive action granting student loan forgiveness, but the Biden administration refused to agree to that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, included in the deal was a provision that officially terminates the pause at the end of August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Even before that agreement, the Biden administration had been preparing borrowers for their payments to resume by September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Education Department says borrowers will be expected to make their first post-pause payment in October. Meanwhile, interest will start accumulating on borrowers&rsquo; debt again on Sept. 1, the department says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As the Biden administration tries to ready millions of Americans to restart their student loan payments, there&rsquo;s one big open question that may make that preparation difficult: Most borrowers don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll owe in the fall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">That&rsquo;s because the Supreme Court has yet to issue a verdict on the validity of Biden&rsquo;s plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for borrowers. A decision is expected this month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Around 37 million people would be eligible for some loan cancellation, Kantrowitz estimated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Roughly a third of those with federal student loans, or 14 million people, would have their balances entirely forgiven by the president&rsquo;s program, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. As a result, these borrowers won&rsquo;t owe anything come October.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">For those who still have a balance after the relief, the Education Department has said it plans to &ldquo;re-amortize&rdquo; borrowers&rsquo; lower debts. That&rsquo;s a wonky term that means it will recalculate people&rsquo;s monthly payment based on their lower tab and the number of months they have left on their repayment timeline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Kantrowitz provided an example: Let&rsquo;s say a person currently owes $30,000 in student loans at a 5% interest rate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Before the pandemic, they would have paid around $320 a month on a 10-year repayment term. If forgiveness goes through and that person gets $10,000 in relief, their total balance would be reduced by a third, and their monthly payment will drop by a third, to roughly $210 a month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal recently warned that if the administration is unable to deliver on Biden&rsquo;s loan forgiveness, delinquency and default rates could skyrocket.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The borrowers most in jeopardy of defaulting are those for whom Biden&rsquo;s policy would have wiped out their balance entirely, Kvaal said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/madelineleesman/2023/06/19/ny-post-teacher-called-a-student-despicable-after-questioning-her-classmate-who-identifies-as-a-cat-n2624666"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/madelineleesman/2023/06/19/ny-post-teacher-called-a-student-despicable-after-questioning-her-classmate-who-identifies-as-a-cat-n2624666</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Teacher Reportedly Calls Student &lsquo;Despicable&rsquo; for Challenging Peer Who &lsquo;Identifies As a Cat&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A 13-year-old girl and her friend were reportedly called &ldquo;despicable&rdquo; by one of their schoolteachers last week after one of them challenged their classmates about &ldquo;how she identifies as a cat" after a lesson about gender ideology.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The 13-year-old girl and her friend are reportedly students at Rye College in the United Kingdom. The school is affiliated with the Church of England, according to the New York Post. The students were in their end-of-year lesson on &ldquo;life education&rdquo; where they were told they can&rdquo;be who you want to be and how you identify is up to you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">After the lesson, one of the students asked her classmate: &ldquo;How can you identify as a cat when you&rsquo;re a girl?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As a result, the schoolteacher reprimanded the student and her friend and said that they were being reported to school officials. And, the teacher reportedly said that they would no longer be welcome at the school if they &ldquo;continued to express the view that only boys and girls exist&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The girls informed the teacher that their parents would agree with their views on gender ideology, that someone's gender is not different than their biological sex.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s very sad as well then,&rdquo; the teacher reportedly said in response, adding that &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t like it you need to go to a different school.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A parent of another student at the school told The Telegraph that &ldquo;what bothers me is the shutting down of debate in such a threatening and aggressive manner, which I don&rsquo;t believe is appropriate in an educational setting.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Regardless of the subject, education should serve to build awareness of differing points of view to widen the understanding of a subject. It shouldn&rsquo;t be a case of indoctrination,&rdquo; the parent added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/crime-so-out-of-control-in-san-francisco-stores-are-locking-up-candy?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/crime-so-out-of-control-in-san-francisco-stores-are-locking-up-candy?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Crime so out of control in San Francisco, stores are locking up candy</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78gt7pfjlCU"><strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78gt7pfjlCU</strong></a><strong> - Play Video - 1:26-1:4</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">San Francisco residents that are looking to satisy a sweet tooth will have to go through a series of extra steps as candy is now being locked up in stores amid rising crime in the not so 'golden' city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While Butterfingers, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Starbursts, and M&amp;M's are locked up behind bars, illegal drugs are readily available for consumers as they flow rampant down the city's streets that are plagued by urine, human feces, and homeless vagrants looking for their next hit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In order to fend off thieves, San Francisco store owners have taken extra measures to combat rampant retail theft and are locking up merchandise up and down store aisles, which now includes candy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A photo taken by the Daily Mail at a Walgreens store shows a mixture of America's favorite chocolate and gummy candies confined behind a sheer box with a lock on it. If consumers want to purchase a KitKat or a Hershey's Kiss, they will have to ring an alarm for a store associate to come and assist them in grabbing the item off of the shelf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A security guard at the Walgreens on Powell Street which is home to San Francisco's famous cable cars told Daily Mail that, "Theft is constant."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He told the outlet that a homeless man who stole from the store earlier in the day appeared a few hours later only to commit another theft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Major businesses and retailers have recently announced that they are shuttering their locations in the once-booming downtown corridor, with all citing similar reasons for the departures: rampant retail theft, loss of foot traffic, homeless vagrants attacking employees, and other safety concerns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">These businesses include Nordstroms, Whole Foods, T-Mobile, Walgreens, Old Navy, and now the entire Westfield shopping center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">While the San Francisco City Council has weaponized the local criminal justice system, turning it into a revolving door for repeat offenders and enacting laws that prevent police making arrests for petty theft, a Muslim immigrant and business owner, whose store was recently ransacked by a pack of thieves, said that crime in the city is now worse than it is in both Afghanistan and Iraq.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/biden-admin-gave-university-over-2m-for-monitoring-microaggressions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/biden-admin-gave-university-over-2m-for-monitoring-microaggressions/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Biden Admin Gave University Over $2M For &lsquo;Monitoring Microaggressions&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The National Institutes of Health has, since September 2021, been funding a $2.2 million program at the University of Miami examining how "microaggressions" affect "Black cisgender queer women" who have HIV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to a grant listing from the Department of Health and Human Services, the program, known as Monitoring Microaggressions and Adversities to Generate Interventions for Change, seeks to discover how "comments, jokes, and behaviors that are demeaning to a marginalized group" affect health outcomes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Queer black women with HIV "live at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities and within social structures that take a daily toll," the grant description states. However, the impact of microaggressions on this group has "largely been ignored."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The program is supervised by Sannisha Dale, an associate professor of psychology, who chairs the department&rsquo;s Diversity and Equity Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Dale's first contact with the project was in 2019, according to the University&rsquo;s website. Through text messages and regular visits, the grant team monitored 151 women to understand how microaggressions affected their daily levels of distress and consumption of medication.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"[Microagressions] can be someone saying, &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look like she&rsquo;s positive,&rsquo; as if HIV has a face," Dale said. "Or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m HIV negative, I&rsquo;m clean,&rsquo; as if someone else is dirty."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Biden administration has shown a willingness to shell out cash for LGBT initiatives. Biden&rsquo;s most recent budget proposal included a $400 million State Department program to help LGBTQ Africans access the internet. In January, the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded a grant to translate a gay dictionary into Spanish.</span></p>]]></description>
