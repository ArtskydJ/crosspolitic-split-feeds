Pink, noted 20th century theologian, to look at whether we can know what we should be doing&mdash;in our lives and our politics&mdash;if we do not understand the various covenants in the Bible. &nbsp;As Pink notes, the temporal covenants reveal to us &ldquo;the divine side&rdquo; of what God planned to do with his creation, from beginning to the end, even before He created.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/child-allegedly-shoots-two-teens-at-football-practice-over-bag-of-chips"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/child-allegedly-shoots-two-teens-at-football-practice-over-bag-of-chips</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Child allegedly shoots two teens at football practice over 'bag of chips'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An 11-year-old was arrested Monday after allegedly opening fire at a Pop Warner youth football practice in Apopka, Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police say that while only one shot was fired, two kids were ultimately struck &mdash; one in the back and the other in the arm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suspect is presently facing one count of attempted second-degree murder, though Apopka Police Chief Michael McKinley indicated prosecutors may pursue additional charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WOFL-TV reported that the APD received a report of a shooting around 8:20 p.m. near a football field at the Northwest Recreation Center on Jason Dwelley Parkway where a kids' soccer game was also taking place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 911 call obtained by WESH-TV, one victim's mother can be heard saying, "My son got shot, miss! ... In his back!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first officer arrived on the scene just four minutes later, finding one victim on the ground and another victim holding his grazed elbow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two victims, both 13 years old, were taken to Arnold Palmer Hospital and are expected to make a full recovery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveillance footage shows juveniles crewing at the edge of the parking lot around 8:17 p.m., some still wearing their football jerseys.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first victim, a heavy-set male with red shorts, can be seen chasing the alleged shooter toward his mother's vehicle around 8:18 p.m. Seconds later, the suspect opens the front passenger door and reaches into the vehicle, where his mother was reportedly in the driver's seat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside and under the passenger seat was a purple handgun, according to the arrest report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandishing the weapon, the suspect appears to turn the tables and chase the heavy-set victim, ultimately firing one shot into the victim's back. The same round proceeded to graze the second victim's elbow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shooting, WOFL indicated the alleged shooter was brought back to his mother's vehicle. He is now being held at a juvenile detention center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the arrest report, some witnesses claimed the victims had been "bullying" the alleged shooter. Others suggested the dispute was over "a bag of chips," reported the Orlando Sentinel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apopka Police Chief Michael McKinley told reporters, "It's unbelievable that young kids out here to play football and have a good time would get into an altercation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinley indicated the APD would be pursuing second-degree misdemeanor charges against the mother for allegedly having her firearm in an unlocked box, reported WKMG-TV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange-Osceola State Attorney Andrew Bain, who took over for Monique Worrell after her suspension by Gov. Ron DeSantis, said his office will ensure there will be a reckoning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The level of violence unacceptable right now, especially from our youth," said Bain. "We&rsquo;re going to stand strong to deal with those cases and try to end or put a big slow-down to what&rsquo;s going on in the streets right now."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apopka Pop Warner canceled its Wednesday practice, noting in a statement, "One of our players was involved in a shooting incident that resulted in the injury of two players. We are deeply saddened by this event and our thoughts and prayers are with the families affected."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/10/04/uk-announced-new-zealand-style-plan-to-ban-smoking-altogether/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/10/04/uk-announced-new-zealand-style-plan-to-ban-smoking-altogether/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UK Announces New Zealand Style Plan to Ban Smoking Altogether</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Kingdom is to phase out smoking altogether, the government says, by banning young people from buying cigarettes at all with a minimum age to buy rising from 18 every year until there isn&rsquo;t anyone left alive old enough to enjoy the habit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced his intention to steer the UK towards becoming tobacco-free by increasing the minimum age to buy products every year from here on, so the teenagers of today will never be old enough to legally take the habit up. Sunak acknowledged restricting personal freedoms was not always an easy choice for an instinctive Conservative but &mdash; underlining the way government decisions are driven by socialised healthcare &mdash; said it was important because smokers cost taxpayers through needing more hospital care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is about &ldquo;preventative care&rdquo; to keep people out of hospitals, the Prime Minister said and told his governing party&rsquo;s annual conference that: &ldquo;I propose that in future, we raise the smoking age by one year every year. That means a 14-year-old today will never legally be sold a cigarette, and that they and their generation can grow up smoke-free&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This would work, Sunak said, because the UK&rsquo;s previous experience with increasing the smoking age from 16 to 18 saw a drop in the number of people starting smoking. The Prime Minister said he would also look at cracking down on &lsquo;vapes&rsquo;, the electronic tobacco alternative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report explaining the system as already implemented in New Zealand, which is becoming known for its draconian health interventions, stated in 2022:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law states that tobacco can&rsquo;t ever be sold to anybody born on or after January 1, 2009 &ndash; and from now on, the minimum age for buying cigarettes will keep going up and up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, somebody trying to buy a pack of cigarettes 50 years from now would need ID to show they were at least 63 years old. But health authorities hope smoking will fade away well before then. They have a stated goal of making New Zealand smoke-free by 2025.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand also took other measures in its law shakeup, including making getting hold of cigarettes more difficult for those who could legally use them. They are no longer sold in regular stores, but can only be bought at specialist tobacconists, cutting the number of locations where smokes are sold nationwide from thousands of locations to hundreds.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/biden-faa-nominee-promises-end-work-from-home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/biden-faa-nominee-promises-end-work-from-home</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden pick to lead FAA promises hard push to end work-from-home policies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Federal Aviation Administration would prioritize ending pandemic telework policies for federal employees and bring the out-of-date agency into the 21st century.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker told Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee members during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday that, if approved, he would focus heavily on matters with agency employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I do believe that it's important to be in person for collaboration and working together," said Whitaker, a pilot and former aviation industry executive. "This has been a challenging issue for all organizations, private or public. And I think what needs to happen is after understanding the situation that we're in and the limitations that might be there, issuing very clear guidance, what the expectations are to get people in the office."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, the FAA announced that employees would have to return to the office no fewer than three days per week starting on Oct. 9. The union pushed back against a 100% return to office, complicating the agency's attempt to reinstate the policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) egged Whitaker on over the work-from-home policies and claimed the federal government was the only employer that had not returned to pre-pandemic policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When I talk to businesses in the private sector, virtually all of them, employees are going back to work, and they're physically present. And yet, throughout the Biden administration, we have a pattern in just about every agency where large portions of the workforce have apparently decided going into the office is optional," Cruz said. "That seriously limits the effectiveness of an agency and particularly an agency whose mission is protecting people's lives and the airspace."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by Cruz if he would commit to "working diligently" to bring employees back into the office, Whitaker agreed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitaker was second in command at the FAA from 2012 through 2015. The agency has had a gap in leadership over the past 18 months. Returning to the FAA at this point, Whitaker said, would warrant three actions he would take in his five-year term as administrator.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"First, I will work not just to maintain the safety record we have collectively achieved but build upon it. The two Boeing MAX crashes remind us that we must be ever-vigilant," Whitaker said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency ought to ensure gaps in the FAA certification process are closed so that undisclosed changes manufacturers make to aircraft can still be caught before being put into use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, the FAA should be more "agile and creative" and willing to "adapt quickly" and plan for the future rather than focus on the present.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FAA has but one academy that takes years to complete, and it can only accommodate 1,800 air traffic controllers at a time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitaker's final point was that the government should make the FAA a place where people interested in aviation careers, particularly air traffic controllers, want to work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was tasked with hiring 6,000 air traffic controllers during his previous stint at the FAA but came up far short.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/05/rnc-republican-presidential-primary-debates-donald-trump/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/05/rnc-republican-presidential-primary-debates-donald-trump/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Even The RNC&rsquo;s Own Members Are Admitting Trump-less Debates May Be A Waste Of Time</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the Republican National Committee (RNC) are frustrated with the current direction of their GOP primary debates, admitting that without President Donald Trump the events may not be worth it, according to Politico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Trump has skipped the first two presidential debates, a decision that has drawn criticism from rival candidates. After the first two debates were widely panned, some within the RNC think they need the President on the stage to make the forums worth it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think the only way you salvage it is if you get the frontrunner there,&rdquo; Tyler Bowyer, a national committeeman from Arizona, told Politico. &ldquo;Plan a debate where you get the frontrunner to agree to it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first GOP presidential debate, sponsored by the conservative youth organization Young America&rsquo;s Foundation (YAF), was aired exclusively on Fox News, Fox Business and Rumble. The debate was moderated by Fox News&rsquo; Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second debate was aired by the exact same networks, in addition to Spanish-language network Univision. The moderators included Univision anchor Ilia Calder&oacute;n, Fox Business host Stuart Varney and Fox News host Dana Perino.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That debate fell flat, with many prominent conservative media figures criticizing the moderators for asking poor questions while candidates bickered and talked over one another. The RNC previously promised in 2022 to use debates to &ldquo;raise conservative media up&rdquo; and incorporate other outlets, but after the first two debates, conservative media companies outside of the mainstream media told the Daily Caller that they are feeling snubbed by the committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t put your head in the sand and pretend these debates are going to result in someone other than Donald Trump getting the nomination,&rdquo; Patti Lyman, the RNC&rsquo;s national committeewoman from Virginia, told Politico, adding that the debates were &ldquo;embarrassing&rdquo; and &ldquo;reflected very poorly on our party.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some members pushing for Trump to take the debate stage, top officials are reportedly not attempting to get the front runner on the debate stage, a person with knowledge of the committee&rsquo;s operations told Politico. That reportedly includes RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and chairman for the RNC&rsquo;s Temporary Committee on Presidential Debates David Bossie.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump himself doesn&rsquo;t think the debates should go on; the President told the Daily Caller that the RNC &ldquo;has to stop the debates&rdquo; because they are &ldquo;bad for the Republican party.&rdquo; Trump and his advisors have additionally urged the RNC to &ldquo;refocus its manpower and money&rdquo; on election integrity efforts rather than the debates, Politico reported.</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Thursday, October 5th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Redballoon</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Not so long ago, the American dream was alive and well. Employees who worked hard were rewarded, and employers looked for people who could do the job, not for people who had the right political views.&nbsp; RedBalloon.work is a job site designed to get us back to what made American businesses successful: free speech, hard work, and having fun.&nbsp; If you are a free speech employer who wants to hire employees who focus on their work and not identity politics, then post a job on RedBalloon.&nbsp; If you are an employee who is being censored at work or is being forced to comply with the current zeitgeist, post your resume on RedBalloon and look for a new job. redballoon.work, the job site where free speech is still alive!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="http://www.redballoon.work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.redballoon.work</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2023/10/03/the-guardian-climate-change-has-made-rainstorms-20-wetter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2023/10/03/the-guardian-climate-change-has-made-rainstorms-20-wetter/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>The Guardian: Climate Change Has Made Rainstorms &lsquo;20% Wetter&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The UK-based Guardian newspaper has made the remarkable assertion that rainstorms are now 20 percent &ldquo;wetter&rdquo; than they used to be, thanks to climate change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">New York City&rsquo;s recent storm and accompanying flooding show the &ldquo;unmistakable influence of the climate crisis,&rdquo; the Guardian contended Monday, warning the city may not be &ldquo;prepared for severe climate shocks.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The type of storm seen on Friday &ldquo;is now 10-20% wetter than it would have been in the previous century, because of climate change,&rdquo; the Guardian alleged, citing a new &ldquo;rapid attribution study.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Guardian said that such a pounding rainfall is &ldquo;a symptom of a warming planet&rdquo; because a hotter atmosphere is &ldquo;able to hold more moisture.&rdquo; Curiously, at this time last year, the Guardian declared that droughts are &ldquo;at least 20 times more likely&rdquo; than without &ldquo;human-caused global heating.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Monday&rsquo;s article, the newspaper cited climate expert Tommaso Alberti, who said the rainstorm that hit New York was predictable and &ldquo;aligns with climate change projections.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Human-driven climate change is the &ldquo;primary driver&rdquo; of major storms, which underscores &ldquo;the urgent need for climate mitigation and adaptation efforts,&rdquo; Alberti argued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michael Mann, who invented the thoroughly debunked hockey stick graph and has falsely presented himself as a Nobel Prizewinner, agreed that the New York storm was clearly attributable to global warming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;New York is experiencing a very clear increase in these extreme &ndash; more than 2in per hour &ndash; rainfall events, and that&rsquo;s clearly tied to a warming atmosphere,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Rohit Aggarwala, the New York City commissioner of environmental protection, has also blamed the city&rsquo;s reprehensible response to the storm on climate change, a convenient, if mendacious, dog-ate-my-homework excuse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The sad reality is our climate is changing faster than our infrastructure can respond,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Daniel Zarrilli, the former chief climate policy adviser to New York City, uttered similar lamentations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that our cities and our aging infrastructure were built for a climate that no longer exists, particularly as a warmed atmosphere holds and releases more water,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Reuters joined in the climate change blame game as well, suggesting that New York City&rsquo;s flooding is just part of the &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; ushered in by global warming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/trudeaus-internet-censorship-plan-kicks-off-with-government-operated-streaming-registry?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/trudeaus-internet-censorship-plan-kicks-off-with-government-operated-streaming-registry?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trudeau's internet censorship plan kicks off with government-operated streaming registry</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Friday's announcement from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) that online streaming services in Canada must register with the government agency has sent a chill throughout independent media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Critics say it is the beginning of a broad registry of all online news media, even if the CRTC is currently maintaining that a $10 million threshold exists for broadcasters before they must register.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Previous CRTC vice-chairman and former editor of the Calgary Herald posted Monday on X: "Essentially and eventually, @crtceng intends to regulate everything on the Internet pretty much the way it regulates TV, radio and cable. Say g'bye to a free and open internet in Canada."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Noted journalist Glenn Greenwald posted on X: "The Canadian government, armed with one of the world's most repressive online censorship schemes, announces that all "online streaming services that offer podcasts" must formally register with the government to permit regulatory controls."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a news release, the CRTC announced that it is setting out which online streaming services need to provide information about their activities in Canada. Online streaming services that operate in Canada, offer broadcasting content, and earn $10 million or more in annual revenues will need to complete a registration form by November 28, 2023."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The declaration is part of the Trudeau government's Online Streaming Act, or Bill C-11, which was called a "dangerous first step towards government control of the internet" by Justice Centre for Constitution Freedoms President John Carpay, who wrote that "In the long run, the CRTC could end up regulating much of the content posted on major social media, even where the content is generated or uploaded by religious, political, and charitable non-profits."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, reading further down in the news release, the CRTC uses ambiguous language and apparently contradicts its own guidelines by stating, "online services that offer podcasts must register; however, individuals who use social media to share podcasts do not."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The CRTC has previously stated that: "individuals that host podcasts on their own websites or make them available on a subscription service platform other than a social media service are not explicitly excluded from the Broadcasting Act under subsection 2(2.1)"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist was quick to comprehensively comment on the CRTC announcement in an essay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Geist suggested the government's plans are "not as bad as critics would suggest, but not nearly as benign as the CRTC would have you believe."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But Geist says the real danger of the CRTC's announcement is that it is "the thin edge of the wedge with the registration requirement being the first step toward a far broader regulatory framework."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"In fact, the rationale for the CRTC to include many of the services is that without such information it is not well positioned to regulate. This creates an obvious contradiction: the Commission claims that the registration requirement is de minimis requiring the disclosure of only limited information but then also argues that such information is important to future decision making on compliance with the Broadcasting Act objectives," he writes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The CRTC hints that a broad registry is in the works: that "exempting online undertakings that provide news services from the requirement to register would prevent the Commission from having an adequate understanding of the players providing such services. Without information about the online broadcasting undertakings involved in the Canadian broadcasting system, it would be much harder for the Commission to develop policies aimed at implementing the above-noted policy objectives of the Broadcasting Act and conform to the proposed direction."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The CRTC says "[a] third consultation is ongoing. It considers contributions traditional broadcasters and online streaming services will need to make to support Canadian and Indigenous content. The CRTC will hold a three-week public proceeding starting on November 20, 2023, and will hear from 129 intervenors representing a broad range of interests."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Swiss writer who called journalist 'fat lesbian' sentenced to 60 days in prison, LGBTQ groups applaud decision</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A court in Switzerland sentenced a writer and commentator to 60 days in jail for calling a journalist a "fat lesbian," and the decision is being lauded by LGBTQ+ groups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Monday, French-Swiss polemicist Alain Bonnet, who goes by Alain Soral, was sentenced by the Lausanne court for the crimes of defamation, discrimination and incitement to hatred after he criticized Catherine Macherel, a journalist for Swiss newspapers Tribune de Geneve and 24 Heures, in a Facebook video two years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"This court decision is an important moment for justice and rights of LGBTQI people in Switzerland," said Murial Waeger, co-director of a lesbian activist group. "The conviction of Alain Soral is a strong signal that homophobic hatred cannot be tolerated in our society."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In addition to the prison time, Soral was subsequently ordered to pay legal fees and fines totaling thousands of Swiss francs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Soral&rsquo;s sentencing came after he called Macherel a "fat lesbian," criticized her work as a "queer activist" and said she was "unhinged" in a social media video, according to Swiss public broadcaster RTS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Pascal Junod, a lawyer for Soral, mockingly blasted the conviction for a "crime of opinion" in an email to The Associated Press. He said the case aimed to probe whether a person had "sinned against the dogmas of single thought."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Soral will appeal to Swiss federal court and "if necessary" to the European Court of Human Rights, his lawyer added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In 2020, Swiss voters approved a measure that made it illegal to discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This conviction was not the first time Soral has gotten into trouble over his words as he was previously and repeatedly convicted in France for denying the Holocaust, which is a crime in France. He was sentenced to jail time in 2019 over the denials.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/03/sports-governing-body-scraps-open-category-trans-athletes-no-one-signs-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/03/sports-governing-body-scraps-open-category-trans-athletes-no-one-signs-up/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Sports Governing Body Scraps &lsquo;Open&rsquo; Category For Trans Athletes After No One Signs Up</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">World Aquatics (WA), the international water sports governing body, announced in a press release Tuesday that it is getting rid of its transgender &ldquo;open&rdquo; category for the 2023 World Cup since no athletes had decided to sign up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">WA said in August that it was opening a category for athletes to swim the 50-meter and 100-meter distances regardless of gender. After athletes failed to show, WA decided to scrap the category for the World Cup in Berlin, Germany, from Oct. 6 to Oct. 8 but noted that the &ldquo;Open Category Working Group&rdquo; would still consider reopening the division if demand increased in the future, according to the press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;The World Aquatics Open Category Working Group will continue its work and engagement with the aquatics community on Open Category events,&rdquo; the announcement reads. &ldquo;Even if there is no current demand at the elite level, the working group is planning to look at the possibility of including Open Category races at Masters events in the future.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">WA originally planned to debut the open category in July in Fukuoka, Japan, during its congressional meeting but later decided against it. The organization announced its new &ldquo;gender inclusion policy&rdquo; in 2022, which made it possible to create the &ldquo;open category&rdquo; for future competitions and required male athletes looking to compete in the female division to have transitioned and experienced no puberty symptoms before the age of 12, as well maintaining regular testosterone levels below 2.5 nanomoles per liter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;When World Aquatics instituted its Policy on Eligibility for the Men&rsquo;s and Women&rsquo;s Competition Categories, we committed to exploring the creation of an open category,&rdquo; World Aquatics President Husain Al-Musallam said, according to the press release. &ldquo;True to our word, a team of experts has diligently worked to make this a reality. I would like to thank all those who have helped World Aquatics to deliver this opportunity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Other sport governing bodies have opted to not allow transgender athletes to compete in divisions outside of their biological sex, such as the International Cycling Union, which announced in July that males who had transitioned after puberty could not compete in the female category. The International Angling Sports Federation made a similar decision on Sept. 29 after England&rsquo;s team said that it would boycott the world championship if men were allowed to compete with women.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian government&rsquo;s passage of legislation such as Bills C-11, C-18, and C-36 is beginning to bear fruit, in the form of increasingly invasive censorship policies levied on content platforms. All civilizations practice censorship, making decisions for the type of material that is suitable for public viewing; the difference is in the standard of judging and how it is applied. We should not be afraid of truth, even when it offends our own sensibilities. Rather, the testing of our opinions and assumptions against competing claims is a primary means for us to grow in knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-kevin-mccarthy-removed-as-house-speaker?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-kevin-mccarthy-removed-as-house-speaker?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kevin McCarthy REMOVED as House Speaker</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to oust Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final tally showed 216 in favor of the motion to vacate, while 210 were opposed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though McCarthy is no longer third in line to the presidency, he will retain his seat. The House will now have to decide who, if anyone, has enough votes to take over as Speaker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) will act as Speaker pro tempore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier Tuesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) stood and repeated his motion to vacate. Rep Tom Cole (R-OK) rose to offer to table that motion. The 15-minute vote saw 208 Republicans vote in favor of McCarthy's leadership, and 11 against. All Democrats were in favor of vacating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a 60-minute back and forth between those for and against vacating McCarthy's position, the final vote was taken.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaetz was able to initiate proceedings on his own thanks to the inclusion of the Jeffersonian Motion in the deal made when McCarthy accepted the Speakership in January. Under the agreement, a single person was permitted to introduce a motion to remove McCarthy if he "goes back on his word or policy agenda."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the months since, McCarthy has been criticized by members of his own party for decisions regarding the appropriation of funds to Ukraine, among other things. He recently drew ire from Gaetz and his crew for teaming up with Democrats to pass a 45-day stopgap resolution to keep the government running, despite there not being a properly passed continuing resolution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You don't know chaos until you've seen where this Congress and this uniparty is bringing us," the Florida Congressman said in response to suggestions from reporters that removing the Speaker would throw the House into disarray.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), disagreed with Gaetz, and indicated that they would support McCarthy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I agree with you we need serious change," Greene said, "but there is no plan and no one capable even stepping up. Last time Freedom Caucus threw out a Speaker, we ended up with Paul Ryan who did not support President Trump&rsquo;s agenda. Nothing can truly change until Trump is back in the WH."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the vote, McCarthy admitted it was "likely" that he would be vacated, noting that if all Democrats sided against him, they would only need five Republican votes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/03/dnc-officials-minorities-representation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/03/dnc-officials-minorities-representation/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DNC Officials Are Freaking Out Because They Can&rsquo;t Get Enough Minorities To Represent Them</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-ranking officials at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) are expressing significant worries that the committee is not meeting its self-established minority representation goals, Politico reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six present and former committee members are increasingly fretting about the lack of desired diversity among delegates selected to attend the 2023 DNC convention, according to Politico. At the same time, President Joe Biden&rsquo;s campaign is hemorrhaging minority support, which is crucial for securing a second term.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I keep looking at these diversity goals in big states like New York, like California. And, for some reason, whether it&rsquo;s the African American community, Black community, the LGBTQ+ community, or Hispanic community, [the] numbers continue to decrease,&rdquo; political strategist and former chair of the DNC Donna Brazile stated at a recent committee meeting in Washington, D.C., according to Politico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It raises a red flag in my judgment,&rdquo; Brazile told Politico in an interview. &ldquo;And then I try to find out what the hell is it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&rsquo;s support among black, Latino and Asian voters plummeted from 63% in July to 47%, according to a Monmouth University poll published on Monday. The poll also found that Trump&rsquo;s support from these demographics increased from 23% to 33% over the same period of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DNC employs a formula to determine delegate diversity figures, which is tailored for each state and considers factors like census data and Democrat-leaning status, according to Politico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If African Americans are 10 percent of the population, they&rsquo;re usually like 15-20 percent of the Democratic vote,&rdquo; political scientist and DNC member Elaine Kamarck stated, according to Politico. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how the math starts to work for the affirmative action goals.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden won the 2020 presidential election with support from more than 70% of nonwhite voters, according to The New York Times.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disturbing video shows moment beloved activist, poet is randomly stabbed to death in front of girlfriend on NYC street</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disturbing new video shows the moment an activist and poet was randomly stabbed to death in front of his girlfriend &ndash; who desperately tried to get help in the aftermath of the harrowing attack in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Carson, 32, and his girlfriend can be seen sitting on a bus stop bench in Bedford-Stuyvesant and speaking with his girlfriend as the two made their way home from a wedding on Long Island just before 4 a.m. on Monday, according to the surveillance footage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a gray suit, Carson and the young woman, dressed in a blue, sleeveless gown, get up and begin to walk down the block, in the same direction as a man in a dark colored sweatshirt who had just strolled past the pair at the B38 bus stop, with his hood up over his head and his hands in his pockets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just feet ahead of them, the stranger begins kicking scooters parked near the curb for no apparent reason, the footage &ndash; obtained by The Post on Tuesday &ndash; shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, the unhinged man turns to Carson</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The community activist &ndash; who replied that he wasn&rsquo;t looking at anything &ndash; then stepped between his girlfriend and the irate stranger, who began to advance on the couple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; the maniac threatens as Carson pleads with him to &ldquo;Chill! Chill!&rdquo; and holds up his hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the attacker pursues Carson, pulling a knife, as the victim&rsquo;s girlfriend &ndash; running up behind them &ndash; is heard frantically yelling &ldquo;Please, please, please!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he runs, Carson tumbles over the bench the couple had earlier been sitting on. The assailant then grabs his jacket and knocks him onto the ground, savagely stabbing him multiple times in the chest as the victim&rsquo;s girlfriend catches up to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then walks away as Carson lies curled up on the ground, before returning and approaching the terrified woman, who raises her hand to stop him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sicko spits on her &ndash; while still clutching the knife &ndash; before kicking Carson&rsquo;s mortally wounded body and storming away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unknown woman then appears near the corner of the frame, yelling, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him!&rdquo; at the crazed man and repeating what sounds like the name &ldquo;Brian&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bryan.&rdquo; Investigators believe that woman and the suspect knew each other prior to the slaying, police sources said Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; the same woman exclaims as she approaches Carson, still lying on the sidewalk, as his worried girlfriend stands at his side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video cuts off as the girlfriend kneels over her loved one&rsquo;s body, gently moving his arm that had been hanging over his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She held her gravely injured boyfriend in her arms before he was rushed to Kings County Hospital Center, but it was too late &ndash; as the stab wound had pierced his heart, according to cops and sources.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The horrific attack happened at Lafayette Avenue and Malcolm X Boulevard, just blocks from the Bedford-Nostrand avenues train station, where the couple had gotten off the subway on their way home from the wedding, cops said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No arrests had been made in the heinous crime by Tuesday afternoon, but a &ldquo;Wanted&rdquo; poster circulated showing a close-up of the suspect wearing a black &ldquo;Champion&rdquo; sweatshirt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men, this is a somber reminder it&rsquo;s always a good idea to carry a firearm to protect yourself and those you love.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally&hellip;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chicago Airport Now Sheltering Hundreds Of Illegal Migrants As City Waits On Tents</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago is now sheltering hundreds of illegal migrants at O&rsquo;Hare International Airport as the city waits for new shelters to be built.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hundreds of recent arrivals, including babies and the elderly, live in a shuttle bus center at the airport&rsquo;s Terminal 1, where they sleep on cardboard and use airport bathrooms, the Associated Press reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 500 migrants have lived at O&rsquo;Hare at the same time in the crowded area where privacy is a curtain closed with staples, although the migrants have spread out beyond the curtain, some sleeping along windows as travelers walk by.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical care is limited, and germs reportedly spread quickly in the living area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A private firm watches the migrants and their activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The haphazard shelter situation has raised concerns about public health as well as safety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It was supposed to be a stop-and-go place,&rdquo; said Vianney Marzullo, one of the few volunteers at O&rsquo;Hare. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very concerning. It is not just a safety matter, but a public health matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some migrants are also living at Chicago&rsquo;s other airport, Midway International Airport, about 20 miles south of O&rsquo;Hare. Others are sleeping on the floors of police stations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago has been scrambling to respond to a migrant crisis before the cold winter months arrive. The country&rsquo;s third-largest city has experienced an influx of about 14,000 migrants recently, many from Venezuela, and has already spent at least $250 million on the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the city of Chicago signed a $29.4 million contract with a private security firm to build massive winterized camps for newly arrived illegal migrants. The firm will be responsible for building, staffing, and operating the huge tents, which must be able to house between 250 and 1,400 migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson faced pushback last month when he asked all 50 city council members to find two acres in their wards for a large tent that could house 200 migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked in my ward. I just don&rsquo;t have any available space. I have one of the most dense wards in the city,&rdquo; Alderman Brian Hopkins, whose ward includes parts of downtown, said last month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Chicago leaders have been begging the federal government for help with the migrant crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Let me state this clearly: the city of Chicago cannot go on welcoming new arrivals safely and capably without significant support and immigration policy changes,&rdquo; Johnson said in late August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government has already given Chicago and Illinois at least $8.5 million for the migrant crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other major cities are battling a migrant problem as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City is struggling to process about 113,000 migrants who have streamed into the city since last summer. New York also set up tent shelters for migrants last year but ran into issues, including flooding in one of those shelters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other cities like Boston and Atlantic City, New Jersey, have rejected the idea of sheltering migrants in airports.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-prohibiting-official-travel-fossil-fuel-conferences-internal-memo-shows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-prohibiting-official-travel-fossil-fuel-conferences-internal-memo-shows</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>White House prohibiting official travel to fossil fuel conferences, internal memo shows</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House is prohibiting senior administration officials from traveling for international energy engagements that promote carbon-intensive fuels, including oil, natural gas and coal, Fox News Digital has learned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance &mdash; which originated from the White House National Security Council (NSC) &mdash; was revealed in a Department of Energy (DOE) memo issued internally to agency staff on Sept. 15 and obtained by Fox News Digital. The memo was authored by Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk who outlined travel restrictions and stated officials are required to obtain approval from the NSC before attending any global energy engagement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This guidance sets out a presumption that agencies and departments will pursue international energy engagement that advances clean energy projects," Turk wrote in the memo. "It also outlines a process for seeking limited exceptions to pursue carbon-intensive engagements on a justified geostrategic imperative or energy-for-development/energy access basis."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The guidance rules out any U.S. Government &lsquo;engagement related to unabated or partially abated coal generation,&rsquo;" he continued. "Carbon-intensive international energy engagements are those 'directly related and dedicated to the production, transportation, or consumption of carbon-intensive fuels that would lead to additional greenhouse gas emissions.'"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the memo, carbon-intensive fossil fuels include coal, oil and natural gas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the memo notes that the guidance became effective in November 2021 and applies to all international energy engagements. Turk issued a separate memo in early April 2022, which first outlined how the DOE would implement the NSC guidance and stated that energy engagements that promote carbon-intensive fuels may only be exempt if they advance national security or are essential to support energy access in vulnerable areas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turk's September memo updated that guidance, stating that for all future engagements, "Departments and Agencies are required to submit exemption justifications to the NSC and receive NSC concurrence before proceeding with a covered engagement."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOE referred Fox News Digital to the NSC, which didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since taking office, President Biden has pursued an aggressive climate agenda, seeking to boost green energy technologies like solar and wind while curbing domestic reliance on fossil fuels like those listed by the administration as "carbon intensive." Biden has issued federal goals to ensure 50% of U.S. car purchases are zero-emissions by 2030 and that the power sector is carbon-free by 2035.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, vehicles with internal combustion engines (gasoline-powered), make up more than 99% of all cars in the U.S. and about 99% of new car sales, according to J.D. Power. And approximately 60% of electricity in the U.S. is generated from fossil fuels, mainly natural gas, while 17% is produced form wind or solar power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of his agenda, Biden and senior administration officials have traveled to global energy conference to boost green energy development.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And officials have largely been absent from global fossil fuel summits like the World Gas Conference, which former Energy Secretary Rick Perry attended during the Trump administration. The Biden administration also opted against inviting oil and gas industry representatives to the White House Methane Summit in July.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/judge-orders-new-york-dole-out-nearly-half-million-legal-fees-nra-supreme-court-victory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/judge-orders-new-york-dole-out-nearly-half-million-legal-fees-nra-supreme-court-victory</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Judge orders New York to dole out nearly half a million in legal fees to NRA after Supreme Court victory</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A New York judge ordered the state to pay nearly half a million dollars in legal feels to the National Rifle Association (NRA) after the gun rights group won a major case at the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case decided last summer, the Supreme Court ruled that a New York public carry licensing law was unconstitutional and that the ability to carry a pistol in public was a constitutional right guaranteed by the Second Amendment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA was a party in that case, New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen, and last week a New York judge ordered the state to pay $447,700.82 in legal fees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The NRA regards the $447K award in the NYSRPA V. Bruen case as a pivotal victory, a symbol that justice is definitively on our side," Michael Jean, NRA&rsquo;s director of the Office of Litigation Counsel, told Fox News Digital in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This triumph in Bruen has fortified the Second Amendment in an unprecedented manner, and we continue our unrelenting fight to uphold our rights and challenge those who endeavor to infringe upon them," he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean noted, however, that the payout "only scratches the surface" and covers "merely a third" of the group's legal expenses. Jean thanked the generosity of "devoted NRA members" that helped to cover the brunt of the legal fees for the case, noting that "New York refuses to fully compensate."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the high court weighed in, the standard for carrying a weapon required an applicant to show "proper cause" for seeking a license, and allowed New York officials to exercise discretion in determining whether a person has shown a good enough reason for needing to carry a firearm. Stating that one wished to protect themselves or their property was not enough.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In this case, petitioners and respondents agree that ordinary, law-abiding citizens have a similar right to carry handguns publicly for their self-defense. We too agree, and now hold, consistent with Heller and McDonald, that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual&rsquo;s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home," Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the court's opinion, referencing two previous gun cases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Because the State of New York issues public-carry licenses only when an applicant demonstrates a special need for self-defense, we conclude that the State&rsquo;s licensing regime violates the Constitution."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas noted that the state statute does not define what "proper cause" means, and that courts had ruled that the standard was met by people who showed a "special need for self-protection."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the court's decision New York legislators immediately passed the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, which prohibits carrying a gun in "sensitive areas," such as stadiums, houses of worship, museums, parks and other public places; imposes revised record-keeping and new safety requirements on retailers; and mandates background checks on all ammunition purchases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun retailers immediately appealed to the Supreme Court in January to stop that law from going into effect while the litigation proceeds, but the high court rejected their bid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are challenging the ability of the state of New York to target dealers in firearms in the lawful stream of commerce, to put them out of business, which is what the new laws will do," Paloma Capanna, the lead attorney for the New York gun retailers, said. "So it really was unfortunate to see that we couldn't get any emergency temporary injunction against those laws."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://bongino.com/former-kamala-harris-adviser-who-doesnt-appear-to-live-in-california-picked-to-fill-late-dianne-feinsteins-seat"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://bongino.com/former-kamala-harris-adviser-who-doesnt-appear-to-live-in-california-picked-to-fill-late-dianne-feinsteins-seat</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Former Kamala Harris Adviser Who Doesn&rsquo;t Appear to Live in California Picked to Fill Late Dianne Feinstein&rsquo;s Seat</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So eager were Democrats to find a replacement for the late Dianne Feinstein&rsquo;s Senate seat that they apparently didn&rsquo;t even bother to pick someone living in California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Washington Examiner:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appointment of Laphonza Butler to become California's newest senator is already raising some eyebrows as she appears to be registered to vote in Maryland with an address in that state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration records indicate that Butler lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, with her mailing address the same as her residential. She registered as a Democrat as of Sept. 12, 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butler is the president of EMILYs List, the self-described "nation's largest resource dedicated to electing Democratic pro-choice women to office," and a longtime leader in California before her move to Maryland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday night, the newest California senator's biography on the EMILYs List website listed that "Laphonza grew up in Magnolia, MS, and attended one of the country's premier HBCUs, Jackson State University. She lives in Maryland with her partner Neneki Lee and their daughter Nylah."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 7 a.m. Monday, the organization has removed the line that she lives in Maryland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butler was formally Kamala Harris' 2020 campaign adviser.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As radio host Dan O&rsquo;Donnell noticed in real-time, Butler removed part of her biography on her Twitter account that listed Maryland as her location.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, The Spectator&rsquo;s Matt Foldi found that Butler&rsquo;s LinkedIn page also listed her location as Maryland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, merely hours after Foldi&rsquo;s post, Butler&rsquo;s location according to LinkedIn changed to the &ldquo;Los Angeles Metropolitan Area.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we wrap up today&hellip; how about a little on this day in history? It&rsquo;s been awhile!</span></p>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Cluster B is a recognized set of psychological disorders. In this episode, the Pugsters discuss an article by Christopher Rufo that argues that our culture, government, and educational system has promoted these as virtues, with the result that society is being driven by Cluster B personalities. Along with looking at the problem, the guys discuss ideas about what to do about it.</p>

Faithful politics must begin to deal with this forgotten cosmological reality.</p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Thursday, September 28th, , 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Classical Conversations</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classical Conversations supports homeschooling parents by cultivating the love of learning through a Christian worldview in fellowship with other families. They provide a classical Christ-centered curriculum, local like-minded communities across the United States and in several countries, and they train parents who are striving to be great classical&nbsp; educators in the home.

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/brazil-amazon-environment-drought/2023/09/26/id/1135958/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/brazil-amazon-environment-drought/2023/09/26/id/1135958/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Faces a Severe Drought That May Affect around 500,000 People</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Amazon rainforest in Brazil is facing a severe drought that may affect around 500,000 people by the end of the year, authorities said Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Many are already struggling to access essential supplies such as food and water, because the principal means of transportation in the region is waterways, and river levels are historically low. Droughts also impact fishing, a means of subsistence for many riverside communities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Amazonas state declared an environmental emergency two weeks ago in response to the prolonged drought and launched a response plan valued at $20 million. Authorities will also distribute food and water supplies as well as personal hygiene kits, the state&rsquo;s civil defense agency said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Gov. Wilson Lima was in Brazil&rsquo;s capital, Brasilia, on Tuesday to meet with representatives of the federal government. Lima spoke with President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva to discuss the drought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The different levels of government will &ldquo;coordinate measures in support of the people living in the affected municipalities,&rdquo; Lima said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fifteen municipalities were in a state of emergency on Tuesday, while 40 others were on a state of alert, the civil defense authority said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to the port of Manaus, which monitors water levels, the river stood at 16.7 meters (55 feet) on Tuesday, around six meters (20 feet) below the same day last year. The lowest level of water was recorded on Oct. 24, 2010, when the river dropped to 13.6 meters (about 45 feet).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The drought is forecast to last longer and be more intense because of El Ni&ntilde;o climate phenomenon, which inhibits the formation of rain clouds, the civil defense authority said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-approves-bill-striking-down-bidens-crackdown-hunting-archery-overwhelmingly-bipartisan-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-approves-bill-striking-down-bidens-crackdown-hunting-archery-overwhelmingly-bipartisan-vote</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>House approves bill striking down Biden's crackdown on hunting and archery in overwhelmingly bipartisan vote</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The House voted late Tuesday evening in favor of legislation striking down the Biden administration's decision to block federal funding for school shooting sports courses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a 424-1 vote, the House approved the Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act with 216 Republicans and 208 Democrats voting in favor, and just one lawmaker, Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, voting against. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., introduced the bill on Aug. 1, days after a Fox News Digital report in late July revealed the Department of Education was withholding funds for school hunting and archery courses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Hunters and fishers are the best conservationists," Green told Fox News Digital after the vote Tuesday. "Hunting, whether it be with a firearm or bow, is one of the most effective ways to control wildlife populations, protect our beautiful lands, and connect with nature. My Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act is critical for our children."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He added in a separate statement that American students should be encouraged to "participate in enriching athletic activities that foster an appreciation for nature and the ability to focus on a goal." According to Green, in his state alone, the Biden administration's funding decision impacts an estimated 50,000 students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox News Digital reported in July that the Education Department shared federal guidance to hunting education groups highlighting that hunting and archery programs in schools would be stripped of funding. The guidance explained that the administration interpreted the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) to mean such programs can no longer receive taxpayer funds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In the guidance, obtained first by Fox News Digital, senior agency official Sarah Martinez wrote that archery, hunter education and wilderness safety courses use weapons that are "technically dangerous weapons" and therefore "may not be funded under" the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which is the primary source of federal aid for elementary and secondary education across the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to advocates, many schools that offer such courses have already nixed them from curriculums due to the federal guidance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The Department of Education and Secretary Cardona are blatantly misconstruing the law to withhold funding from schools that choose to teach beneficial courses like hunter safety and archery," Lawrence Keane, the National Shooting Sports Foundation's senior vice president, told Fox News Digital in July.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Congress must hold Secretary Cardona and the department accountable for violating the letter and spirit of the law to unilaterally deny America&rsquo;s students access to these valuable programs as part of the Administration&rsquo;s continued attacks on the Second Amendment," Keane added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tommy Floyd, the president of the National Archery in the Schools Program, said his organization boasts roughly 1.3 million students from nearly 9,000 schools across 49 states who are enrolled in archery courses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, the Department of Education has doubled down on its interpretation of the BSCA, saying it would only reverse course if legislation was passed explicitly revising the 2022 law to allow funding for shooting sport programs in schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The law included an amendment to a subsection in the ESEA listing that prohibited uses for federal school funding. That amendment prohibits ESEA funds from helping provide any person with a dangerous weapon or to provide "training in the use of a dangerous weapon," but, according to the BSCA's sponsors, was included to prevent ESEA funding for school resource officer training.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-swarmed-alleged-juvenile-looters-targeting-apple-store-lululemon-footlocker-others"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-swarmed-alleged-juvenile-looters-targeting-apple-store-lululemon-footlocker-others</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Philadelphia swarmed by alleged juvenile looters targeting the Apple Store, Lululemon, Footlocker and others</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Philadelphia police responded to popular retailers like the Apple Store, Lululemon and Footlocker after they were allegedly being ravaged by swarms of looters taking over the City of Brotherly Love Tuesday evening.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At about 8 p.m. Tuesday, police responded to reports of large crowds of juveniles allegedly looting stores in the Center City business corridor of the 9th District.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"In a proactive measure, officers from the 9th District stopped a group of males dressed in black attire and wearing masks at the intersection of 17th and Chestnut Streets," a police spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As of midnight on Wednesday, police confirmed between 15 and 20 people were arrested during the looting and at least two firearms were recovered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As officers were speaking with these individuals, they began to receive reports of looting at the Foot Locker on Chestnut Street.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Responding officers arrived at the Foot Locker and discovered the store had been ransacked in a "coordinated attack," according to the statement. A number of juveniles then fled the scene and at least one adult was arrested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Subsequent incidents of looting were reported in quick succession.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Officers responded to a report of looting at the Lululemon on Walnut Street, where multiple individuals were apprehended.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A short time later, looting was reported at the Apple Store on Walnut Street. No arrests were made in connection with this incident. Phones and tablets were taken from the store, but several stolen items have since been recovered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Videos posted to X, showed retail stores like Lululemon, the Apple Store and Footlocker ravaged by crowds of looters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">FOX 29's Steve Keeley obtained video of a ransacked Apple Store with iPhones and iPads scattered across the display tables. Keeley wrote on X that many of the stolen Apple products were left behind due to the device's comprehensive anti-theft technology.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A police officer told local outlet WCAU-TV that more than 100 juveniles took items from the Lululemon store. No injuries were immediately reported, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police also responded to several other reports of property damage and thefts throughout the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"The Philadelphia Police Department is committed to maintaining public safety and order," police said in the statement Wednesday morning. "We are actively investigating these incidents and working diligently to identify and apprehend those responsible for these unlawful acts. We appreciate the cooperation of our community and urge anyone with information related to these incidents to come forward and assist with the ongoing investigations."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The statement continued: "We would like to thank our dedicated officers who swiftly responded to these incidents, as well as our community members who continue to support law enforcement efforts to keep Philadelphia safe."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The looting came following a Philadelphia judge dismissed charges against former police officer Mark Dial in the shooting death of 27-year-old Eddie Irizarry. Interim Commissioner John Stanford said in a press conference that the thieves were not part of the peaceful protest against the judge's decision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"This had nothing to do with the protests," Stanford said. "What we had tonight was a bunch of criminal opportunists take advantage of a situation to make an attempt to destroy our city."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The news comes as Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw resigned in the beginning of September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Crime data from the Philadelphia Police Department shows there has been a 21% drop in homicides this year to date compared to the same day in 2021, when the city recorded 562 homicides throughout the year. But prior to Outlaw leading the department, the data shows Philadelphia annually recorded between 246 to 391 homicides each year between 2007 and 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In 2020, when she took over, there were 499 homicides, followed by 562 in 2021 and 516 in 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Meanwhile in California&hellip;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In August, a Nordstrom store was ransacked by a "flash mob" of more than 30 people in a large smash-and-grab. The thieves made out with nearly $100,000 worth of designer handbags and clothes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Similarly to Philadelphia, video captured shows a group of 30 to 50 people wearing sweatshirts with hoods over their heads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The suspects are seen inside the department store as they rush to the front entrance with bags in hand, scooping up whatever merchandise they can while tripping on racks to which some items were still attached.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Police estimate the stolen merchandise to be worth between $60,000 and $100,000.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Wuhan Institute of Virology Warns the World: Prepare for Another COVID-19 Pandemic</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As many as 20 coronavirus species are likely to cause a new outbreak, according to a study from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), a stark warning to prepare for another COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a study in Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections in July, the WIV has been making headlines, as many social media users have begun coming to their own conclusions online.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Wuhan scientists documented their study of 40 coronavirus species, identifying 20 as &ldquo;high risk &hellip; including 6 of which jumped to human, 3 with evidence of spillover but not to human and 11 without evidence of spillover yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;It is almost certain that there will be future disease emergence, and it is highly likely a CoV [coronavirus] disease again,&rdquo; the study said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Thus, the early preparation for the animal CoVs with risk of spillover is important for future disease preparedness, regarding the likely animal origin of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is a disease that caused a deadly outbreak in China over 20 years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) is a coronavirus disease first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The study&rsquo;s auhtors included Shi Zhengli, a Chinese coronavirus expert known as &ldquo;batwoman&rdquo; for her academic studies on the coronavirus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">She became a figure of international focus during the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Shi stopped public appearances in early 2020 but reemerged to defend the Chinese government from claims that the coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bankruptcy Filings Spiked In 2023 Under The Biden Administration, And You Should Expect More Financial Chaos To Come</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data released Tuesday showed that Americans filed more than 39,000 bankruptcy cases in Aug. 2023, an 18 percent increase from the same time last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data released by Unusual Whales details how, along with personal bankruptcy filings, there were more than 41,600 new bankruptcy cases recorded in August, including for businesses. This marks the thirteenth consecutive month that bankruptcy filings have shown a year-over-year increase under the Biden administration&rsquo;s embarrassing and dangerous economic policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bankruptcy filings are not a surprise to anyone with a finger on the pulse of the domestic and global economy, but likely come as a shock to those just trying to keep afloat. As so many families were lulled into a false sense of financial security during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, their ill-advised spending habits have landed them in hot water.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many folks bought homes they couldn&rsquo;t afford in the last two years, often with minimal down payments, bad credit and sky-high mortgage rates. Some of these individuals were banking on a pause or total relief of their student loan debt to keep the lights on, but this hasn&rsquo;t really materialized like people thought it would (duh).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most terrifying thing is that a lot of folks set-up interest-only payments for property purchases for the first five years or so of their mortgage. This means lower payments today, but zero equity build-up in homes these individuals won&rsquo;t be able to afford once they&rsquo;re forced to pay the equity and interest &mdash; which will almost definitely lead to more bankruptcies, foreclosures and worse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/25/mayors-fault-blue-city-average-40-vehicle-thefts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/25/mayors-fault-blue-city-average-40-vehicle-thefts/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;The Mayor&rsquo;s Fault&rsquo;: Blue City Reports An Average Of 40 Vehicle Thefts A Day</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers in Oakland, California, have reported more than 10,000 motor vehicle thefts in the city since the start of 2023, data from the Oakland Police Department (OPD) shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OPD recorded a total of 10,547 motor vehicle thefts &mdash; an average of 40 vehicle thefts a day &mdash; and a 51% increase from the year-to-date reported number of thefts in 2022, CBS News Bay Area reported. At least 133 vehicles were stolen between Sept. 11 and Sept. 17, and an additional 12 vehicles were carjacked during the same time period, according to the OPD data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I&rsquo;m no math wiz - but that&rsquo;s a lot of thefts!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland residents have placed pressure on their district attorney and mayor for months to increase the town&rsquo;s police force and security response as crime in the city has continued to escalate. Residents became even more frustrated with local officials over the past week after the city failed to submit an application to the California government to receive additional crime-fighting funds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The buck stops with the mayor. This is the mayor&rsquo;s fault. It stops with the mayor. We need to hear from the mayor,&rdquo; Oakland NAACP President Cynthia Adams told CBS on Sept. 18.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers admitted that the number of overall crimes in the area is likely much higher because many residents have stopped reporting crimes to the police, according to CBS. Total crime in Oakland has gone up 27% since 2022 while violent crime has increased by 20%, OPD data shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Oakland mayor&rsquo;s office and the OPD did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation&rsquo;s request for comment.</span></p>

<p><strong>Desire for large families hits 50-year high in America: Gallup</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of people in America prefer families of three or more children, hitting the highest desire for large families since 1971.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Gallup survey released Monday, the number of people who prefer smaller and larger family sizes are statistically tied, bouncing back from a decadeslong trend of believing one or two children was ideal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Overall, this recent survey shows that Americans might finally be climbing out of the anti-family bomb shelter caused by the myths of the 1960&rsquo;s of a population explosion disaster," Terry Schilling, the president of the American Principles Project, told the Washington Examiner. "Favoring more children is a sign that Americans are returning to basic principles and values that life was made for &mdash; bringing forth the next generation through the family."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-five percent now favor larger families, with 29% finding three children as ideal, 12% who prefer four, and 2% each who prefer five, six, or more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is compared to 47% who believe two or fewer children is ideal, with 44% preferring two children and 3% preferring one. Two percent believe the ideal family should not include children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup pointed to several social trends from past decades that may have contributed to the decline in having children, including the preference for larger families "plummeting" from 70% in 1967 to 52% in 1972 "fueled at least in part by concerns about a global population explosion, resulting from the 1968 bestselling book entitled The Population Bomb."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization started tracking this data in 1936, when 64% preferred three children, reaching a peak in 1945 at 77%. However, by 1973, the strong preference for families of one or two children became the norm, evidenced by the 50% drop in children-per-family from the peak of the baby boom to 1.8 children in 1980.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What stands out to Schilling, however, is that only 8% do not wish to have children, leaving over 90% with the desire for children at any amount.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The 8% of America that&rsquo;s anti-family has way too much representation in our culture &mdash; especially in entertainment, politics, news media, academia, and even corporations," Schilling said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup notes that people under the age of 30 are at least twice as likely to say they do not want children, but the "vast majority" continue to prefer having children. Twenty-one percent of that age group already has children, and 63% hope to have children in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, 69% of those who already have children want more, as well as 15% of 18- to 40-year-olds who want to be parents someday. Six percent of childless people aged 41 and older also wished they had children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While ideal family size is not significantly different from men to women, other demographic traits do trend in certain directions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young people aged 18-29 are more likely than any other age group to prefer larger family sizes, and black and Hispanic people are also more likely to prefer larger families. In addition, Republicans, conservative independents, and lower-income residents tend to prefer families with more children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, Democrats, non-religious, and wealthy residents are more likely to prefer only one or two children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite stated preferences, birth rates have been on the decline, and adults are starting families much later in life, which is highly correlated to smaller family sizes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the average age of a woman who had her first child was 27.3 years, a record high.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the answer for fertility declines, author Melanie Notkin writes in a piece for the Institute for Family Studies, is that much like the effect of The Population Bomb in the 1960s and 1970s, "we have a similar trend with the rise of anti-natalism where its nihilistic supporters believe the world is too sad a place to bring children into, along with climate change 'doomerism.' More practically, the current economy makes family forming more challenging for many young Americans."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the public has appeared to cut through some of the popular trends, Schilling told the Washington Examiner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There are so many policies across the cultural and economic spectrum that make family formation much more difficult, and it&rsquo;s a true testament to the beauty and intrinsic value of the family that in spite of all the hurdles before us, we still desire children and family," he said.</span></p>

<p><strong>US Offers Poland Rare Loan of $2 Billion to Modernize Its Military</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My goodness - we&rsquo;re giving out loans everywhere! You get a loan, you get a loan, and you Hawaiins get $700&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration announced Monday that it is offering a $2 billion loan to Poland, which has been a hub for weapons going into Ukraine, to support the ally's defense modernization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Department said in a statement that Poland is a &ldquo;stalwart&rdquo; ally of the U.S. whose &ldquo;security is vital to the collective defense&rdquo; of NATO &rsquo;s eastern flank, and that such funding is reserved for Washington&rsquo;s most important security partners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. government is also providing Warsaw up to $60 million for the cost of the loan in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) which would support &ldquo;urgent procurements of defense articles and services from the United States,&rdquo; the State Department said. The $60 million is a loan subsidy meant to ensure that Warsaw can secure favorable terms for the loan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since Russia&rsquo;s full-scale invasion of the country, handing over large numbers of its own tanks, fighter jets and other equipment. It has also been a hub for most of the Western weapons going to Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been undergoing a process of modernization to replace what it gave away, much of which was based on old Soviet technology, putting in orders with U.S. and South Korean defense companies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently the Polish-Ukrainian relationship has seen strains due to a trade dispute centered on Ukrainian grain entering the Polish market and driving down the prices Polish farmers can get. Amid the spat Poland&rsquo;s Prime Minister said his country was no longer sending any more weapons to Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comment created some confusion. Analysts noted that Poland has already in fact given Ukraine most of what it has to give, and the statement was made ahead of a Polish election and did not mean much. But it also raised concerns that Western support for Ukraine could be weakening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. officials have sought to play down the spat, praising Poland&rsquo;s role in helping Ukraine and noting that it is in Poland&rsquo;s strategic interest for Ukraine to prevail against Russia.</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Liberty Dispatch</strong> ~ September 26, 2023<br />WHO ARE THE REAL FASCISTS? In this episode, hosts Andrew and Matthew compare the MSM coverage of the <em>1 Million March 4 Children&nbsp;</em>to reality. No surprise the media lies and obfuscates. Sadly, Canada's Conservative Party proves they are indeed cons. Finally, all 338 MPs serenade a nazi soldier with raucous applause during Volodymyr Zelensky's fundraising trip to parliament, an applause only dwarfed by the profanation of God's Law in passing Bill C-4.

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-admin-moves-to-give-federal-ids-to-illegal-immigrants?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-admin-moves-to-give-federal-ids-to-illegal-immigrants?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden admin moves to give federal IDs to illegal immigrants</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration is moving forward with its plan to provide identification cards to illegal immigrants via Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency announced the ICE Secure Docket Card program in 2022, however new details recently emerged revealing how the cards will look.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In appearance, they looks like drivers licenses or non-driver IDs. ICE has stressed, however, that they "will not be an official form of federal identification," simply acting as a more modern alternative to the paper documents issued to those who make the crossing into the United States. Many Democrat-run cities have also offered ID cards to illegal immigrants, and some cities have even tried to push through the ability for illegal immigrants to vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Images obtained by Fox News show that the cards will be clearly marked with ICE logos, and include all the relevant information about the holder. In the top right corner there will be a QR code, which officials can scan to gain access to a case file. The cards will also include bigraphic data, and be fitted with "cutting edge" security features.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The ICE secure docket card concept is a pilot program that would modernize documentation provided to some noncitizens," an ICE spokesperson told the outlet. "While the specifics of the program are under development, it is important to note the secure card will not be an official form of federal identification. The secure card will indicate it is for use by DHS agencies and would be provided only after national security background checks have been performed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE claimed that "moving to a secure card will save the agency millions, free up resources, and ensure information is quickly accessible to DHS officials while reducing the agency&rsquo;s FOIA backlog."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Paper documents," the spokesperson added, "pose a security risk, are easily lost, and degrade rapidly in real-world use, creating inefficiencies for the government and noncitizens."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone is thrilled at the prospect of issuing ID cards to those who entered the country illegally. When the plan was introduced last year, for example, members of the House Oversight Committee said it was "yet another Biden Administration move encouraging illegal immigration by rewarding illegal immigrants for breaking our laws."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/far-left-group-takes-credit-for-demonetizing-russell-brand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/far-left-group-takes-credit-for-demonetizing-russell-brand/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Far-Left Group Takes Credit for Demonetizing Russell Brand</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after major advertisers, including Burger King and HelloFresh, pulled the plug on Rumble following the sexual assault against comedian Russell Brand, a far-left group took credit for the ad rug pull.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported last week, the brands pulled their adverts from the platform, where Brand has amassed a following of 1.4m.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News Movement reported that Burger King paused advertising with the platform, while Asos said it had manually removed its ads from Rumble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, video-sharing giant YouTube also demonetized Russell Brand&rsquo;s videos on his channel following sexual assault allegations against the comedian.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have suspended monetization on Russell Brand&rsquo;s channel for violating our creator responsibility policy,&rdquo; the platform announced Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand is accused of rape, sexual abuse, and emotional abuse from 2006 to 2013, according to The Times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the comedian has not been charged with any crimes or found guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand has now become a left&rsquo;s enemy, and he is about to witness for himself the lengths they will go to in order to destroy someone&rsquo;s life if they don&rsquo;t toe the line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, far-left radicals Nandini Jammi and her business partner Claire Atkin took the credit for Rumble&rsquo;s advertisers dropping Brand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jammi is a co-founder of far-left company Sleeping Giants, makes her money by attacking any companies that advertise on conservative platforms, like what has happened with Russell Brand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of large companies have pulled their advertisements from the video platform Rumble, where Russell Brand broadcasts his weekly show, in the week since allegations of rape and sexual assault against the comedian came to light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The News Movement reported on Friday that Burger King, Asos, the Barbican, and HelloFresh, the recipe box delivery service, had removed their ads. The Brand has 1.4m followers on the platform. YouTube suspended Brand&rsquo;s ability to earn money on its platform on Tuesday, but Rumble has rejected calls to do the same. On Friday, Brand said the moves to block him from receiving advertising revenue for his videos on social media platforms have occurred &ldquo;in the context of the online safety bill.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Rumble accused a parliamentary committee of &ldquo;deeply inappropriate&rdquo; behavior after Caroline Dinenage, the Conservative chair of the culture, media, and sport committee, wrote a letter to the company&rsquo;s chief executive, Chris Pavlovski, to express concern that Brand &ldquo;may be able to profit from his content on the platform.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the UK parliament asked Rumble why they have not demonetized the comedian&rsquo;s channel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1704092016764670139"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1704092016764670139</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British Member of Parliament, Dame Caroline Dinenage, wrote to Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski asking whether he would suspend monetization of Brand&rsquo;s account, noting that Brand had posted his pre-emptive message regarding the allegations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Striking writers whose industrial action has paralyzed Hollywood said Sunday they had reached an &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; deal with studios that could see them go back to work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apparent breakthrough will raise hopes that striking actors can also reach terms with studios to end a months-long impasse that has seen film and TV production largely halted, costing the California economy billions of dollars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have reached a tentative agreement on a new 2023 (minimum basic agreement), which is to say an agreement in principle on all deal points, subject to drafting final contract language,&rdquo; said a letter the Writers Guild of America sent to members.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We can say, with great pride, that this deal is exceptional &mdash; with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter, which AFP has seen, gave no details. It said language was being ironed out and that the final say on whether to accept what was on offer rested with the membership.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;To be clear, no one is to return to work until specifically authorized to by the Guild. We are still on strike until then. But we are, as of today, suspending WGA picketing,&rdquo; it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A terse joint statement from the WGA and the AMPTPT, the umbrella group representing studios and streamers confirmed an agreement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of film and television scribes downed their pens in early May over demands including better pay for writers, greater rewards for creating hit shows, and protection from artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have manned picket lines for months outside offices including Netflix and Disney, and were joined by striking actors in mid-July, leaving normally busy Hollywood lots all but vacant, in an ebullient and united show of force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actors&rsquo; union SAG-AFTRA congratulated the WGA, praising the &ldquo;incredible strength, resiliency and solidarity on the picket lines.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;While we look forward to reviewing the WGA and AMPTP&rsquo;s tentative agreement, we remain committed to achieving the necessary terms for our members,&rdquo; it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negotiations between studios and writers had been moribund for weeks until a new sense of urgency appeared to have been injected into the process in the last few days, with the heads of Netflix, Disney, Universal and Warner Bros Discovery personally attending the talks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among their demands, writers say their salaries have not kept up with inflation, and that the rise of streaming has diminished the &ldquo;residuals&rdquo; they earn when a show they work on becomes a smash hit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studios had offered greater transparency in streaming audience numbers, while stopping short of offering to revise the way residual payments are calculated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writers have also demanded curbs on the use of AI, which they fear could be used to partially replace them in generating future films or show scripts, and therefore further undercut their pay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5 billion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Financial Times reported Milken Institute research at the start of September that put the cost of the current Hollywood standstill at $5 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 146 days, the WGA strike is significantly longer than the writers&rsquo; 2007-08 walkout &mdash; which lasted 100 days and cost the California economy $2.1 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the writers deal is finalized, the actors&rsquo; strike would continue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been no known contract talks between the studios and the actors&rsquo; 160,000-strong SAG-AFTRA guild since that strike began.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the two unions share many similar demands, and insiders say that a WGA deal could help to pave the way for a resolution to the actors&rsquo; strike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We remain on strike in our TV/Theatrical contract and continue to urge the studio and streamer CEOs and the AMPTP to return to the table and make the fair deal that our members deserve and demand,&rdquo; SAG-AFTRA said.</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>We're ready for our ratings to SOAR now that we're incorporating some FIGHTING. Jump into the boxing ring with us today, Neighbor!</p>
<p>Send us an email to let us know if you need some more controversy, or if you want us to drum up some more "Brain Candy" for your listening pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>People don't like to think of themselves as antagonistic...&nbsp; &nbsp;But, once they decide that someone else "deserves it," for any reason, then all bets are off.&nbsp; They get to be antagonistic without counting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John was accused of "stirring the pot" this week. That's not a Fruit of the Spirit, you know? Let's not talk about controversial stuff, because that's more Christlike.</p>
<p>But, what if: Controversy is the rich soil from which relationships grow?&nbsp; People don't want poop on their relationships...but they need to trust the fertilizing process!</p>
<p>Later: John shares a meme involving an octopus--(i.e. the 8-legged mammals of the sea)--which helps prove once again that Neurodiversity is a fancy word for "spends too much time on the internet."&nbsp; We really need to stop helping people hyperfocus on what they can't do. It's normal to be bad at things.&nbsp; It's NOT normal to expect the entire school system to cater to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We talk a little bit about ADHD meds...</p>
<p>And, finally:&nbsp; &nbsp; 5-year-old Silas hops on the mic for just a second.&nbsp; And this prompts the Peaches to share two stories from Parenting World.</p>
<p>Contact the Comedian Next Door at <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com/</a></p>
<p>We hope you've enjoyed this dramatic brawl!</p>]]></description>
