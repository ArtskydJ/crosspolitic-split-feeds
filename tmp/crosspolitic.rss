   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Friday, October 27th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start today&rsquo;s show with tragic news coming out of Lewiston Maine, as a gun man shot and killed at least 18 people, and wounded 13 more&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/lewiston-maine-mass-shooting-october-26"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/lewiston-maine-mass-shooting-october-26</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine State Police have released a detailed timeline of the mass shooting in Lewiston that killed at least 18 people and injured 13 more at two separate locations Wednesday night as the manhunt for suspect Robert Card intensified across the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 6:56 p.m., the Auburn Communications Center was alerted that an unidentified man walked into Just-In-Time Bowling, which was recently renamed from Sparetime Recreation, on Mollison Street in Lewiston and began shooting. Police said multiple 911 calls that followed confirmed the shooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 7:08 p.m., the Auburn Communications Center received multiple calls that a man had entered a Bar and Grille Restaurant on Lincoln Street and opened fire.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said multiple law enforcement agencies and emergency medical personnel were immediately dispatched to the locations, which are about 4 miles apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 8:06 pm, police released a photo of the alleged shooter to the media. The surveillance photo showed a man wearing a brown sweatshirt and holding a rifle while walking through doors decorated with bowling pins and a bowling ball.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 9:26 p.m., the Lewiston Police Department received a call identifying the man in the distributed photos as Robert Card, 40, of Bowdoin, Maine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 9:56 p.m., the Lisbon Police Department notified Lewiston Police that it had located a white Subaru at the at a Boat Launch in Lisbon. The vehicle was confirmed to belong to Card.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card remains at large as more than 350 law enforcement personnel from federal, state and local agencies continue to search for him. Authorities stress that Card should be considered armed and dangerous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card is a "trained firearms instructor" who recently reported mental health issues,including "hearing voices and threats to shoot up the National Guard Base in Saco, ME," according to a Maine law enforcement bulletin shared with Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card is also a Petroleum Supply Specialist in the Army Reserve, having enlisted in December 2002, an Army spokesperson told Fox News, adding that Card has had no combat deployments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials have yet to publicly name any of the 18 victims, and police said Thursday morning 10 of the victims killed have yet to be identified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police have confirmed that seven people &mdash; one female and six males &mdash; were killed at the bowling alley, which was holding a youth league at the time of the shooting. Eight males were killed at the Bar and Grille. Three additional people died after first responders rushed them to Central Maine Medical Hospital in Lewiston.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional 13 people were injured in the shootings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 80 FBI agents are involved in the search for Robert Card, in addition to agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Coast Guard, according to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collins made the comments during a press conference on Thursday evening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I had a call from the deputy director of the FBI who told me that there were 80 FBI agents on site participating in the search for the killer," Collins said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local law enforcement agencies are also searching for Card.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we move on, I want to ask that you be praying for the community of Lewiston Maine today&hellip; pray that the Lord would be near the broken hearted as is promised in His word&hellip; that He would bind up their wounds, and grant comfort and peace to those who are grieving the loss of loved ones. Be praying that the Lord would be with local leaders in Maine, both political and law enforcement&hellip; and that justice would be served on the one responsible for this heinous crime, and tragic loss of life.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Johnson begins House speakership with focus on debt, inflation, &lsquo;border catastrophe&rsquo; as top issues</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the newly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives kicked off his leadership role on Wednesday with a commitment to establish a fiscal commission dedicated to rolling back excessive government spending as a way to reduce inflation. He also called on the Senate and White House to stop ignoring the &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; at the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson described the nation&rsquo;s rising $33 trillion national debt as the greatest threat to national security and connected it to the level of inflation that America&rsquo;s families have been grappling with the last few years.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.19fortyfive.com/2023/10/u-s-aircraft-carriers-and-marines-are-on-the-move-towards-irans-military-backyard/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.19fortyfive.com/2023/10/u-s-aircraft-carriers-and-marines-are-on-the-move-towards-irans-military-backyard/</span></a></p>

<p><strong>U.S. Aircraft Carriers And Marines Are On The Move Towards Iran&rsquo;s &lsquo;Military Backyard&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation in Israel continues to be tense as the Israeli Defense Forces are on standby to launch a large-scale ground invasion of Gaza. As of now, Tel Aviv has agreed to hold off invading until the U.S. military puts more forces in the area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Israeli Air Force is pounding hundreds of targets within Gaza, killing and wounding hundreds of Hamas terrorists and Palestinian civilians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other end, Hamas continues to be defiant, launching missiles and small-scale attacks against Israel. The terrorist group also holds scores of hostages and is threatening to execute them if Israel invades.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the German newspaper Bild, the Israelis won&rsquo;t hold back a possible ground invasion of Gaza over the issue of the hostages. Hamas is currently holding over 200 hostages and has been using them as deterrence against an Israeli ground invasion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with more than 1,400 Israelis killed and thousands more wounded, the Israeli government might very likely choose to go in and destroy Hamas despite what might happen to the hostages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Israeli Army is likely waiting for the air force to take out the most important targets before it rolls in with tanks and armored personnel carriers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, two more hostages were released this week as two elderly women, were released on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the women said, &ldquo;When we arrived in Gaza, they first told us that they believed in the Quran and would not harm us, they fed us well, were kind, a doctor and paramedic visited us regularly, everything was provided for us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But their experience leading up to their captivity in Gaza was traumatic. Hostages were beaten and humiliated as they were snatched from their homes in Israel to Gaza&rsquo;s underground tunnel complex.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the international military presence around Israel continues to grow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European countries are getting ready for forceful evacuations of their citizens from Israel and Lebanon. German and French special operations forces have set up camp in Cyprus and are on standby for contingencies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military has already sent two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region and the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), which is special operations capable. The Pentagon has also relocated a number of C-130 tactical transport aircraft and support personnel to Greece to be on standby for potential evacuation operations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far, Israel has been adamant that it doesn&rsquo;t want any direct military assistance or foreign boots on the ground. However, Tel Aviv was allowed a number of U.S. military advisors to support the Israeli Defense Forces. According to Axios, U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. James Glynn, a former commander of the Marine Forces Special Operations Command and with experience against the Islamic State, is leading the advisory group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased presence of U.S. forces in the region is also in response to credible threats about U.S. citizens and facilities in the region.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to U.S. defense officials, the Pentagon assesses that state and non-state actors in the region&mdash;mainly Iran&mdash;are considering escalating the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hamas into a wider regional conflict.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military is ready to counter any hostile actions in the area. Whether Iran understands the danger is another thing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in entertainment news&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/jenna-fischer-angela-kinsey-office-reboot-update/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/jenna-fischer-angela-kinsey-office-reboot-update/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Office&rsquo; Alums Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey: No News on a Reboot (Yet)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Office&rdquo; is one of the most streamed sitcoms around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show, spun from the British version created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, aired on NBC for nine seasons. The workplace comedy nearly got canceled after its first year, but it found its creative footing and became a modern TV classic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show said goodbye in 2013, with cast members like Steve Carell and John Krasinski drawing raves for follow-up projects like &ldquo;Foxcatcher&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Quiet Place,&rdquo; respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Puck News reports show runner Greg Daniels is prepping an &ldquo;Office&rdquo; reboot. That&rsquo;s news to show alums Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, AKA the hosts of the popular &ldquo;Office Ladies&rdquo; podcast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two discussed a possible show return via their podcast, throwing some cold water on the possibility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We get asked all the time, there are always these rumors of another American version [of &lsquo;The Office&rsquo;],&rdquo; Fischer said in the latest episode of &ldquo;Office Ladies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Like a reboot or a remake or a spinoff.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No one has ever in all of these years &hellip; contacted me about being on another version of &lsquo;The Office.&rsquo; Or any cast member,&rdquo; said Fischer, who played receptionist Pam Beesly on the series. &ldquo;Whenever I talk to the cast members., &lsquo;never heard of anything. Not a word.'&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Do we need a 50-year-old Pam sitting at a desk at Dunder Mifflin?&rdquo;&nbsp; referring to turning that age next year. One cast member should definitely be invited back, she suggested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I like the idea that Creed still works there .. he comes down from the ceiling at night,&rdquo; Fischer said of the mercurial character played by ex-rocker Creed Bratton.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Johnson secures speaker's gavel as Republicans rally behind nominee</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Mike Johnson was elected by the House to become the next speaker as Republicans rallied behind their fourth nominee to replace former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson could afford only a handful of defections from his fellow Republicans in the chamber-wide vote, but unlike prior candidates, there were no defections to his candidacy from his party.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He won 220 votes, needing around 217 to become speaker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats meanwhile continued to vote for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He picked up 209 votes from his fellow Democrats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson scored his party's nomination late Tuesday, with several members absent and three voting present. In just the hours from Tuesday, though, Johnson has shored up support from the three Republicans who voted present in Tuesday's late nomination vote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson also got support from President Trump, who gave his support for the GOP nominee, urging Republicans to "get it done, fast" ahead of a potential House speaker vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>DNC says House GOP will 'have to answer' for electing 'MAGA' Mike Johnson as speaker</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic National Committee (DNC) took aim at newly-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Wednesday just before he won a House-wide vote to replace former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., saying Republicans would "have to answer" to voters in 2024 for supporting him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Many Americans are waking up this morning wondering &mdash; who is Mike Johnson? We&rsquo;re here to help: MAGA Republicans&rsquo; new speaker-designate supports extreme nationwide abortion bans," DNC National Press Secretary Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He led the charge for Donald Trump denying President Biden&rsquo;s legitimate election win and tried to overthrow the votes of 81 million Americans. He&rsquo;s a leading proponent of slashing Social Security and Medicare," she said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chitika called Johnson a "carbon-copy" of "MAGA extremism," and predicted House Republicans would have to answer for supporting him when voters head to the polls in 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Make no mistake: The American people will hold them accountable for this choice," she added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Republicans celebrate newly minted House Speaker Mike Johnson's gavel ascension</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans celebrated the election of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., after he ascended to the gavel on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson was elected speaker via a vote of 220-209, taking over the gavel from Speaker pro-tempore Patrick McHenry, R-N.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans were ecstatic about the election of Johnson, with House Majority Whip Tom Emmer &mdash; who secured the GOP's speaker nomination on Tuesday before bowing out &mdash; writing his congratulations to the new speaker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Congratulations to my friend and colleague, [Johnson], on being elected Speaker of the House!" Emmer posted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"His strong convictions and commitment to conservatism will serve this body and the American people well," Emmer added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., who also ran for House speaker, wrote "servant leadership," with a picture of the new speaker's nameplate</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"God bless America," Donalds wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-report-unmasks-true-costs-electric-vehicle-mandates-remain-expensive"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-report-unmasks-true-costs-electric-vehicle-mandates-remain-expensive</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New report unmasks true costs of electric vehicle mandates: 'Remain more expensive'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sweeping first-of-its-kind analysis published by think tank Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) concludes that electric vehicles (EV) would cost tens of thousands of dollars more if not for generous taxpayer-funded incentives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the TPPF report &mdash; authored by energy experts Jason Isaac and Brent Bennett &mdash; the average model year 2021 EV would cost approximately $48,698 more to own over a 10-year period without the staggering $22 billion in taxpayer-funded handouts that the government provides to electric car manufacturers and owners. The analysis factors in federal fuel efficiency programs, electric grid strain, and direct state and federal subsidies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It is not an overstatement to say that the federal government is subsidizing EVs to a greater degree than even wind and solar electricity generation and embarking on an unprecedented endeavor to remake the entire American auto industry," the report states. "Despite these massive incentives, EVs are receiving a tepid response from the majority of Americans who cannot shoulder their higher cost."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s time for federal and state governments to stop driving the American auto industry off an economic cliff and allow markets to drive further improvements in cost and efficiency," it continues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report determined that, thanks to a special multiplier that has existed for more than two decades, EVs receive roughly seven times more credits under federal fuel efficiency programs than they provide in actual fuel economy benefits. That figure, the total regulatory credits from federal and state fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards, amounts to an average of $27,881 per vehicle for EV makers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, the analysis calculated the socialized cost of EV charging stations' strain on the U.S. electric grid amounts to an average of $11,833 per EV over 10 years. Such costs are shouldered by utility ratepayers and taxpayers, many of whom may not own an EV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, finally, state governments and the federal government provide an average of $8,984 per EV over 10 years in direct taxpayer-funded subsidies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The stark reality for proponents of EVs and for the dreamers in the federal government, who are using fuel economy regulations to force manufacturers to produce ever more EVs, is that the true cost of an EV is in no way close to a comparable [internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV)]," the report concludes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Without increased and sustained government favors, EVs will remain more expensive than ICEVs for many years to come," it states. "Hence why, even with these subsidies, EVs have been challenging for dealers to sell and why basic economic realities indicate that the Biden administration&rsquo;s dream of achieving 100% EVs by 2040 will never become a reality."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TPPF report, meanwhile, comes as lawmakers at the federal and state level continue to take aim at traditional gas-powered vehicles while boosting EVs. President Biden has set a goal of ensuring 50% of all car sales are zero-emissions by 2030 and his administration has pursued rigorous restrictions on gas-powered vehicles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized rules, which targeted heavy-duty trucks, that it said at the time were the "strongest-ever national clean air standards to cut smog- and soot-forming emissions" from such vehicles. The new standards went into effect on March 27 and will be implemented for new trucks sold after 2027.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in April, the EPA proposed the most aggressive federal tailpipe emissions rules on light- and medium-duty emissions ever crafted. If finalized and implemented, 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck purchases, 35% of short-haul freight tractor purchases, and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could be electric by 2032, the White House projected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Months later, in July, the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued its most aggressive fuel economy standards ever, an action critics say would increase consumer costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last year, the EPA also reinstated California&rsquo;s authority under the Clean Air Act to implement its own emission standards and electric vehicle sales mandates, allowing other states to also adopt California's rules. The state then approved regulations that mandated all car purchases in the state &mdash; which leads the country in annual car sales &mdash; be electric by 2035.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Scientists Discover 8 New Viruses on Tropical Island - What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese scientists working on tropical Hainan Island off China's southern coast have discovered eight new viruses in that island's rodent population, and have not ruled out the capability of those viruses to species-jump to humans. One of the viruses has been confirmed to have been a coronavirus; the COVID-19 virus was also a coronavirus, as are several of the viruses that can cause the syndrome we call "the common cold," although rhinoviruses are more common in those cases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers tasked with preparing the world for future pandemic took almost 700 samples from rodents living in Hainan, just off China's southern coast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight novel viruses &mdash; including one belonging to the same family as Covid &mdash; were uncovered in the project, funded by the Chinese Government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts said the discovered pathogens had a 'high probability' of infecting humans should they ever cross the species barrier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, they called for further experiments on the viruses to determine exactly what their effects on humans could be.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of people from lots of governments as well as academic institutions and private-sector organizations do these kinds of surveys, of course. That's how we learn about viruses, or about anything else in the natural world &mdash; by going out, taking samples, and examining things. But there's a different wrinkle in this case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings were shared in the journal Virologica Sinica, the publishing arm of the Chinese Society for Microbiology (CSM).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CSM is linked to the state-affiliated China Association of Science and Technology, which 'accepts administrative supervision' from the Chinese Government's 'Ministry of Civil Affairs'.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virologica Sinica is also edited by Dr Shi Zhengli, an influential scientist described as China's 'bat woman' who works inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology &ndash; considered to be the source of the Covid pandemic in some corners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journal's editorial board also features over a dozen other academics linked to the WIV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last sentence of that article's conclusion might raise some concerns:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pathogenicity and associated impact of these novel viruses on humans and animals should be evaluated in further studies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is, yes, the same Wuhan virology lab that set off alarms about their safety practices at the outbreak of the COVID-19 panic. (There, the Wuhan lab isn't alone.) This is also the same Wuhan virology lab where $2 million in U.S. taxpayer funds were used to conduct research, including gain-of-function research.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that doesn't set some alarm bells ringing, it's not at all clear what would.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming as it does, hot on the heels of the impeccably coiffed Governor Newsom flying to the Middle Kingdom to stump for Chinese electric cars, and at a time when the American public is growing good and tired of the whole COVID scare, the timing of the discovery is interesting as well. Granted, these kinds of expeditions go on all the time, and granted as well that China doesn't have an unlimited pool of virologists out there looking for work.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Tom Emmer Wins GOP Nomination For Speaker Of The House On Secret Ballot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Majority Whip Tom Emmer won the nomination for Speaker of the House on Tuesday after five rounds of votes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans were voting by secret ballot until they were able to get to a candidate who received a simple majority of the conference votes. After each round of votes, the member who received the lowest numbers was eliminated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates running had the option to drop out before each round of votes if they felt that they did not have enough support. 109 votes were needed to win.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the first round, there were seven GOP Republicans running for Speaker.

<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/nation/states/center-square/nearly-1-million-residents-left-california-2022-fueled-cost-living"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/nation/states/center-square/nearly-1-million-residents-left-california-2022-fueled-cost-living</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nearly 1 million residents left California in 2022 fueled by cost of living</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exodus from California accelerated in 2022, with 817,000 residents leaving the state in 2022 for an annual net loss of over three hundred thousand residents to other states, according to new U.S. Census data. Should outmigration continue, California could lose more than the five, already projected, congressional seats it&rsquo;s expected to shed after the 2030 census.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the COVID-19 pandemic and switch to remote work, California lost population for the first time in its existence as a state, leading to the loss of a single congressional seat in 2021 during the nation&rsquo;s reapportionment of census-based distribution of the nation&rsquo;s 435 congressional representatives. With a smaller congressional delegation, the state would have less power to shape federal spending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While California Governor Gavin Newsom has not addressed the new numbers directly, when challenged by Fox News host Sean Hannity on California&rsquo;s population decline in a June 2023 interview, he said, &ldquo;.3% [population loss] during COVID. My gosh.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before the interview, Newsom&rsquo;s Department of Finance estimated the state&rsquo;s population had declined by 138,443 during 2022, making for a .36% population loss in a single year. Also using Department of Finance Data, the Public Policy Institute of California estimated a decline of 211,000 residents in 2022. Meanwhile, the latest Census data cited above, once accounting for a sharp rebound in immigration and decrease in deaths that offset the increase in outward immigration, estimates a population decrease of 113,000 for 2022. While the reason for the differences is not clear &mdash; the finance department notes that the discrepancy between its numbers and the Census reporting is due to different time frames being measured &mdash; the general trend of data demonstrating the state&rsquo;s general population decline is consistent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to PPIC polling, 45% of Californians are considering leaving the state due to the high cost of housing. Will Swaim, founder of the California Policy Center, acknowledges that housing is a major factor but that other costs, the lack of opportunity, and even the poor state of public education are leaving many Californians, especially parents, looking to move elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question that housing costs are huge, but that really ignores the myriad other ways that California has simply destroyed business opportunity, especially for the working class,&rdquo; said Swaim to The Center Square. &ldquo;It is a very expensive state to live in and the poorer you are the more that housing cost number hurts. But how about gasoline? Every week people are putting almost double what our fellow Americans in other states are putting in their cars.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those leaving the state are disproportionately younger and lower income. For many families, buying property and raising children in the state is no longer a viable option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are losing younger folks, and I think we will see people continuing to migrate where housing costs are lower,&rdquo; Manuel Pastor, a professor of sociology and American Studies &amp; Ethnicity at the University of Southern California, said in an interview with the Associated Press. &ldquo;There are good jobs in California, but housing is incredibly expensive. It hurts young families, and it hurts immigrant families.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swaim, who raised his children in California, noted that his now-adult children are left looking elsewhere for alternatives. Sharing his children&rsquo;s thoughts, he said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want our children to be educated in California's public schools, but we want them to be educated in private schools that we can&rsquo;t afford.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of students in California public schools do not meet the state&rsquo;s moderate standards for math, science, and English. When combining all sources of funding, California public schools spend approximately $27,000 per student. The Education Data Initiative estimates the average K-12 private school tuition in California is $16,337.</span></p>

<p><strong>CBP Agents Receive New Warning in Light of Israel-Hamas Conflict</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities along the U.S.-Mexico border are being warned by the San Diego Field Office of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to keep an eye out for "foreign fighters" connected to the terrorist groups waging war against Israel for the last two-plus weeks, another sign that the border crisis has wide-ranging national security implications.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First reported by the Daily Caller News Foundation's Jennie Taer, the "Situational Awareness" bulletin sent Friday is titled "Foreign Fighters of Israel-Hamas Conflict May Potentially be Encountered at Southwest Border" and is marked "unclassified/law enforcement sensitive."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bulletin explains:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Diego Field Office Intelligence Unit (SDFO-FITU) assesses that individuals inspired by, or reacting to, the current Israel-Hamas conflict may attempt to travel to or from the area of hostilities in the Middle East via transit across the Southwest border.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign fighters motivated by ideology or mercenary soldiers of fortune may attempt to travel to or from the US to or from countries in the Middle East through Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the items border agents are advised to watch for are military patches for Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and Hezbollah terrorist organizations &mdash; all funded by the regime in Iran.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other possible indicators are military age males, military gear including weapons, camouflage, and the previously mentioned terror group patches, single travelers, and those with undetermined return plans or associations to Israel, the Palestinian territories or regional affiliations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents are also given "questions of interest" to ask potential suspects with ties to the terrorist organizations to probe whether individuals have any "association with military or security services or government civilian agencies?" or "personal or familial association with Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP) or any other similar groups?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's unsurprising that there's growing fear that terror-linked individuals may be seeking to take advantage of the border crisis after a record-setting number of apprehensions and "gotaways" have been recorded on the Biden administration's watch, including an alarming number of individuals whose names matched with people listed in U.S. terror watch lists.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Iceland PM goes on strike over women's equal pay, gender-based violence</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime minister of Iceland went on strike Tuesday in protest of gender discrimination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Katrin yaker-stoder joined women across the country in a national demonstration against pay discrimination and gendered violence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have not yet reached our goals of full gender equality and we are still tackling the gender-based wage gap, which is unacceptable in 2023," Jakobsd&oacute;ttir told news outlet mbl.is.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nationwide protest, referred to as a "women's strike," is the first full day of widespread female absence from the workforce since 1975.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I will not work this day, as I expect all the women [in cabinet] will do as well," Jakobsd&oacute;ttir said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original protest aimed to emphasize the importance of women in the workforce and urge an end to disparate wages between female and male workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women in Iceland earn approximately 10% less on average compared to their male counterparts, according to the World Economic Forum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Icelandic women's rights movements have made greater headway in their campaigns, the scope and meaning of the protests have expanded to include other issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are still tackling gender-based violence, which has been a priority for my government to tackle," yakob-stoder said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iceland consistently ranks among the most gender-equal countries in the world in terms of education, employment and health care.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakobsd&oacute;ttir's cabinet maintains an equal number of men and women and Iceland's national parliament hovers just under 50% female.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Past Icelandic women's strikes have sparked similar protests in other European countries.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coca-Cola quietly deletes mentions of BLM from company website</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coca-Cola has been a financial sponsor of Black Lives Matter for years, however, references to its support of the organization appeared to have vanished from its website in light of recent posts shared by the group siding with Hamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BLM Chicago and an organizer from Los Angeles are among those associated with the purported civil rights group to have publicly voiced support for the Iranian-backed Palestinian terrorist group following its latest wave of violence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) revealed that he had caught the beverage giant "red-handed," posting two screenshots of its website, one of which included references to BLM, and an updated version that does not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coca-Cola had originally stated on its website that Sprite, which it owns, had donated $500,000 to the Black Lives Matter Global Network to "support the group's voting education efforts and their February 2021 Black Future Month program."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We're in this for the long haul," brand lead Aaliyah Shafiq noted. "Lasting change will not happen overnight, so we're committed to continuing to amplofy the voices and efforts of our community, to listen and learn, and to actively help create a better shared future for America."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the updated version of their website, Shafiq's quote is still there, however, the entire sentence highlighting the $500,000 contribution has been deleted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Editing your website is not enough," Cruz said. "Americans DEMAND an apology."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The posts in question were shared in the days following Hamas' brutal massacre of civilians in Israel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BLM Chicago featured an image of a paraglider with a Palestinian flag attached to his parachute. "That is all that it is!" was the caption.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before long, users utilized X's Community Notes feature to point out important context.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas used armed gun men on Paragliders to enter a rave in Israel to kill over 260 innocent people partying," the note read, adding that, "previous to this incident, Palestinians were not know[n] for paragliding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was later deleted, though the group did remain steadfast in its support for the Palestinians over Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"For every corporate donor who sent millions to BLM&mdash;including Amazon, Apple, BlackRock &amp; Bank of America&mdash;do you regret supporting such an antisemitic organization?" Cruz asked on his podcast Wednesday, according to Fox News.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organizer from Los Angeles, Dr. Melina Abdullah, said in her post that "we must stand unwaveringly on the side of the oppressed," adding, "when a people have been subject to decades of unimaginable violence, their resistance must not be condemned, but understood as a desperate act of self-defense."</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Over 12,000 US Troops Head toward Middle East on 10 Warships</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As tensions equate to World War Three levels in the Middle East, over 12,000 US Navy and Marine Corps personnel aboard ten warships are heading towards the Middle East, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III announced a series of actions to bolster the US military presence in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group has been redirected to the Central Command area of responsibility in addition to the Navy&rsquo;s most advanced nuclear aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, which is currently positioned in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group now joins the USS Gerald R. Ford group, bringing the number of American warships in the region to 10.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 4,500 sailors on board the US aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, accompanied by five other ships carrying over 1,600 US troops.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier is 5,000 service members, with further ships carrying another 1,000 troops.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin placed 2,000 forces on standby to &ldquo;be ready to deploy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forces will now be ready to be deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean within 24 hours, Fox News reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order came just days after a special operations Marine Corps unit participating in exercises departed early &ldquo;as a result of emerging events.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, Austin placed an unspecified number of US troops under &ldquo;prepare to deploy&rdquo; orders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin said in a statement:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have placed an additional number of forces on prepare to deploy orders as part of prudent contingency planning, to increase their readiness and ability to quickly respond as required.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, up to six Chinese Warships have been spotted in waters near the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a statement:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We need to enter under the best possible conditions, and this is what we are doing now, as the next stage of war approaches.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimizing the danger.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We will narrow the risks to our forces over the next stages. This is why we have once again urged residents of Gaza to keep moving south,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Daily Fetched reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many media outlets have taken Hagari&rsquo;s words as meaning they are preparing for an imminent ground assault.</span></p>

<p><strong>US Rushes Advanced THAAD Missile Defense to Mideast</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fears that the Israel-Hamas war could mushroom into a wider Middle East conflict rose on Sunday with Washington warning of a significant risk to U.S. interests in the region as ally Israel pounded Gaza and clashes on its border with Lebanon intensified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza's Health Ministry said 266 Palestinians, including 117 children, had been killed by Israeli air strikes in the past 24 hours in the enclave, to which Israel laid "total siege" after a deadly mass infiltration into Israel by Hamas gunmen on Oct. 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In neighboring Syria, where Hamas' main regional backer Iran has a military presence, Israeli missiles hit Damascus and Aleppo international airports early on Sunday, putting both out of service and killing two workers, Syrian state media said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, the Iran-backed Hezbollah group has clashed with Israeli forces in support of Hamas in the deadliest escalation of frontier violence since an Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With violence around its heavily guarded borders increasing, Israel on Sunday added 14 communities close to Lebanon and Syria to its evacuation contingency plan in the north of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh called on the international community to create "a united front" to stop Israel's attacks against Gaza and allow in desperately needed aid which has only begun to trickle in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We place at the top of our priorities stopping the Israeli aggression (...) and bringing in medical and relief aid to prevent a major humanitarian catastrophe," Shtayyeh said during a meeting with 25 ambassadors, representatives and consuls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Saturday that Washington would send more military assets to the Middle East in support of Israel and strengthen the U.S. defense posture in the region after "recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces" - a reference to Hezbollah, Palestinian and other militants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin told ABC's "This Week" program on Sunday: "We're concerned about potential escalation. In fact, what we're seeing ... is the prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation ... our advice is: don&rsquo;t," he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin said a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and extra Patriot air defense missile system battalions will be sent to the region and more troops put on standby.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iranian security officials told Reuters Iran's strategy was for Middle East proxies like Hezbollah to pursue limited strikes on Israeli and U.S. targets but to avoid a major escalation that would draw in Tehran, a high-wire act for the Islamic Republic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel unleashed an aerial blitz on Gaza to its southwest after Hamas militants breached the border on Oct. 7 and killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and took 212 hostages back to Gaza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza's Health Ministry said on Sunday that Israel's air and missile strikes in retaliation had killed at least 4,741 and wounded 15,898, with over a million of the densely populated enclave's 2.3 million people displaced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel has amassed tanks and troops near the fenced border around Gaza for a planned ground invasion aiming to annihilate Hamas, after several inconclusive wars dating to its seizure of power there in 2007, after Israel ended a 38-year occupation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Egyptian guards on the border with Gaza suffered minor injuries on Sunday after being accidentally hit by fragments of a shell from an Israeli tank, the Egyptian army said. Israel's defense force expressed "sorrow regarding the incident," which it said was being investigated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamas's armed wing said it had fired more rockets at Tel Aviv on Sunday. There was no immediate word of damage or casualties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Israel keeping up daily bombings, Palestinians said they received renewed Israeli military warnings to move from Gaza's north to the south to avoid the deadliest theater of the war.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said military leaflets dropped on the territory, just 45 km (28 miles) long, contained the added warning that they could be identified as sympathizers with a "terrorist organization" if they stayed put.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza's Health Ministry said most of the dead from air strikes over the past 24 hours were in Gaza's south. Israel says it is only targeting militants and that they often use residential buildings as cover.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first humanitarian aid convoy allowed into Gaza since war erupted arrived in southern Gaza from Egypt on Saturday after days of negotiations. The U.N. said the 20-truck convoy brought life-saving medical supplies and some food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second convoy of around 19 trucks loaded with medical and food supplies entered the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on Sunday and was being inspected before proceeding into Gaza, sources said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An explosion and ambulance sirens were heard on Sunday afternoon, shortly after the second convoy had entered the crossing, witnesses said. The cause and exact location were not immediately clear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.N. humanitarian office said the volume of aid entering so far was just 4% of the daily average before the hostilities and a fraction of what was needed with food, water, medicines and fuel stocks running out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deprived of electricity and water, Gazans in the southern town of Khan Younis said they were struggling to feed their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are suffering extremely, waiting since dawn to get bread. If this continues for two more days it will be catastrophic,&rdquo; said Saleh Skafi, a father of four from north Gaza now sheltering in Khan Younis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, on this note - let&rsquo;s take a look at the overall situation across the globe&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/20/biden-government-war-fears-israel-hamas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.axios.com/2023/10/20/biden-government-war-fears-israel-hamas</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Behind the Curtain: Rattled U.S. government fears wars could spread</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never before have we talked to so many top government officials who, in private, are so worried about so many overseas conflicts at once.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We don't like to sound dire. But to sound a siren of clinical, clear-eyed realism: U.S. officials say this confluence of crises poses epic concern and historic danger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the scenes: Officials tell us that inside the White House, this was the heaviest, most chilling week since President Biden took office just over 1,000 days ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Defense Secretary Bob Gates &mdash; who ran the Pentagon under presidents of both parties, George W. Bush and Barack Obama &mdash; tells us America is facing the most crises since World War II ended 78 years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explains the White House's system overload like this: "There's this gigantic funnel that sits over the table in the Situation Room. And all the problems in the world end up coming through that funnel to the same eight or 10 people. There's a limit to the bandwidth those eight or 10 people can have."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Israel's response to the Hamas terrorist attack, and growing fear of a spreading war that reaches to Iran and beyond. Officials point to the protests, threats and deadly, anti-American warnings of Arab nations after they thought &mdash; incorrectly &mdash; Israel struck a hospital in Gaza, killing hundreds. This is a preview of what they fully expect will be a worldwide response to the expected Israeli invasion of Gaza.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is deploying two aircraft carriers to the region. A U.S. Navy destroyer on Thursday shot down missiles from Yemen that appeared headed toward Israel. U.S. troops were fired on this week by drones in Syria and Iraq.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vladimir Putin meeting in China this week with Xi Jinping to further strengthen their anti-America alliance. In a new Foreign Affairs article that top officials are sharing, Gates argues that both leaders believe America and other big democracies "are past their prime and have entered an irreversible decline." Putin and Xi sniff weakness and are activating on many fronts&hellip;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Reuters headline says it all: "Russia says it is coordinating Middle East policy with China."</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A malicious Iran. It's unclear how involved Iran was in orchestrating or assisting the Hamas terrorist attack &mdash; but officials seem certain there are ties. More worrisome: U.S. officials fear Hezbollah &mdash; a much bigger terrorist group than Hamas, funded by Iran &mdash; will strike the moment Israel gets stuck in Gaza.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden said Thursday night in his Oval Office address: "Iran is supporting Russia in Ukraine, and it's supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there's the unhinged leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, and his frequent testing of long-range, nuclear-capable missiles. As Gates points out, the combined nuclear arsenal of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea "could within a few years be nearly double the size of" America's.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A new weapon is being deployed in all these conflicts: a massive spread of doctored or wholly fake videos to manipulate what people see and think in real time. The architects of these new technologies, in background conversations after demonstrating new capabilities soon to be released, say even the sharpest eyes looking for fake videos will have an impossible time detecting what's real. (We'll have a column coming soon to Go Deeper on this topic).</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fake video, on top of bots (fake people) and fake written content, is being used aggressively by all anti-American actors, intelligence officials say. Some experts estimate that more than 90% of content on the internet will soon be fake or manipulated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What scares officials is how all five threats could fuse into one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Department on Thursday issued a rare "Worldwide Caution," warning U.S. travelers abroad of "increased tensions in various locations around the world" that raise "the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These simultaneous threats are hitting at the very moment the American political system seems &mdash; and sometimes is &mdash; literally broken.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not just that Republicans don't have a House speaker and can't seem to elect one, or that we might shut down the government in the middle of this mess, or that we're hurtling toward another toxic presidential election in which big chunks of both parties want different candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former top intelligence officials tell us domestic unrest is one of their biggest fears &mdash; whether it's triggered by court rulings against President Trump or protests over war in the Middle East. Biden allies frame these flare-ups as a reminder that global chaos requires calm and experience. "With age comes wisdom," Ron Klain, Biden's first chief of staff, told us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there has been a total collapse of people's trust in the opposing party, the media, what they see or share on social platforms, and even the top-secret intelligence the government relies on to measure these threats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, as much as the five individual threats above, is what worries officials. They know things could get worse &mdash; fast &mdash; and require tough actions &mdash; fast. And no one knows whether Congress or the public could unite in an emergency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/10/22/londons-met-police-declare-calling-for-jihad-is-lawful-as-word-has-number-of-meanings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/10/22/londons-met-police-declare-calling-for-jihad-is-lawful-as-word-has-number-of-meanings/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>London Police Declare Calling for Jihad Is Lawful as Word has &lsquo;Number of Meanings&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police have come under criticism for their seemingly lax approach towards pro-Palestine demonstrations and for giving excuses for those calling for &ldquo;jihad&rdquo; against Israel on the streets of the British capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 100,000 anti-Israel protesters took to the streets of London on Saturday. Ahead of the demonstration, the Met police warned activists that they may face arrest if they were seen to be supporting proscribed terror groups like Hamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while several people were arrested and some investigations continue, the police force drew considerable backlash for appearing to excuse calls for jihad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to footage of a speaker calling for jihad while standing in front of a placard calling on the &ldquo;Muslim armies&rdquo; of the world to attack Israel, the Met said on X: &ldquo;The word jihad has a number of meanings but we know the public will most commonly associate it with terrorism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We have specialist counter-terrorism officers here in the operations room who have particular knowledge in this area. They have assessed this video, filmed at the protest in central London today, and have not identified any offences arising from the specific clip.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, recognising the way language like this will be interpreted by the public and the divisive impact it will have, officers have identified the man involved and will be speaking to him shortly to discourage any repeat of similar chanting.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet users on social media noted that the Metropolitan Police&rsquo;s own hate crime guide states: &ldquo;The offence of incitement to hatred occurs when someone acts in a way that is threatening and intended to stir up hatred&hellip; Hate content may include: messages calling for violence against a specific person or group.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1715732342604505530"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1715732342604505530</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Arabic word literally translates to &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; and has been used in other, more peaceful contexts, observers noted that the context of the call for jihad on Saturday in London was a literal war cry against Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalist Andy Ngo, who covered the London rally on Saturday, said: &ldquo;I was there and the speaker was specifically talking about getting military leaders and countries to mobilize armies of Muslims to go to Palestinian territories to assist the (those who do jihad) against Israel in a holy battle for Islam.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post has received widespread derision, with author Douglas Murray writing: &ldquo;Yes, oh Imam of the Met Police. Those guys definitely looked like they were calling for an intense inner spiritual struggle. Got it in one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political commentator Darren Grimes added: &ldquo;Shouting &lsquo;Jihad! Jihad! Jihad!&rsquo; won&rsquo;t get you arrested in Britain, but telling a copper that they look like your lesbian nan as a teenager will see six officers pound your door down.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[TCND: More Creation Talk (Do the Dishes, Men!) [The Comedian Next Door]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Neighbor! We want to apologize for the quality of our last episode.&nbsp; It was actually a GREAT conversation, if you were able to decipher it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, let's talk a little more about creation!&nbsp; &nbsp;In essentials, unity. In opinions, liberty. And in everything, love.&nbsp;<br /><br />That's all well and good, isn't it?&nbsp; But WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIALS?&nbsp;<br /><br />Most Christians don't care (on the surface) how old the earth is... but we DO care about making sure our kids understand "the essentials."&nbsp; So, if we're being told we MUST read Genesis a particular way in order to raise Christian kids, that will pique our interest.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most mothers are willing to write "24-hours" into their Bibles, if that's what it takes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are concerned with what affects their DAILY LIFE.&nbsp; In general, they're not impacted by whether God used millions of years to prepare the earth for humans, except that they're being told their kids will leave the faith if they DON'T teach Young Earth Creationism.&nbsp;<br /><br />Later:&nbsp; A Good Man Will Do the Dishes!!!&nbsp; (Listen as we explain why Michael Foster is way more interesting than Ken Ham.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be some Christians in reformed circles who are tired of talking about marriage, parenting, and other "basics." But we can't get tired of doing good! There are still many, many, many, many self-identified Christians who haven't learned how to LIVE like Christians, yet. Most of the moms in our home church are still sending their kids to public schools.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many are not even getting married and staying married. Many are still blaming their husbands (who fail to do the dishes) for their unhappiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to theology and growing in their walk with Christ--affirming that creation was accomplished in 24-hour days is not even a blip on the radar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Palestinian Protesters Stage &lsquo;Insurrection&rsquo; in U.S. Capitol Office Building</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-Palestinian protesters, who want a ceasefire that would benefit the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza, stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday and staged a protest inside the Cannon Rotunda that one observer likened to an &ldquo;insurrection.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cannon Rotunda is part of the Cannon House Office Building. It is separate from the iconic Capitol building but is considered part of the Capitol complex. It is the oldest congressional office building on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who falsely accused Israel of bombing a Gaza hospital Tuesday, addressed the protesters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox 5 in Washington, DC, reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large group of pro-Palestinian protesters are demonstrating inside the Cannon Rotunda on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cannon House Office Building holds the House Committee offices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Capitol Police say demonstrations are not allowed inside Congressional Buildings and are working to clear the crowd. Police have already detained some individuals as chants of &ldquo;ceasefire&rdquo; are echoing around the building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left-wing protesters have staged demonstrations inside the Capitol before, but none have been treated the way participants in the January 6, 2021 protesters have been treated, many of whom were detained and given harsh sentences for non-violent offenses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. has seen anti-Israel protests in major cities and on college campuses since a Hamas terror attack Oct. 7 killed 1,400 Israelis and wounded roughly 4,400 more. About 200 people &mdash; including some Americans &mdash; were taken to Gaza as hostages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI Director Christopher Wray called the Capitol riot &ldquo;domestic terrorism.&rdquo; In this case, the pro-Palestinian protest is supporting terrorism against Israelis and Americans; a ceasefire would allow Hamas to escape without consequences for its atrocities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/israel-war-harvard-columbia-students-lose-job-offer-law-firm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/israel-war-harvard-columbia-students-lose-job-offer-law-firm</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harvard and Columbia students lose law firm job offer for anti-Israel stance</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major law firm has rescinded its offer of employment to three students at Harvard and Columbia law schools who endorsed statements that blamed Israel for a series of terrorist attacks by Hamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law firm Davis Polk notified employees in an internal email that the firm had withdrawn job offers to three students from Harvard and Columbia who had signed statements that blamed the Israeli government for the attacks by Hamas. The Columbia statement went further and said the attacks were justified acts of resistance. The attacks and the subsequent military response by Israel have claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;These statements are simply contrary to our firm&rsquo;s values and we thus concluded that rescinding these offers was appropriate in upholding our responsibility to provide a safe and inclusive work environment for all Davis Polk employees,&rdquo; the firm said in the email to employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm's action is the latest example of students losing employment offers because of their support for the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryna Workman, a law student at New York University and the president of the student bar association, lost an employment offer from the law firm Winston &amp; Strawn after supporting a statement that said: &ldquo;Israel bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to withdrawn job offers, other prominent figures have urged that the students be named publicly and face professional consequences. A number of the 31 student groups who signed the Harvard statement have since withdrawn their support for the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billionaire Bill Ackman, a Harvard alum, asked that the names of the students who signed the statement be publicly released "so as to ensure that none of us inadvertently hire any of their members."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman echoed Ackman, saying, "I would like to know so I know never to hire these people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/sen-vances-new-bill-would-protect-mothers-who-exit-the-workforce-to-care-for-their-babies-from-undue-healthcare-costs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/sen-vances-new-bill-would-protect-mothers-who-exit-the-workforce-to-care-for-their-babies-from-undue-healthcare-costs</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Vance's new bill would protect mothers who exit the workforce to care for their babies from undue health care costs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Sens. J.D. Vance (Ohio) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) introduced legislation Tuesday that would ensure that mothers "who choose to prioritize their child's early development and recover rather than return to work" after giving birth won't be retroactively stripped of their health care premiums for having done so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 requires covered companies with over 50 employees to give their workers 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave in a 12-month period for the birth of a child as well as in cases of adoption. Furthermore, it requires the "continuation of their group health benefits under the same conditions as if they had not taken leave."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill, entitled "Fairness for Stay-At-Home Parents Act," would amend the FMLA to "prohibit an employer from recovering any health care premium paid by the employer for an employee if the employee fails to return to work due to the birth of a child, and for other purposes."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to preventing clawbacks, the legislation would have employers continue their health premium contributions for the duration of the 12-week leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our laws should not penalize new parents who choose to stay home to care for their newborn babies," Vance said in a statement. "We should celebrate and promote young families, not punish them. This legislation would relieve a serious financial burden for working families all over America and steer Washington in a more pro-family direction."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America appears to be in dire need of a "pro-family direction."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Census Bureau revealed in November 2022 that less than 24% of children under the age of 15 living in normal families had a stay-at-home mother. Only 1% had a stay-at-home father.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pew Research Center indicated that as of 2021, 26% of mothers stayed home with their children and 7% of fathers stayed home with their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Mayo Clinic, over half of women return to work after their maternity leave.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are fewer people staying home to raise their children, but fewer Americans are having children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated in a June report that the provisional number of births in the U.S. for 2022 was just over 3.6 million, a decline from the previous year. The fertility rate was 56.1 per 1,000 women ages 15-44. This figure is roughly half of what the rate was in the 1960s and more or less on par with the rate in 2020, which was the lowest rate on record.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times noted in 2018 that one of the key drivers behind Americans having fewer or no children is financial insecurity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll conducted by USA Today last year confirmed that was still the case. About 46% of respondents suggested their personal financial situation influenced their planned or current childlessness; 40% indicated work-life balance was at least partly to blame.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Examiner noted that financial struggles hit parents straight out the gate. The national average cost of child delivery in a hospital exceeds $18,000, or $3,000 out of pocket for those with insurance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12-week reprieve that some parents might find as a result of Vance's bill could go a long way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Fairness for Stay-At-Home Parents Act supports mothers' and parents' invaluable role in raising the next generation," said Rubio, the original co-sponsor of Vance's bill. "This legislation stops employers from imposing harsh financial penalties if a parent decides not to return to work after unpaid leave, and it empowers families to make choices that prioritize the well-being of their children."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubio, like Vance, appears keen on bolstering the family. Following the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling, Rubio released a pro-family framework, stressing the "need to adopt pro-life policies that support families, rather than destroy them."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the proposals in the Florida senator's framework were an expansion to the child tax credit; an allowance for new parents to pull forward up to three months of their Social Security benefits to finance paid parental leave; tax relief for adoptive parents; expanded support for pro-life crisis pregnancy centers; and the establishment of a grant program funding integrated mentoring services for poor mothers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the Manhattan Institute's Brian Riedl prophesied to the Washington Post that Republicans would likely take a stronger lead on bolstering the family beyond just sparing the unborn from mass extermination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I could see if Republicans decide that abortion politics are working against them, there could be a push for child-care benefits, more maternal health care, and better adoption services to make it easy and more affordable for more mothers to carry the babies to term," said Riedl. "It would put their money where their mouth is when challenged on making it easier for mothers to afford their children and get their health care."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONOR MCGREGOR WON&rsquo;T FACE CHARGES AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT DURING NBA FINALS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conor McGregor won&rsquo;t face charges stemming from allegations he sexually assaulted a woman during the NBA Finals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGregor was accused by a woman of sexually assaulting her in the bathroom of Kaseya Center during a Heat/Nuggets NBA Finals game, and the UFC star always maintained he didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors have now decided there is &ldquo;insufficient evidence&rdquo; to pursue the situation further, according to TMZ. Authorities also cited &ldquo;contradicting and/or no corroborating witnesses&rdquo; as another reason for why no charges will be brought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In light of the above facts and circumstances, the State would not be able to satisfy its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,&rdquo; prosecutors wrote in a closeout memo, according to the same TMZ report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman initially claimed security separated her from her friends to get her in a bathroom with McGregor, but video of the situation told a very different story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was filmed entering the bathroom with McGregor on her own freewill, and nobody was forcing her to go anywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TMZ also reported she was seen at a club with McGregor AFTER they left the bathroom together where she alleged she was assaulted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An attendant outside the bathroom told authorities they &ldquo;did not hear any signs of distress or sounds that would corroborate that whatever was occurring was not consensual.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGregor&rsquo;s attorney told TMZ, &ldquo;After a thorough investigation, including a review of videos and interviews with eyewitnesses, the authorities have concluded that there is no case to pursue against my client, Conor McGregor. On behalf of my client, his family and his fans we are pleased this is now over.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation is now behind McGregor, and that means he can focus on getting back in the octagon.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>John Cooper of the rock band Skillet returns to the podcast to discuss his forthcoming book, Wimpy, Weak and Woke. He explains how a spirit of entitlement and victimhood has pervaded Western society, with its philosophical roots in Hegel, the tragedy of Christians abandoning the truth of the Bible to capitulate to postmodern and politically correct assumptions, and offers a solution that begins at home, but grows outward to express the Kingdom of God in every area of life and society.</p>
