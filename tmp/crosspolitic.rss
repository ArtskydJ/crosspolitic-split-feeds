   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Thursday, August 10th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bohnet Music Academy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit Bohnetma.com/crosspolitic for more information on how to equip your family to serve God&rsquo;s musical commands. B-O-H-N-E-T MA.com/crosspolitic</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/fbi-shoots-and-kills-utah-man-wanted-for-biden-threats.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/fbi-shoots-and-kills-utah-man-wanted-for-biden-threats.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FBI shoots and kills Utah man wanted for threats against Biden, New York prosecutor</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI shot and killed a Utah man on Wednesday while trying to arrest him for threatening to murder President Joe Biden and the New York district attorney who is prosecuting President Donald Trump in connection with hush money payments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many other politicians were also allegedly threatened in social media posts by the man, Provo resident Craig Deleeuw Robertson, who was accused in court documents of vowing to retaliate against the FBI during an investigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court documents say the FBI described Robertson as a white man &ldquo;approximately 70-75 years old&rdquo; who was surveilled &ldquo;wearing a dark suit (later observed as having an AR-15 style rifle lapel pin attached), a white shirt, a red tie, and a multi-colored (possibly camouflage) hat bearing the word &ldquo;TRUMP&rdquo; on the front.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robertson was also found to be the owner of a sniper rifle and numerous other firearms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robertson was fatally shot by at least one FBI agent at 6:15 a.m. in Provo, about 12 hours before Biden was due to visit the state in Salt Lake City. No agents were injured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The incident began when special agents attempted to serve arrest and search warrants at a residence,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the FBI said in a statement. &ldquo;The subject is deceased.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooting is under review by the FBI&rsquo;s Inspection Division.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A senior administration official told NBC News that Biden was briefed on the FBI raid this morning, ahead of scheduled events in New Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for Biden, said in a statement, &ldquo;The Secret Service is aware of the FBI investigation involving an individual in Utah who has exhibited threats towards a protectee.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;While we always remain in close coordination with our law enforcement partners, this is an FBI-led effort and we would refer any related questions to the FBI,&rdquo; the Secret Service said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robertson allegedly had made a threat naming Biden on Monday, and also threatened in a social media post in March to shoot Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. during a visit to New York.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A felony complaint against Robertson filed in U.S. District Court in Utah charged him with making threats against the president, making interstate threats, and influencing, impeding, and retaliating against federal law enforcement officers by threat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bragg charged Trump earlier this year with falsifying business records related to a 2016 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about her alleged sexual tryst with Trump a decade earlier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump denies having sex with Daniels, and has pleaded not guilty in the case, which is scheduled to go to trial next year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/images-show-men-armed-rifles-body-armor-coming-southern-border"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/images-show-men-armed-rifles-body-armor-coming-southern-border</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Images show men armed with rifles, body armor coming across southern border</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News has obtained images that show suspected cartel gunmen coming across the U.S. southern border in Texas toting body armor and rifles &ndash; the latest instance of armed men believed to be cartel members at the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement sources tell Fox that the three men were spotted on Saturday evening by cameras in the Fronton area and were seen carrying rifles and wearing body armor as they move through the brush.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border Patrol agents, including the agency&rsquo;s BORTAC tactical unit, were deployed to the area but found nothing. It is the same area where law enforcement arrested five suspected members of the Northeast Cartel in June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest incident came just days after Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) drone operators in Eagle Pass spotted an armed smuggler in Eagle Pass carrying a long gun and guiding a group of illegal immigrants across the Rio Grande.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instance the man made it back to Mexico, authorities said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the overwhelming majority of migrants coming across the border do not have criminal records, the large numbers of people coming across has raised concerns &ndash; particularly from Republicans &ndash; about who may be among the hundreds of thousands of people who are able to evade Border Patrol agents. The head of Border Patrol announced last week that agents nabbed four sex offenders &ndash; some with convictions of crimes against children &ndash; at the border coming into the U.S. within a single day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The border has seen record-high migrant encounters since 2021, but numbers began to trend down after the end of Title 42 on May 11. There were 144,000 migrant encounters in June, down from over 200,000 in May. However, recently there are signs numbers have gone up in July, with the Washington Post reporting that initial numbers are up by 30%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has touted moves it is taking to reduce the reliance on smugglers, who control large parts of the Mexican side of the border and who migrants often need to deal with in order to be able to access the U.S. The administration has expanded a number of lawful pathways for migrants to enter the U.S. &ndash; and has touted an anti-smuggling campaign last year which led to thousands of arrests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon has authorized 400 troops to remain at the border until the end of August beyond their 90-day mission, as 1,100 return to their home base. Meanwhile, Fox News Digital reported last week that ICE is increasing the number of its special agents at the border and that DHS is calling for more agency volunteers to help with processing at the border in the event of a surge in numbers.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chinese using new smuggling route to enter US illegally</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An internal federal intelligence report indicates that U.S. authorities are concerned with a new Chinese migrant route that migrants are using to illegally cross into the United States through Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an internal federal intelligence report obtained by The Daily Caller, Chinese migrants are taking boats from the Bahamas to illegally enter the United States through Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Caller reported that the intelligence report lists gaps in intelligence, including where Chinese migrants are located in the Bahamas, who is coordinating the illegal immigration effort between the Bahamas and the state of Florida, and why Chinese migrants are engaging in &ldquo;self-smuggle&rdquo; operations from the Bahamas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report indicates five incidents of Chinese migrants attempting to smuggle themselves into the United States from the Bahamas. A recent smuggling attempt reportedly occurred on July 16, involving six Chinese migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Chinese purchased a Bahamian registered vessel in GBI and tested the capabilities before leaving and being interdicted in Palm Beach,&rdquo; the report stated. &ldquo;All 6 Chinese migrants were repatriated to the Bahamas.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. officials and experts have expressed concerns regarding the identity of the migrants and the possible dangers they could pose to the national security of the United States..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Customs and Border Protection data indicates that Florida&rsquo;s Border Patrol agents have experienced a major increase in illegal Chinese migrant arrests According to the data, Border Patrol agents arrested 27 illegal Chinese migrants from October of 2022 to June of this year, representing a significant increase from 5 total Chinese migrant arrests in the fiscal year of 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Daily Caller, the intelligence report does not indicate how many of the Chinese migrants utilized the smuggling route between the Bahamas and Florida.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Customs and Border Protection data also reveals that Border Patrol agents caught over 14,000 illegal Chinese migrants at the southern border from October of 2022 to June of this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Right now in China there&rsquo;s extreme pessimism, especially among people in their 20s about the future of their country, so it&rsquo;s understandable that they&rsquo;re leaving and they&rsquo;re trying to get into the United States,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homebuying Confidence at an All-Time Low</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 80% of Americans think it is a "bad" time to buy a home, a new Fannie Mae National Housing Survey finds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey, released Monday, found 82% believe it is a "bad time" to buy a house in July compared to 78% in June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monthly survey, launched in 2010, tracks attitudes on home ownership and renting, according to the organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is conducted by telephone with around 1,000 American adults who make financial decisions in households during the first three weeks of the month and is usually released around the 7th of the following month and has a margin of error of around plus or minus 0.4 or fewer percentage points.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though those surveyed expressed optimism in their personal financial outlook, rising home prices, and interest rates have kept them sour on entering the housing market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While consumers are reporting confidence in the components related to their personal financial situations, it's unlikely we'll see housing sentiment catch up to other broader economic confidence measures until there is meaningful improvement to home purchase affordability," Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president, and chief economist said in a press release announcing the findings Monday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In July, a significant majority of consumers indicated that their jobs are stable and that their incomes are the same or better than they were 12 months ago. However, homebuying sentiment once again matched its all-time low, with only 18% telling us that it's a good time to buy a home."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also found 36% of current homeowners are less likely to sell in the current market, unchanged from the results in June's survey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Unsurprisingly, consumers continue to attribute the challenging conditions to high home prices and unfavorable mortgage rates," Duncan said. "Further, the share of consumers expecting home prices to continue to rise has also been on a steady climb since March, which may only add to perceptions of unaffordability. Additionally, we have not seen much movement in the &lsquo;good time to sell' component over the last few months, an indication that the current low levels of existing homes for sale will likely continue to persist in the near term, as also reflected in our latest forecast."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found 41% believe that home prices will continue to rise, compared to 36% in June, with decreases in both those who say prices will stay the same, 37% to 34%, and prices will drop from 26% to 24% compared to the June results.</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Pugsters return to Glenn&rsquo;s turf this week, discussing the introduction of an article by John Mark Reynolds which modifies Lewis&rsquo;s idea of a &ldquo;discarded image&rdquo; in the loss of the medieval worldview, to a &ldquo;shattered image,&rdquo; in which elements of the medieval worldview survive, but in fragmented form. The conversation ranges from plague (another of Glenn&rsquo;s favorite topics), to the nature of the Renaissance, to the development of science, to the idea of progress, and a host of other related topics.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Podcast for Cultural Reformation, we&rsquo;re joined by Richard Fangrad of Creation Ministries International as we continue our series on issues facing the church. This week&rsquo;s issue is theistic evolution. Richard explains what the theory is, where it came from, and what is at stake in the evolutionary debate. As we&rsquo;ll see, our source of authority has real-life implications for the doctrine of God, the nature of man, ethics, worship, and much more.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>DeSantis launches major shakeup, replaces presidential campaign manager amid low polling</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a major shakeup weeks in the making, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign announced Tuesday it had replaced its campaign manager amid low polling in the 2024 GOP primary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis' gubernatorial chief of staff James Uthmeier replaced campaign manager Generra Peck, DeSantis' team confirmed to The Hill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peck will now work as the campaign's chief strategist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People have written Governor DeSantis&rsquo;s obituary many times," Uthmeier told The Messenger. "He&rsquo;s breaking records on fundraising and has a supporting super PAC with $100 million in the bank and an incredible ground game. Get ready."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, David Polyansky, former chief of staff for Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, will also join the campaign after serving as an adviser at the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"David Polyansky will also be a critical addition to the team given his presidential campaign experience in Iowa and work at Never Back Down," DeSantis' communications director Andrew Romeo said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican strategist and former Trump adviser Roger Stone predicted that 2024 presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will completely run out of money by the first of October.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest donor to the Florida governor said earlier this week that he was going to hold off funding until DeSantis could appeal more to moderates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is ahead of DeSantis in Republican primary polls with 53.2% to the Florida Republican's 15.1%, according to an average of polls analyzed by FiveThirtyEight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staffing changes come after the DeSantis campaign laid off more than one-third of its employees last month.</span></p>

<p><strong>Electric Vehicle Company Heavily Promoted by Biden Admin Goes Bankrupt</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra, an electric bus manufacturing company promoted by the Biden administration, had everything it needed to succeed - and failed anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Washington Free Beacon&rsquo;s Chuck Ross reported:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra cited "various market and macroeconomic headwinds" in a Chapter 11 filing on Monday, which came after the California-based firm cut hundreds of jobs earlier this year and restructured hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding debt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra stood to rake in millions from Biden's infrastructure and green energy initiatives, the former of which included at least $5 billion in spending on electric buses alone. Biden's flagship climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, also includes spending to help cities convert from diesel buses to electric buses, a major incentive for companies like Proterra.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JoAnn Covington, Proterra's chief legal officer, acknowledged last year that tax credits and federal grants under Biden's bills were a major incentive for the company. Grants to purchase electric buses and to create electric vehicle charging infrastructure would ​"open up opportunities to accelerate adoption of battery-electric and zero-emissions vehicles to all the other commercial segments on the cusp of being electrified," Covington said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm held non-public shares of proterra, which she sold in mid 2021 to an undisclosed buyer, pocketing over a $1 million profit in the process. She pledged to disclose the buyer, but never did. Proterra's stock only crashed from there, and Granholm&rsquo;s 240,000 shares would be worth roughly $60,000 total as of writing, had she still held them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year in February, Proterra&rsquo;s CEO Gareth Joyce was appointed by Biden to his Export Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year prior, Biden hosted a virtual White House event that spotlighted Proterra&rsquo;s business, which included the president of the company giving a virtual tour of the company&rsquo;s manufacturing facility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/biden-admin-has-given-2-35-billion-to-taliban-controlled-afghanistan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://freebeacon.com/national-security/biden-admin-has-given-2-35-billion-to-taliban-controlled-afghanistan/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biden Admin Has Given $2.35 Billion to Taliban-Controlled Afghanistan</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has provided more than $2.35 billion in taxpayer dollars to Afghanistan since the Taliban retook control of the government in 2021 following a deadly U.S. evacuation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States remains Afghanistan&rsquo;s top patron, even as lawmakers and federal oversight officials warn that these funds could be propping up the Taliban&rsquo;s terrorist government. Updated spending figures were disclosed Tuesday in a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a federal watchdog that documents waste, fraud, and abuse related to U.S. expenditures in the war-torn country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around $1.7 billion "remained available for possible disbursement" at the time of SIGAR&rsquo;s report, meaning that this money is ready to flow into non-profit groups and other entities working on reconstruction projects in Afghanistan. With the Taliban exerting control over nearly every sector of the country&rsquo;s infrastructure&mdash;including the NGO community&mdash;it is more than likely that a sizable portion of these funds will end up in the terror group&rsquo;s coffers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest figures are certain to increase congressional pressure on the Biden administration to stop sending taxpayer funds into Afghanistan until officials can ensure the Taliban is not stealing the money. John Sopko, head of SIGAR, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in April that he "cannot assure this committee or the American taxpayer we are not currently funding the Taliban." Sopko also accused the Biden administration of blocking his investigatory efforts and refusing to hand over documents that could show if the Taliban is being propped up by American cash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the two years since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan following the Biden administration's withdrawal of American forces in 2021, it has become increasingly clear that the terrorist group views international assistance as a "revenue stream," according to SIGAR&rsquo;s latest report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Institute of Peace recently warned the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the primary vehicle for U.S. spending in Afghanistan, that the Taliban is "pushing for ever-increasing degrees of credit and control over the delivery of aid." United Nations officials also disclosed to the watchdog that "the Taliban have effectively infiltrated and influenced most UN-managed assistance programming."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reality is raising questions about the nearly $2 billion in funds the Biden administration has made available for disbursement in the country. As U.S. aid money flows to the country, "Taliban interference with NGO work escalated, leading to a steady decline in humanitarian access in 2023, with a 32 percent increase in incidents between January and May 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022," according to the report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taliban government also has not moderated its jihadi principles since seizing the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As SIGAR and congressional oversight committees raise concerns about the Biden administration&rsquo;s push to pump money into Afghanistan, the government agencies in control of these expenditures are not cooperating with investigations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sopko revealed in April that the "the Department of State, USAID, the U.N., and other agencies are refusing to give us basic information that we or any other oversight body would need to ensure safe stewardship of tax dollars."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sopko revealed in April that the "the Department of State, USAID, the U.N., and other agencies are refusing to give us basic information that we or any other oversight body would need to ensure safe stewardship of tax dollars."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"More troubling," he added, "State and USAID have instructed their employees not to talk to SIGAR, and in one recent instance, State told one of its contractors not to participate in a SIGAR audit." The White House also would not cooperate with SIGAR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress has had similar experiences, with USAID declining to tell investigators what safeguards were put in place to ensure taxpayer cash is not stolen by the Taliban.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cousin, 17, of Uvalde school shooter arrested for allegedly threatening &lsquo;to do the same thing&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cousin to Uvalde school shooter Salvador Ramos was arrested after he was accused of threatening to shoot up a school and shoot his sister in the head, according to authorities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nathan Cruz, 17, allegedly told his sister he planned &ldquo;to do the same thing&rdquo; as his sicko cousin, who shot and killed 19 students and two staffers inside Robb Elementary School last year, according to an arrest warrant obtained by the San Antonio Express-News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Antonio officers responded to a mental health call after the teen suspect&rsquo;s mother grew worried Monday morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The suspect&rsquo;s mother was especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time, and for the fact that they live near an elementary school,&rdquo; the affidavit reportedly stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz also allegedly mentioned how &ldquo;school is starting soon,&rdquo; according to KSAT, which also obtained the warrant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz reportedly denied making any threats when speaking with detectives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz&rsquo;s mother said she overheard her son attempting to buy an AR-15 illegally over the phone, according to the warrant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family lives across the street from the Gardendale Early Learning Program, the newspaper reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the school shooting threat, he also threatened to shoot his sister in the head, the mother alleged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man&rsquo;s sister believed his threat was credible &ldquo;due to the recent history of their family and the suspect&rsquo;s knowledge of his cousin&rsquo;s actions,&rdquo; according to the San Antonio Express-News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz was booked on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to the public and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat to a family member, according to online records from the Bexar County jail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when you think Disney may have figured things out&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/08/07/disney-teams-up-with-transgender-tiktok-influencer-to-promote-girls-apparel-i-literally-look-like-minnie-mouse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/08/07/disney-teams-up-with-transgender-tiktok-influencer-to-promote-girls-apparel-i-literally-look-like-minnie-mouse/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disney Teams Up with Transgender TikTok Influencer to Promote Girls Apparel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Walt Disney Co. has teamed up with a transgender TikTok influencer to promote apparel for girls &mdash; specifically, Minnie Mouse-themed clothes that include a red dress, yellow pumps, and a red hair bow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender influencer Seann Altman &mdash; a biological male who identifies as &ldquo;gender fluid&rdquo; &mdash; created a promotional TikTok video for Disney Style,&nbsp; the company&rsquo;s social media brand promoting Disney-themed clothing, makeup, and accessories.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, which was first reported by the Twitter account @LeftismForU, he provides a dress-up tutorial to look like Minnie Mouse. The video was subsequently posted to Disney Style&rsquo;s official TikTok account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1688344659003629569"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1688344659003629569</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you just heard, Altman models a red dress, which he accessorizes with a white petticoat, yellow high-heel shoes, and a belt. He then adds artificial buns to his hair to simulate Minnie&rsquo;s ears and tops it off with Minnie&rsquo;s signature red bow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video is the latest example of Disney promoting transgenderism and gender non-conformity. As Breitbart News reported, Disneyland recently employed a mustachioed transvestite to welcome young girls into the park&rsquo;s Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past couple of years, Disney has fought Florida over its anti-grooming Parental Rights in Education law, created multiple transgender characters for its children&rsquo;s shows, put gay characters at the center of its big-budget movies, and even launched an LGBTQ-themed apparel line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Disney+ streaming service hosted This Is Me: Pride Celebration Spectacular, a musical special on YouTube starring drag queen Nina West, with performances of popular Disney songs re-imagined with LGBTQ themes.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3,000+ U.S. Sailors, Marines Reach Red Sea as Biden&rsquo;s Middle East Build-Up Continues</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwards of 3,000 U.S. sailors and Marines sailed into the Red Sea on Monday after transiting the Suez Canal in a pre-announced deployment, the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Fifth Fleet said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reinforcements were carried aboard the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall warships, providing &ldquo;greater flexibility and maritime capability&rdquo; to the Fifth Fleet, the statement seen by AFP added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their arrival followed a U.S. announcement last month it would deploy a destroyer, F-35 and F-16 warplanes, along with the Amphibious Readiness Group/Marine Expeditionary Unit, to the Middle East to deter Iran from seizing ships in the Gulf.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military says Iran has either seized or attempted to take control of nearly 20 internationally flagged ships in the region over the past two years and the Biden White House wants to see more forces in the region to stand ready to engage Iran if required, as Breitbart News reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USS Bataan is an amphibious assault ship which can carry fixed-wing and rotary aircraft as well as landing craft. The USS Carter Hall, a dock landing ship, transports Marines, their gear, and lands them ashore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;These units add significant operational flexibility and capability as we work&hellip; to deter destabilising activity and deescalate regional tensions caused by Iran&rsquo;s harassment and seizures of merchant vessels,&rdquo; Fifth Fleet spokesman Commander Tim Hawkins told AFP</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deployment comes after Washington said its forces blocked two attempts by Iran to seize commercial tankers in international waters off Oman on July 5.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a fifth of the world&rsquo;s crude oil and oil products passes through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow choke point between Iran and Oman.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mike Pence accidentally ADMITS he had legal ability to turn 2020 election over to House of Representatives</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Trump&rsquo;s arraignment on "conspiracy" charges last week, the 2024 GOP frontrunner&rsquo;s former vice president, Mike Pence, said that the 2020 election results would have been turned over to the House of Representatives if he rejected the Electoral College votes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1688640553808801792"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1688640553808801792</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Trump was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to defraud the government, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. He pleaded not guilty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the indictment from Special Counsel Jack Smith, he alleges that Trump enlisted six co-conspirators to "assist him in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indictment alleges that Trump was "determined to remain in power" after the 2020 election, and for the two months following the election "the Defendant spread lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he actually won."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"After it became public on the afternoon of January 6 that the Vice President would not fraudulently alter the election results, a large and angry crowd&mdash;including many individuals whom the Defendant had deceived into believing the Vice President could and might change the election results&mdash;violently attacked the Capitol and halted the proceeding. As violence ensued, the Defendant and co-conspirators exploited the disruption by redoubling efforts to levy false claims of election fraud and convince Members of Congress to further delay the certification based on those claims," the indictment stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence is currently running against his former administration partner for the GOP nomination, with Pence usually polling in the single digits While Trump leads anywhere from 40 to 60 points.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sikh Man Who Turned the Tables on Shoplifter Facing Criminal Charges</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As RedState reported, a Sikh convenience store owner turned the tables on a shoplifter as he attempted to get away with thousands of dollars of stolen merchandise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The viral scene unfolded in California, showing a man shoveling entire shelves worth of tobacco and other products into a trash can while taunting the owner with proclamations that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing you can do.&rdquo; The shoplifter quickly learned that wasn&rsquo;t true, though, as he was tackled to the ground and beaten with a rod.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1686713571994959872"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1686713571994959872</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play 1:15-1:56</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, while many California cities have no desire to actually enforce the laws against people who steal from business owners and put them in financial peril, they are interested in enforcing battery laws involving the protection of said businesses. According to a new report, the Sikh man is now facing criminal charges as local police investigate the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are making the argument that the force used on the shoplifter in the video was excessive, and as a purely legal matter, that may be true. The shoplifter was begging for mercy while the store owner continued to swing back and strike him. The question is at what point the store owner is expected to disengage, and he likely passed that point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I think that argument misses the broader point of what normally law-abiding citizens are dealing with and what the ultimate consequences are of refusing to enforce the law against criminal vagrants. These business owners (and also just people walking down the street) are being ignored by local police and prosecutors as they are harassed, assaulted, and stolen from. It was just a matter of time before someone reached their breaking point and lashed out.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/education/sunillegal-immigrants-colleges-soars-nearly-2-population-study-finds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/education/sunillegal-immigrants-colleges-soars-nearly-2-population-study-finds</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Illegal immigrants in colleges soar to nearly 2% of population, study finds</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 408,000 students without legal documentation to be in the country enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities, yet another system impacted by the surge in illegal immigration, according to a new study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new report by the American Immigration Council and the Presidents&rsquo; Alliance on Higher Education, found that undocumented migrants now account for nearly 2 percent of the higher education population.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority, the authors noted, arrived in the U.S. in their formative years, either as children or teenagers and most often through president Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program that blocked deportation of certain foreign youth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These students, often referred to as "Dreamers," have grown up in &ldquo;American neighborhoods and attended American schools,&rdquo; and now they are attending U.S. colleges, often on the American taxpayers' dime. Recent data shows that taxpayers pay $182 billion each year to provide services and benefits to illegals and their dependents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current total of illegal alien college students actually represents a slight decrease from 2019, when 427,000 undocumented students were enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report noted that &ldquo;undocumented students in higher education are concentrated in a small number of states.&rdquo; In fact, 75 percent of undocumented students reside in&nbsp; 12 states. The vast majority of this 75 percent hail from just four states: California, Texas, Florida and New York.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study also gives significant detail on which colleges and universities are the biggest draw for illegal aliens: more than 77 percent are enrolled in &ldquo;public two- and four-year colleges and universities, with a significant proportion of these students attending community colleges,&rdquo; it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/08/06/sick-joke-megan-rapinoe-ends-her-career-with-missed-penalty-kick-that-costs-u-s-the-world-cup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/08/06/sick-joke-megan-rapinoe-ends-her-career-with-missed-penalty-kick-that-costs-u-s-the-world-cup/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team USA lost last night, and I&rsquo;m THRILLED!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Megan Rapinoe Ends Her Career with Missed Penalty Kick that Costs U.S. the World Cup</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The international career of Megan Rapinoe ended in a dramatic penalty shoot-out against Sweden on Sunday with her failed kick at goal helping to send the U.S.A. team crashing out of the soccer World Cup underway in New Zealand and Australia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe and Sophia Smith missed penalties that could have given the U.S. the win, and Kelley O&rsquo;Hara missed the Americans&rsquo; final shot to give Sweden the opening it needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe, who I&rsquo;ve covered in the past, spoke to the media afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1688167422371536896"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1688167422371536896</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result ended the international career of Rapinoe, the Golden Boot winner of the 2019 tournament who is retiring after the World Cup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the earliest exit in tournament history for the United States, four-time winners of the World Cup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States claimed the last two Women&rsquo;s World Cups and four of the eight editions held before this year&rsquo;s event Down Under.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had never gone out before the semi-final stage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time they have been sent packing in the last 16 having won just one game and that an unconvincing 3-0 defeat of Vietnam.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brought off the bench against Sweden, her final act for her country was to put her penalty over the bar and send her country&rsquo;s hopes with it into oblivion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of soccer fans on twitter moved to voice their exasperation with her final effort.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapinoe pushes that equal pay talk, and then this happens&hellip; gotta love it.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Comedian, John Branyan, sits down with the Casting Crowns Musician, Juan DeVevo, to discuss the culture through the lens of memes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the late release of this episode.</p>
<p>Points of interest:</p>
<p>-God doesn't need us to defend Him from the Atheist Memes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Do Christians make Jesus sad enough to smoke?</p>
<p>-Does God pitch fits and get angry like a petulant toddler?</p>
<p>-"The Liar from the beginning was God; the Serpent told the truth."&nbsp; (Yes, someone actually made a meme with these words.)</p>
<p>-"God is not limited by the facts...choose faith instead of facts!"&nbsp; (Yes, another direct quote from a really stupid meme.)</p>
<p>AND MORE!</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Friday, August 4th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit Bohnetma.com/crosspolitic for more information on how to equip your family to serve God&rsquo;s musical commands. B-O-H-N-E-T MA.com/crosspolitic</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooter-sentenced-to-death-by-jury"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooter-sentenced-to-death-by-jury</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooter Sentenced To Death By Jury</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A jury on Wednesday sentenced the man who gunned down 11 people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh to death, nearly five years after the attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooter, whom I will not name, was found guilty in June of all 63 counts he was facing, including 11 counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of hate crimes resulting in death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jury&rsquo;s unanimous decision was announced by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Colville, who presided over the trial, which took place in downtown Pittsburgh. The judge will officially sentence the shooter to death later this week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victims were from three Jewish congregations who gathered at the Tree of Life synagogue on October 27, 2018. Two other worshipers and five police officers were also wounded by the gunman, who unloaded a Colt AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and three Glock .357 handguns during his attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victims of the shooting were: Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil and David Rosenthal, Bernice and Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, and Irving Younger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooting is considered by authorities to be the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys representing the shooter asked for a life sentence if he pleaded guilty, but prosecutors, with the support of most of the victims&rsquo; families, refused and took the case to trial to pursue the death penalty. The shooter&rsquo;s lawyers also argued that he was impaired by mental illness and a delusional belief system took over his thinking, dictating that he had to kill Jews to stop a genocide of white people, the Associated Press reported.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;He turned this place of worship into an exhibit in his criminal trial,&rdquo; U.S. Attorney Eric Olshan said while arguing for jurors to recommend the death penalty, according to the Pittsburgh Gazette.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A criminal complaint showed that the man told authorities he intentionally targeted the synagogue because he hoped to kill Jewish people. The shooter&rsquo;s defense attorneys acknowledged that he had done the shooting but asked jurors to &ldquo;scrutinize his intent.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now go across the pond for this one!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/08/02/uk-tories-enforce-diversity-quotas-for-new-members-of-parliament/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/08/02/uk-tories-enforce-diversity-quotas-for-new-members-of-parliament/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UK Tories Enforce Diversity Quotas for New Members of Parliament.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Kingdom&rsquo;s &lsquo;Conservative&rsquo; Party has implemented new diversity quotas and guidelines for selecting candidates &ndash; would-be Members of Parliament (MPs). The targets include age as well as ethnicity and gender.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity quotas are in place even before candidates are considered as the party&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sifting Committee,&rdquo; which is responsible for sorting through applicants after applying for the position, must have specific characteristics:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;The Sifting Committee must comprise a minimum of one woman and one young person under the age of 30. The additional Association members of the Committee should reflect the different interests of the constituency, i.e. should have a balance of gender, age and ethnicity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the initial sift, the Selection Committee must &ldquo;recognise their responsibility&rdquo; to ensure that candidates are chosen in a way that &ldquo;displays diversity and variety and which has a due regard to the local profile of the constituency&rdquo; and guarantees a balance of genders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selection rules also state that the process must be &ldquo;inclusive and free from discrimination&rdquo; and &ldquo;fully acknowledge and embrace diversity,&rdquo; except when considering female candidates, in which case &ldquo;some degree of positive discrimination is permitted.&rdquo; The rules add that anything considered &ldquo;indirect discrimination&rdquo; is prohibited; meaning, any requirement that could have a &ldquo;disproportionate impact&rdquo; on one group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;President Donald Trump highlighted the Conservative&rsquo;s shift to the &ldquo;far left&rdquo; in an interview with Nigel Farage earlier this year. More recently, the party expelled a mayor for &lsquo;repenting&lsquo; after attending a Pride event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/02/orlando-magic-nba-team-donated-ron-desantis-super-pac"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/02/orlando-magic-nba-team-donated-ron-desantis-super-pac</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Orlando Magic donated $50,000 to Ron DeSantis Super Pac</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orlando Magic NBA team has donated $50,000 to a Super Pac supporting the presidential bid of Florida&rsquo;s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Federal Election Commission records, the Never Back Down Super Pac received the donation made by the basketball team on 26 June. Further results showed the team making donations to other political causes in past years, with $500 going to Conservative Results in 2016, $2,000 to Maverick Pac USA in 2014 and another $500 to Linda Chapin for Congress in 2000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an initial statement to Popular Information, a Magic spokesperson said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t comment publicly on political contributions.&rdquo; However, in a later follow-up statement, a spokesperson clarified the donation, saying that the check was &ldquo;dated/delivered on May 19&rdquo;, five days before DeSantis declared his presidential bid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This gift was given before Governor DeSantis entered the presidential race. [It] was given as a Florida business in support of a Florida governor for the continued prosperity of central Florida,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Never Back Down&rsquo;s website, the Super Pac describes itself as a &ldquo;grassroots movement to elect Governor Ron DeSantis for president in 2024&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The donation has drawn criticism online, particularly given the Magic&rsquo;s claims of supporting &ldquo;diversity, equity and inclusion all year long&rdquo; and DeSantis&rsquo;s culture wars in which he announced plans to block DEI programs in state colleges among other legislation targeting minority and marginalized groups including LGBTQ+ communities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orlando Magic team is under Amway North America, a multi-level marketing firm co-established by Richard DeVos, the late father-in-law of Trump&rsquo;s education secretary Betsy DeVos.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the DeVos family has made multiple donations to conservative organizations. In 2006, the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation made a $540,000 donation to Focus on the Family, a Colorado-based organization that opposes same-sex marriage and abortions, HuffPost reports. In 2008, Richard DeVos donated $100,000 to Florida4Marriage, a group that campaigned to add a state constitutional ban on same-sex marriages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a sacred issue of respecting marriage,&rdquo; Richard DeVos said in a 2009 interview in reference to his donation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following reports of the donation, the National Basketball Players Association, a union representing NBA players, issued a statement on Wednesday, calling the donation &ldquo;alarming&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A political contribution from the Orlando Magic is alarming given recent comments and policies of its beneficiary. NBA governors, players and personnel have the right to express their personal political views, including through donations and statements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;However, if contributions are made on behalf of an entire team, using money earned through the labor of its employees, it is incumbent upon the team governors to consider the diverse values and perspectives of staff and players.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Magic&rsquo;s donation does not represent player support for the recipient,&rdquo; the union said.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/shakeups-continue-at-espn-as-nba-analyst-mark-jackson-is-fired-after-10-years-with-the-network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2023/08/shakeups-continue-at-espn-as-nba-analyst-mark-jackson-is-fired-after-10-years-with-the-network/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shakeups Continue at ESPN As NBA Analyst Mark Jackson Is Fired After 10 Years With The Network</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Jackson is a New York native who played his college basketball at St. John&rsquo;s before being chosen by the Knicks in the first round of the 1987 draft. He spent two separate stints with the franchise, and his time in the shadows of The City That Never Sleeps had him ready for the big stage when he wanted to transition to television.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He would go on to a coaching career by taking the helm in Golden State, just before the eventual arrival of Steve Kerr and a slew of NBA titles. Still, he rebounded nicely, and would later famously team with Mike Breen and Van Gundy to form one of the best broadcasting trios in all of sports. That is &ndash; until this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Mark Jackson released a long statement, saying goodbye:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This morning, unexpectedly, I was informed that my services were no longer needed at ESPN. Although shocked and dismayed with the suddenness of it all, I would like to thank ESPN and all the staff of the NBA ESPN crew for allowing me to be a part of the organization for the past 15+ years. I would also like to thank the NBA fans watching at home and in the arenas throughout the league for all of your support. To the NBA, a heartfelt thank you for allowing a kid to continue to accomplish his dreams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It has been an honor to sit beside two LEGENDS in the business, who are like brothers to me, Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy, and learn so much from them,&rdquo; the former Knicks standout continued. &ldquo;Lisa Salters is a GOAT and like a sister to me and I&rsquo;m so proud of the work she continues to do. To the best producer in the world, and my friend, Tim Corrigan, I give the utmost gratitude and thanks for always inspiring and supporting me. To all of the staff and crew, that may have never been seen on camera&hellip; please know that you were always seen by me and so greatly appreciated.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson then concluded his sign-off from The Worldwide Leader in Sports gracefully, giving praise to God on his way out the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Finally, I wish greater measures of success to the new ESPN team. May they continue to elevate this game that has given me a home and a life. I leave ESPN with nothing but gratitude, all the while knowing that my highest praise goes to God! Through it all, He has always sustained me and His grace allows me to know that there are greater blessings ahead. I look forward to what He has in store next.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson&rsquo;s layoff is the latest in a series of cost-cutting moves by the network, which has experienced a sharp drop in popularity and profitability in recent years.</span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[Daily News Brief for Thursday, August 3rd, 2023 [Daily News Brief]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Thursday, August 3rd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit Bohnetma.com/crosspolitic for more information on how to equip your family to serve God&rsquo;s musical commands. B-O-H-N-E-T MA.com/crosspolitic</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://bohnetma.com/crosspolitic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://bohnetma.com/crosspolitic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to this! Some good education news&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/hs-seniors-con-vs-lib"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/hs-seniors-con-vs-lib</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>High school senior boys nearly twice as likely to be conservative as liberal: Survey</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A University of Michigan survey found that boys in their senior year of high school are almost two times more likely to identify as conservative than as liberal. However, for twelfth-grade girls, they are even more likely to consider themselves liberal than conservative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Monitoring the Future survey, which is considered a scholarly endeavor that dates back to the 1970s, according to The Hill, political differences that were once somewhat close have drifted farther apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For high school senior boys, the shares of conservative versus liberal were nearly identical between 2014 and 2016, around 19% for both factions. By 2022, that number had shifted to 23% for conservative, which was actually down three points from 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that 2016 marker, boys identifying as liberal in grade twelve have plummeted to 13%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020-2023 numbers are the highest they've been for conservatives since the early 1990s, although the figures have nearly always hovered around the 20% mark, save for 1998-2002.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a reminder that while this is positive, conservatism without Christ is what got us to this point where we are now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now an update from Budlight.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/31/distributors-bud-light-beer-dylan-mulvaney-anheuser-busch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/31/distributors-bud-light-beer-dylan-mulvaney-anheuser-busch/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Distributors Giving up on Bud Light - No Longer Expect Beer Giant to Recover&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The embarrassment is real for Bud Light.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several distributors of Anheuser-Busch beer say they have accepted the fact they&rsquo;ve lost money &mdash; and a lot of it &mdash; due to consumers boycotting Bud Light. And not just that, but they&rsquo;ve also given up completely on trying to win back customers who have been negatively affected by the anti-American beer&rsquo;s Dylan Mulvaney campaign, according to the New York Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring freezes and layoffs have been going on for four months, while some beer truck drivers have been slammed with hecklers and other harassment while Bud Light&rsquo;s sales have tanked over 25%. As a result, wholesalers of Anheuser-Busch have resigned to the large number of customers they&rsquo;ve lost permanently, and in response, they need to focus on a new set of beer drinkers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Consumers have made a choice,&rdquo; an unidentified executive from a Texas-based beer distributor told the New York Post. &ldquo;They have left [Bud Light] and that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to be. I don&rsquo;t envision a big percentage of them coming back.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Anheuser-Busch branded beers such as Budweiser, Busch Light and Michelob Ultra have also been tanking in sales since Bud Light decided to disastrously partner with Mulvaney.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive went on to say that customers have most likely found out that Bud Light competitors including Miller Lite and Coors Light &ldquo;are a very similar product.&rdquo; Reigning victorious in the beer war all comes down to &ldquo;whoever is best at marketing,&rdquo; the executive told The Post.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Meta Starts Blocking Canadian News Content</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta has announced it has started blocking news content for Canadian users on its platforms, following months of threats to strike back against the Online News Act, which mandates that major tech companies pay Canadian media outlets for news content linked on their platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting Aug. 1, Meta begins the process of ending news availability in Canada, the company said in a statement. Over the next few weeks, all users accessing Facebook and Instagram in Canada will no longer be able to view news links and content posted by Canadian news publishers and broadcasters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta said the news outlets to be affected will be identified based on legislative definitions and guidance from the Online News Act, also known as Bill C-18. The bill received royal assent on June 22.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech giant Google also said it would retaliate against the the new law. The company announced on June 29 it would remove links to Canadian news from its Search, News, and Discover products, while users in Canada will no longer be able to operate the Google News Showcase.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being appointed the new heritage minister, Pascale St-Onge said her door is "always open" to negotiate with the tech companies, but that her government would not back down. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the issue a "dispute over democracy."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 10, Heritage Canada said it would propose regulations to implement the act, which would include establishing a financial threshold for the contributions of tech companies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Epoch Times reached out to Heritage Canada for comment but didn't immediately hear back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta says the new legislation is based on an "incorrect premise," that the company gains unfair benefits from news content shared on its platforms. The company also emphasized that the primary usage of its platforms doesn't revolve around news consumption, arguing instead that news outlets voluntarily share content on Facebook and Instagram to expand their audiences and bolster their financial standing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Online News Act is fundamentally flawed legislation that ignores the realities of how our platforms work, the preferences of the people who use them, and the value we provide news publishers," Meta said. "As the Minister of Canadian Heritage has said, how we choose to comply with the legislation is a business decision we must make, and we have made our choice."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company assured users that despite the changes regarding news content availability in Canada, their products and services would remain unaffected. Users will continue to have the ability to connect with friends and family, grow their businesses, and support their local communities as before, Meta says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Canada&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-wife-18-years-announce-separation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-wife-18-years-announce-separation</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, wife of 18 years announce separation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday announced that he and his wife Sophie are separating after 18 years of marriage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trudeau made the announcement in an Instagram post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Sophie and I would like to share the fact that after many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate," Trudeau wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophie Gr&eacute;goire, a former television reporter in Quebec, married Trudeau in 2005. They have three children together.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with Maclean's magazine in 2005, Trudeau shared that he and Gr&eacute;goire-Trudeau met as adults two years prior, when they co-hosted the Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix ball. Before, Gr&eacute;goire had been a childhood friend of Trudeau's youngest brother, Michel &mdash; who died in an avalanche in 1998 at the age of 23 &mdash; and had spent time at the Trudeau family's home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple became engaged in October 2004 and married on May 28, 2005, at a ceremony at Montreal's Sainte-Madeleine Church.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trudeau has spoken glowingly of his wife in public in the years since. In April, the prime minister posted a pair of selfies with his wife on social media on her birthday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"From this, to this, and everything in between, there&rsquo;s no one I&rsquo;d rather have by my side," he wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also praised her on Mother's Day in May, calling Sophie and his mother "two of the strongest, bravest, and greatest people we know."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime minister's office said in a statement that Trudeau, 51, and Sophie, 48, have signed a legal agreement making their separation official.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/russia-ukraine-war/2023/08/01/id/1129190/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/russia-ukraine-war/2023/08/01/id/1129190/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Russia Accuses Ukraine of Moscow Drone Attack</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian authorities accused Kyiv early Tuesday of yet another attack on Moscow and its surroundings with drones, one of which hit the same building in the capital that was damaged by a drone just days ago in a similar attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russian officials have claimed that the intensified attacks on the capital region reflect failures in Ukraine's counteroffensive, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said over the weekend that "the war is gradually coming back to Russian territory," but stopped short of taking responsibility for the attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The repeated drone strikes underscore Moscow's vulnerability as Russia's war in Ukraine drags into its 18th month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Russian military also said that Ukrainian forces tried to attack two of its warships in the Black Sea overnight, using maritime drones. Three drones targeted two patrol vessels, Sergei Kotov and Vasily Bykov, 340 kilometers (210 miles) southwest of the Russian-controlled city of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula, the Defense Ministry reported. All three drones were destroyed, the report said.</span></p>

<p><strong>LOS ANGELES DODGERS HOST FAITH NIGHT AFTER &lsquo;SISTERS OF PERPETUAL INDULGENCE&rsquo; DISASTER; CHRIS PRATT, CLAYTON KERSHAW ATTEND</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, the L.A. Dodgers hosted their first &ldquo;Christian Faith and Family Day&rdquo; at Chavez Ravine since 2019 and nearly two months since LA honored &ldquo;Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence,&rdquo; an LGBT group whose past digs at religion drew criticism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a loss to the Cincinnati Reds, hundreds of Dodgers fans remained seated to partake in the team&rsquo;s &ldquo;Christian Family and Faith&rdquo; event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunday&rsquo;s postgame festivities included testimonies &mdash; emphasizing the importance of faith in God &mdash; from Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw, third baseman Max Muncy, utility player Chris Taylor and movie star Chris Pratt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pratt was in charge of throwing Sunday&rsquo;s ceremonial first pitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dodgers skipper Dave Roberts also made an appearance. Roberts, like much of the Dodgers personnel in attendance for the event, identifies as Christian.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;My relationship w/ Christ is the most important thing in my life,&rdquo; Roberts previously shared, when discussing the impact of faith on his life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kershaw drew the most attention from the media once the event was announced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dodgers pitcher objected to the celebration of the &ldquo;Sisters&rdquo; when the Pride Night event was first publicized in May.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clayton Kershaw&rsquo;s critics saw the revival of &ldquo;Christian Faith and Family Night&rdquo; &mdash; originally canceled due to COVID in 2020 &mdash; as a countermeasure to the Pride Night event featuring the &ldquo;Sisters.&rdquo; The ace called it coincidental timing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OutKick&rsquo;s Ian Miller attended the event on June 16 and noted that the Dodgers seemingly buried noise around it as 2,000 or so Dodgers fans showed up to protest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While June&rsquo;s event was met with backlash due to the &ldquo;Sister&rsquo;s&rdquo; mockery of the Christian and Catholic faith, Sunday&rsquo;s event was met with delight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LA team has long been worshipped by the Latino community of Southern California, so naturally the fanbase has a strong Catholic representation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As detailed by Los Angeles Times&rsquo; Helene Elliott, fans in attendance for the event adamantly cheered Dave Roberts for his appearance at the faith-based event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elliott called it a &ldquo;very forgiving crowd,&rdquo; considering the team had just lost, 9-0, to Elly De La Cruz and the Cincinnati Reds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To a degree, the Dodgers fans&rsquo; adoration after a deflating loss was emblematic of the idea of &ldquo;grace&rdquo;.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today the Pugs respond to an article by Matthew B. Crawford--the author of Shop Class as Soulcraft--entitled: What is Vitalism? After distinguishing what Crawford is talking about from the vitalism of earlier thinkers, the Pugs sympathetically reflect on his main argument--namely, that the over-management of life by the professional managerial class infantilizes people and makes them weak and incompetent. His solution is a return to the real world and manual and mental competence. Tune in and see if you agree!</p>

   <title><![CDATA[Daily News Brief for Wednesday, August 2nd, 2023 [Daily News Brief]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, August 2nd, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit Bohnetma.com/crosspolitic for more information on how to equip your family to serve God&rsquo;s musical commands. B-O-H-N-E-T MA.com/crosspolitic</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.based-politics.com/2023/07/31/were-paying-billions-in-taxes-for-federal-offices-that-are-sitting-mostly-empty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.based-politics.com/2023/07/31/were-paying-billions-in-taxes-for-federal-offices-that-are-sitting-mostly-empty/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;re paying billions in taxes for federal offices that are sitting mostly empty</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Based Politics.com:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic changed how people work, with remote work becoming wildly more prominent. And the federal government was no exception. But now, post-pandemic, taxpayers are on the hook for billions to fund federal offices that are sitting mostly empty, a new report reveals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month the Government Accountability Office published a report examining the utilization of current federal workspaces, as John Kartch explains for Americans for Tax Reform, and its results were remarkable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Kartch notes, the report found that all 24 federal agencies&rsquo; headquarters are &ldquo;vastly underutilized&rdquo; with most headquarters under 25% capacity and several below 10% capacity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s right: Many federal offices are 75% or even 90% empty. These include the Department of Agriculture, Department of Education, Department of Transportation, Small Business Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and more cabinet-level agencies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does this matter? Well, as Kartch writes, &ldquo;Taxpayers pay for air conditioning, heating, maintenance, and security for agency buildings at a cost of billions per year, while the same agencies lecture Americans about &lsquo;climate&rsquo; and the type of stove you have in your home.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn&rsquo;t cheap. The GAO report notes that &ldquo;The federal government owns 511 million square feet of office space, costing billions annually to operate and maintain.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s money out of our pockets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2023/07/30/report-california-loses-nearly-350-million-to-migration-out-of-state/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2023/07/30/report-california-loses-nearly-350-million-to-migration-out-of-state/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>California Loses Nearly $350 Million to Migration Out-of-State</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State of California lost nearly $350 million in tax revenues in 2021 due to migration out of the state &mdash; a worrisome figure as the state contemplates a new deficit of $32 billion this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real estate website MyEListing.com reported:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California ranks first among states experiencing the worst net negative tax income migration. With a staggering net loss of $343.2 million, the Golden State is witnessing an outflow of high-income earners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its numerous attractions, from the booming tech industry and world-class universities to beautiful landscapes and cultural richness, California&rsquo;s high personal income tax rates seem discouraging for many high-wealth individuals. This, coupled with the state&rsquo;s high cost of living, will likely fuel a wealth migration out of California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These trends affect the state&rsquo;s economy, especially the real estate and job markets. The departure of high-income earners can decrease demand for luxury real estate and potentially affect the commercial real estate sector. It also impacts job creation, as these high-income individuals often play a significant role in business expansion and entrepreneurial activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York was second, losing $299.6 million; and Illinois was third, with a net loss of $141.7 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has focused on attacking conservative states like Florida, but he is losing residents &mdash; and tax revenues to those states. MyEListing.com notes that Florida and Texas led all other states in &ldquo;positive tax migration.&rdquo; Arizona, currently governed by Democrats, was third.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsom enjoyed a budget surplus of nearly $100 billion last year, buoyed in part by federal coronavirus funds that were signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2021.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Private school enrollment jumps 25 percent in Washington as exodus from public schools continues</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington private schools saw a 25 percent jump in enrollment over the last three years and homeschooling saw a 42 percent increase as public school enrollment continued to fall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the State Board of Education, in 2019-20, there were 65,270 students enrolled in K-12 private schools in the state. By 2022-23, that number had spiked to 81,434 students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the number of students that are homeschooled also increased from 20,844 in 2019-20 to 29,798 in 2022-23.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Liv Finne at the Washington Policy Center, &ldquo;The numbers show that over 110,000 parents in Washington state have decided that enrolling in controversial public schools is not the best option for their children.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nationwide data analysis performed by the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;report card,&rdquo; showed that only 35 percent of Washington's 4th graders are proficient in math with 74 percent testing at a basic level for the 2022-23 school year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers got worse the older the students got with only 28 percent of 8th graders showing proficiency in math and 64 percent showing only a basic knowledge of the material.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis also revealed that students in the Evergreen State lost over five months (-0.65 grade equivalents) of learning in math, while in Washington's largest district Seattle Public Schools, students were down four and a half months of learning (-0.50 grade equivalent).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Governor Jay Inslee, State Superintendent Chris Reykdal, and teachers&rsquo; unions kept public schools shuttered for in-person learning for more than a year in their response to COVID. Public schools did not welcome back students until the fall of 2021 and were regularly closed for &ldquo;outbreaks.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparison, private schools reopened a year earlier in the fall of 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than deal with the learning loss which was already evident just a few months into online learning, in May 2021, Inslee signed SB 5044 to force Critical Race Theory (CRT),&nbsp; including hyper-sexualized gender theory into the classrooms and universities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, many schools have begun removing higher-level learning programs including advanced placement courses for more advanced students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the many reasons parents are pulling their children is violence in the schools after districts like Seattle and Bellevue banned police officers from campuses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington public schools are getting more desperate for enrollment, as student counts are tied to federal dollars, and have been running ads in various markets trying to get students to return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the massive loss of students, some districts including Seattle and Bellevue have already announced that some schools will be closed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for my favorite topic&hellip; sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/07/31/report-canadian-non-binary-rugby-player-accused-of-injuring-women-was-named-hardest-hitter-on-mens-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2023/07/31/report-canadian-non-binary-rugby-player-accused-of-injuring-women-was-named-hardest-hitter-on-mens-team/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Canadian &lsquo;Non-Binary&rsquo; Rugby Player Accused of Injuring Women was Named &lsquo;Hardest Hitter&rsquo; on Men&rsquo;s Team</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A &ldquo;non-binary&rdquo; rugby player accused of injuring women in a match was previously named &ldquo;hardest hitter&rdquo; when serving on the men&rsquo;s team, new evidence shows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last June, the &ldquo;non-binary&rdquo; player was removed from a women&rsquo;s rugby match after he injured three competitors. After the identity of the player remained unknown, it has now been revealed. Per Reduxx:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The identity of the man involved in the incident has now been confirmed as Ash Davis, who previously played in the men&rsquo;s division of the club and had been awarded the &ldquo;hardest hitter&rdquo; designation during the Senior Awards Banquet just last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a source within the rugby club, there has been &lsquo;much opposition&rsquo; to Davis&rsquo; participation in the women&rsquo;s category, but club members are concerned about speaking up out of &ldquo;fear of being labeled transphobic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The source also explained that &lsquo;many people have known Ash for years, making it more sensitive.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marshi Smith, the co-founder of the Independent Council on Women&rsquo;s Sports (ICONS), told Reduxx that the rugby club did not care about the safety of the women players.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;Young women are being forced to jeopardize their physical safety to satisfy the desires of a man, Ash Davis, in Canadian rugby,&rdquo; Smith said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite opposition within the rugby club, leaders like club President Jane Kirby are willing to risk the health and safety of young female players, prioritizing men&rsquo;s preferences over ethical concerns and the potential for life-threatening injuries or death. This policy of sacrificing girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s well-being for men&rsquo;s eligibility preferences is unethical and perilous,&rdquo; Smith added.</span></p>
