<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dehumanizing! MSNBC's Jen Psaki Compares Unborn Babies to Broccoli, Lumps of Coal</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday&rsquo;s edition of Inside with Jen Psaki, the former Biden press secretary mocked a Republican strategy session where pollsters suggested the term &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t helping the GOP, so they suggested the term &ldquo;pro-baby&rdquo; instead. This spurred Psaki to compare babies to....broccoli and a lump of coal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to think it&rsquo;s terribly dehumanizing to call a biological male &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;his.&rdquo; Apparently, comparing a baby to broccoli and lumps of coal is good, swaggering comedy. Democrats have suggested abortion is about a "choice," not a child. The act of abortion is far more dehumanizing than language.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The branding isn&rsquo;t the problem here! The policy is the problem, it is hard to roll out an effective rebrand for a product that customers hate.&rdquo; &hellip; you heard that right.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The "product" is saving babies from the Planned Parenthood slaughterhouse. Democrats get piles of money and logistical support from the slaughterhouse operators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psaki was touting an NBCNews.com story which underlined Psaki was doing the usual DNC messaging. The headline was "Democrats say Republican effort to rebrand 'pro-life' won't persuade voters." This story, based on anonymous Senate Republicans, contained all the Democrat arguments that Psaki made in this segment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-confirms-more-than-100b-in-taxpayer-resources-spent-on-ukraine"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-confirms-more-than-100b-in-taxpayer-resources-spent-on-ukraine</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>White House confirms more than $100B spent on Ukraine war</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House confirmed the Biden administration has spent more than $100 billion on the war in Ukraine, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information came as a response from the White House&rsquo;s Office of Management and Budget to Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio and more than 30 Senate Republicans who demanded in January a "full crosscutting" report on security assistance provided to Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Digital obtained the OMB letter and spreadsheet responding to Vance more than 7 months later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMB Director Shalanda Young penned a letter to Vance explaining the security assistance the United States has provided to Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"With bipartisan Congressional support, the United States has provided security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as it continues to fight to defend its sovereignty following Russia&rsquo;s brutal invasion," Young wrote. "This support has been critical to Ukraine&rsquo;s success on the battlefield, as well as the ability of its people to endure under harsh conditions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young stressed that President Biden "has made clear" that the United States "will not waver in our commitment to the Ukrainian people as they fight for their freedom and independence."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young told Vance that Biden administration officials "agree that transparency and accountability are paramount to ensuring American taxpayers can be confident in their assistance in helping the Ukrainians fight for their country against Russia&rsquo;s aggression."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young provided Vance a "table that details supplemental funding provided in support of Ukraine in addition to current obligation levels, which OMB shared with Congress" in August.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table shows that a total of $101,198,000,000 has been obligated/executed by the Office of Management and Budget.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the $101.2 billion already spent, the spreadsheet appears to outline plans to spend an additional $9.8 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table breaks down the spending from the Department of Defense; Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative; State Department; and other federal agencies providing aid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the Pentagon requested an additional $6 billion due to an accounting error at the Department of Defense. Vance and Sen. Josh Hawley introduced legislation soon after to prevent such mistakes from being repeated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the more than $100 billion already spent in Ukraine, the White House last month asked Congress to authorize an additional $24 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden's request comprises $13 billion for defense and $11 billion for economic and humanitarian aid in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Whistleblower says CIA officials were paid to change view that COVID originated in Wuhan lab</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most officers on the CIA's COVID Discovery Team concluded that the coronavirus originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, but they changed their positions after receiving a monetary incentive, a senior-level CIA agent told Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whistleblower informed Coronavirus Pandemic Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Brad Wenstrup and Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Turner that at the end of the CIA's COVID review, "six of the seven members of the Team believed the intelligence and science were sufficient to make a low confidence assessment that COVID-19 originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China," the Ohio Republicans wrote in a letter Tuesday to CIA Director William Burns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team's seventh member, who was the most senior person, was the only person to believe that the virus originated from an animal, the lawmakers also said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The whistleblower further contends that to come to the eventual public determination of uncertainty, the other six members were given a significant monetary incentive to change their position," the chairmen wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegations, which stemmed from a "seemingly credible source" require Congress to investigate how the CIA handled its investigation of COVID's origins, according to the lawmakers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republicans are demanding the CIA hand over information to their committees as part of their probe, and they threatened to use "additional tools and authorities to satisfy our legislative and oversight requirements" if the agency does not comply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.usni.org/2023/09/09/u-s-canadian-warships-transit-taiwan-strait-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://news.usni.org/2023/09/09/u-s-canadian-warships-transit-taiwan-strait-2</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>U.S., Canadian Warships Transit Taiwan Strait</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An American guided-missile destroyer and a Royal Canadian Navy frigate sailed through the Taiwan Strait in a tandem Saturday transit, U.S. 7th Fleet announced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japan-based USS Ralph Johnson and HMCS Ottawa passed through the strait after drilling with Japanese ships in the East China Sea, near Okinawa, USNI News reported on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The ships transited through a corridor in the strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state,&rdquo; reads the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Ralph Johnson and Ottawa&rsquo;s bilateral transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the commitment of the United States and our allies and partners to a free and open Indo-Pacific.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an exercise earlier this week, Ralph Johnson and Ottawa sailed with big deck helicopter carrier JS Izumo and destroyer JS Samidare as part of the trilateral exercise Noble Stingray that included anti-submarine warfare drills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation crew aboard Ottawa took footage of a People&rsquo;s Liberation Army Navy guided-missile destroyer shadowing the formation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The heavily armed Chinese destroyer, the Luyang, closely followed the convoy of ships in the East China Sea, calling out repeatedly to the Canadians on maritime radio, and coming within just over a kilometer of the allied ships,&rdquo; reads the CBC report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s unclear if Hohhot followed Ralph Johnson and Ottawa during their transit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last reported U.S. surface ship transit was by U.S. Coast Guard cutter Stratton in June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And lastly a little plug for myself! I&rsquo;ve launched a podcast about my favorite topic, sports! It&rsquo;s called Game Time with Garrison &amp; Garrett&hellip; you can find us on Apple Podcasts, Itunes, Spotify, and Google podcasts! If you&rsquo;d give it a listen, I&rsquo;d greatly appreciate you.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[Daily News Brief for Tuesday, September 12th, 2023 [Daily News Brief]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Tuesday, September 12th, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fight Laugh Feast Conference - Ark Encounter</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This year, our Fight Laugh Feast Conference is at the Ark Encounter in Kentucky on The Politics of Six Day Creation. The politics of six day creation is the difference between a fixed standard of justice and a careening standard of justice, the difference between the corrosive relativism that creates mobs and anarchy and the freedom of objectivity, truth, and due process. The politics of six day creation establishes the authority and sufficiency of God&rsquo;s Word for all of life: from what is a man or a woman, when does human life begin, and how is human society best organized?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Come hear Ken Ham, Pastor Doug Wilson, Dr. Ben Merkle, Dr. Gordon Wilson, me and more, and of course a live CrossPolitic show! Mark your calendars for October 11th-14th, as we fight, laugh, and feast, with beer &amp; psalms, our amazing lineup of speakers, our Rowdy Christian Merch, and a Sabbath Feast to wrap up the occasion. Maybe an infant baptism while we&rsquo;re at it! Visit fightlaughfeast.com for more information!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/09/10/estimated-300000-impacted-by-earthquake-in-morocco-with-at-least-2000-dead/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/09/10/estimated-300000-impacted-by-earthquake-in-morocco-with-at-least-2000-dead/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Estimated 300,000 Impacted by Earthquake in Morocco, with at Least 2,000 Dead</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A magnitude 3.9 aftershock rattled Moroccans on Sunday as they prayed for victims of the nation&rsquo;s strongest earthquake in more than a century and worked to rescue survivors while soldiers and workers brought water and supplies to mountain villages in ruins. More than 2,000 people are dead &ndash; a number that is expected to rise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The United Nations estimated that 300,000 people were affected by Friday night&rsquo;s magnitude 6.8 quake and some Moroccans complained on social networks that the government wasn&rsquo;t allowing more help from outside. International aid crews were prepared to deploy, but remained in limbo waiting for the Morocco government to request their assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We know there is a great urgency to save people and dig under the remains of buildings,&rdquo; said the, founder of Rescuers Without Borders, who had a team stuck in Paris waiting for the green light. &ldquo;There are people dying under the rubble, and we cannot do anything to save them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Those left homeless &ndash; or fearing more aftershocks &ndash; from Friday night&rsquo;s earthquake slept outside Saturday, in the streets of the ancient city of Marrakech or under makeshift canopies in Atlas Mountain towns like Moulay Brahim, which were among the hardest-hit. The worst destruction was in small, rural communities that are hard for rescuers to reach because of the mountainous terrain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Those same areas were shaken anew Sunday by a magnitude 3.9 quake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear if the temblor caused more damage or casualties, but it was likely strong enough to rattle nerves in areas where damage has left buildings unstable and people have spoken of their fears of aftershocks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The earthquake on Friday toppled buildings not built to withstand such a mighty quake, trapping people in the rubble and sending others fleeing in terror. A total of 2,012 people were confirmed dead and at least 2,059 more people were injured &ndash; 1,404 of them critically &ndash; Morocco&rsquo;s Interior Ministry reported Saturday night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Flags were lowered across Morocco, as King Mohammed VI ordered three days of national mourning starting Sunday. The army mobilized specialized search and rescue teams, and the king ordered water, food rations and shelter to be provided to those who lost their homes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Aid offers have poured in from around the world and the U.N. said it had a team in Morocco coordinating with authorities about how international partners can provide support. About 100 teams made up of a total of 3,500 rescuers from around the world are registered with a U.N. platform and ready to deploy in Morocco when asked, Rescuers Without Borders said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a sign that Morocco may be prepared to accept more help from outside, the Spanish military said it had sent an air force plane carrying an urban search and rescue team of 56 soldiers and four dogs to Marrakech to help. Foreign Minister Jos&eacute; Manuel Albares said in a radio interview that the deployment was in response to a bilateral request for help from Moroccan authorities. Another rescue team from Nice, France, also was on its way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In France, home to many people with links to Morocco, towns and cities have offered more than 2 million euros ($2.1 million) in aid, and popular performers are rallying to collect donations. The Moroccan king ordered the opening of special bank accounts to allow donations to help those in need.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66771568"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66771568</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Kim Jong Un: North Korea leader's armoured train reportedly heading to meet Putin</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The armoured train that Mr Kim uses for foreign visits appears to have departed Pyongyang, South Korean media reported citing a government official.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The meeting between the two leaders is expected to take place as early as Tuesday local time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Kremlin has confirmed that Mr Kim will visit Russia "in the coming days".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Pentagon said it believes Mr Kim is travelling to Russia and it expects "some type of meeting", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">If the summit with Mr Putin goes ahead, it will be the North Korean leader's first international trip in more than four years, and the first since the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The two leaders will likely discuss the possibility of North Korea providing Moscow with weapons to support its war in Ukraine, a US official earlier told CBS, the BBC's US partner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mr Kim's last trip abroad was also to Vladivostok in 2019 for his first summit with Mr Putin after the collapse of North Korea's nuclear disarmament talks with then US President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It is rumoured to include at least 20 bulletproof cars, making it heavier than average trains and unable to go beyond 59 km/h (37mph). His journey to Vladivostok is expected to take an entire day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The possible meeting comes after the White House said it had new information that arms negotiations between the two countries were "actively advancing".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">National Security Council spokesman John Kirby earlier said Russia's Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, had tried to "convince Pyongyang to sell artillery ammunition" to Russia during a recent visit to North Korea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The summit comes at a time when both Russia and North Korea have things that the other country wants, according to Ankit Panda from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"What'll matter now is if both sides can find suitable prices they're willing to pay for the other's assistance," he told the BBC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russia will likely ask North Korea for conventional arms, including artillery shells and rocket artillery munitions in exchange for food and raw materials, and continuing support at international forums like the United Nations, he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"This could open up the possibility of North Korea transferring more sophisticated weaponry to Russia to allow Moscow to maintain and backfill its own stocks of conventional weapons," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It is thought that Russia might need 122mm and 152mm shells because its stocks are running low, but it is not easy to determine North Korea's full artillery inventory, given its secretive nature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Weapons on display at the meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Shoigu in July included the Hwasong intercontinental ballistic missile, believed to be the country's first ICBM to use solid propellants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">It was the first time Mr Kim had opened the country's doors to foreign guests since the Covid pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/police-budget-cut-in-nyc-as-illegal-immigrant-crisis-forces-women-children-to-sleep-in-tents?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/police-budget-cut-in-nyc-as-illegal-immigrant-crisis-forces-women-children-to-sleep-in-tents?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Police budget cut in NYC as illegal immigrant crisis forces women, children to sleep in tents</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">On Saturday, city officials announced that the New York Police Department's budget would be cut, with that money re-allocated to solving the migrant crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The move comes as New York City continues to deal with rampant crime and an unprecedented influx of illegal immigrants, many of whom, including women and children, may soon be forced out of shelters and into tents on the street.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Budget Director Jacques Jiha revealed in a memo over the weekend explaining that Mayor Eric Adams, who recently said the migrant crisis could "destroy" the city, will soon "issue a directive to implement an overtime reduction initiative for our city's four uniformed agencies."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">These include the NYPD, the fire department, the corrections department, and the department of sanitation, all of whom provide vital services to the city and its residents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Jiha also asked the agencies to "track overtime spending and their progress in meeting the reduction target," and submit monthly reports to the city.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The head of the Police Benevolent Association, Patrick Hendry, slammed the move as out of touch with reality.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"It is going to be impossible for the NYPD to significantly reduce overtime unless it fixes its staffing crisis," he said. "We are still thousands of cops short, and we're struggling to drive crime back to pre-2020 levels without adequate personnel."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As the Daily Mail reports, New York City is currently spending close to $10 million per day dealing with the surge of migrants, with no end to the crisis in sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The massive cuts to the budgets of essential city services will only cover two-thirds of the projected costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As more migrants arrive, shelters and other facilities have reached their breaking point. During an interview with PIX11 on Sunday, Adams said that those who had been given priority for indoor sleeping areas could lose that privilege.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fauci-federal-recommendations-possible-not-mandates-uptick-covid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fauci-federal-recommendations-possible-not-mandates-uptick-covid</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Fauci says federal mask 'recommendations' are possible amid uptick in COVID</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci predicted Sunday that federal recommendations for masking may be given as COVID-19 cases continue to rise, but not federal mandates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In an appearance on ABC's This Week, Fauci told Jon Karl he would be "extremely surprised" if a federal mask mandate were put in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I can see that if we get a significant uptick in cases that you may see the recommendation that masks be used under certain circumstances and indoor crowded settings, but I don't see there'd be certainly not federal mandates," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"There may be local organizations that may require masks, but I think what we're gonna see mostly are, if the cases go up that there might be recommendations, not mandates. There's a big difference there," Fauci continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Karl also pressed the former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director at the National Institutes of Health on the efficacy of masking in retrospect. Asked about new studies indicating that the practice of masking may not have been effective in containing the COVID-19 virus, Fauci claimed some studies are being misconstrued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/michigan-state-suspends-mel-tucker-without-pay-sexual-harassment-allegations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/sports/michigan-state-suspends-mel-tucker-without-pay-sexual-harassment-allegations</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Michigan State suspends Mel Tucker without pay amid sexual harassment allegations</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michigan State suspended football coach Mel Tucker Sunday amid an investigation after he was accused of sexually harassing a rape survivor last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michigan State athletic director Alan Haller made the announcement following conflicting reports Tucker was going to be fired and/or suspended. He added that Tucker was suspended without pay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tucker has been the head coach of the Spartans since 2020 and signed a 10-year, $95 million contract extension in November 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The allegations against Tucker surfaced earlier in the day in a USA Today report. According to ESPN, he was under investigation over the allegations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Michigan State secondary coach Harlon Barnett will serve as the interim head coach. Former coach Mark Dantonio is returning as an associate head coach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Brenda Tracy, a sexual assault prevention advocate who was gang raped by four college football players in 1998, filed the complaint against Tucker and alleged the coach had asked whether she would date him if he weren&rsquo;t already married and gratified himself without her consent during a phone call, according to USA Today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tucker claims all of this was consensual - stating: "Ms. Tracy&rsquo;s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me," Tucker wrote to the Title IX investigator in March, according to USA Today.

   <title><![CDATA[Is STEM Beautiful? An Interview with Mitch Stokes [The Pugcast]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Since C. P. Snow's landmark book, The Two Cultures intellectuals have wondered whether or not it is possible to bridge the divide between the sciences (or STEM), and the humanities. Another way of putting it is, "What's the connection between facts and values?" Today on the Pugcast the guys welcome philosopher and engineer, Mitch Stokes of New Saint Andrews College. Mitch was recently awarded a grant to explore this very question. And Mitch's intriguing thesis is beauty is the bridge. Join us for a free-flowing conversation!</p>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Because the sons of Issachar had an &ldquo;understanding of the times,&rdquo; they knew what Israel should do. But do the people who lead us in politics and in law, even the Christians, really understand the times, what historian Carl Becker called the &ldquo;climate of opinion&rdquo; that determines whether any argument&mdash;for law or otherwise&mdash;can even make sense? Today David uses Becker and the Scriptures to help us understand the times and whether our leaders understand them.</p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Health Insurance Costs Projected To Have Highest Increase In Over a Decade</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employer health insurance costs are expected to increase significantly in 2024, affecting both workers and businesses as hospital operating costs rise, according to data reported by The Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, the costs for health insurance coverage from employers are expected to increase by around 6.5%, which could be the biggest increase in more than a decade, according to survey data acquired by the WSJ. Driving the increase in health insurance costs are inflated labor costs for hospitals and a large demand for expensive new diabetes and obesity drugs, which are being passed down to insurance companies in new contracts with the hospitals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals who do not receive insurance from their employer but rather through the Affordable Care Act will see their premium costs rise by about 6% next year, which is comparable to the increase this year, according to the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1696593061545906458"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1696593061545906458</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well at least Joe Biden feels your pain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers are likely to pay more out of pocket as employers shift some of the cost of inflation down to employees, according to the WSJ. Despite the shift, a tight labor market may push employers to shoulder a bigger share as hiring and retaining workers remain competitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unemployment ticked up in August but remained relatively low at 3.8%, up from 3.5% in July. The U.S. added 187,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in a sign of a slowing job market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, the Biden administration released a list of ten drugs that Medicare will negotiate prices with drug manufacturers over in an effort to reduce costs. The negotiations are set to begin later in 2023 but will not go into effect until 2026, with companies being threatened with up to a 95% tax if they do not cooperate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://hotair.com/david-strom/2023/09/06/uk-you-may-soon-go-to-jail-if-you-dont-upgrade-your-energy-efficiency-n576157#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/david-strom/2023/09/06/uk-you-may-soon-go-to-jail-if-you-dont-upgrade-your-energy-efficiency-n576157#google_vignette</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UK: you may soon go to jail if you don't upgrade your energy efficiency</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the Industrial Revolution began in the UK.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the mastery of energy&ndash;replacing muscle power with fossil fuels that fundamentally transformed everything. We still describe an engine&rsquo;s output as &ldquo;horsepower&rdquo; for a reason: for most of human history the fastest anything could travel was the speed of a horse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless, of course, you were falling off a cliff. Then you could go faster, but the ride was short.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK&ndash;which is still led by the Tories only because Labour is even worse&ndash;is looking to undo the Industrial Revolution. In a ridiculous bid to save Gaia from an imagined threat, the government is proposing to create new criminal laws that would imprison and fine people for not complying with new energy efficiency standards. Soon they will make excessive energy use&ndash;and that will be energy use that rises above &ldquo;Net Zero&rdquo;&ndash;could be a criminal offense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I am not kidding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property owners who fail to comply with new energy efficiency rules could face prison under government plans that have sparked a backlash from Tory MPs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ministers want to grant themselves powers to create new criminal offences and increase civil penalties as part of efforts to hit net zero targets. Under the proposals, people who fall foul of regulations to reduce their energy consumption could face up to a year in prison and fines of up to &pound;15,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tory backbenchers are set to rebel against the plans, which they fear would lead to the criminalisation of homeowners, landlords and businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals are contained in the Government&rsquo;s controversial Energy Bill, which is set to come before the Commons for the first time when MPs return from their summer break on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides for &ldquo;the creation of criminal offences&rdquo; where there is &ldquo;non-compliance with a requirement imposed by or under energy performance regulations&rdquo;. People could also be prosecuted for &ldquo;provision of false information&rdquo; about energy efficiency or the &ldquo;obstruction of&hellip; an enforcement authority&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking in on the Hollywood Strike&hellip;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/09/06/report-striking-hollywood-workers-facing-evictions-some-living-in-their-cars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2023/09/06/report-striking-hollywood-workers-facing-evictions-some-living-in-their-cars/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Striking Hollywood Workers Facing Evictions, Some Living in Their Cars</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the dual Hollywood strikes drag on with no end in sight, writers and actors are increasingly finding themselves in dire financial straits, with a growing number of striking workers reportedly facing evictions as they can no longer afford to pay rent. In certain cases, some have resorted to living in their cars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several charitable organizations that have been supporting striking Hollywood workers with grants said they are seeing housing difficulties impact actors and writers as well as blue-collar crew members, according to an account from The Hollywood Reporter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of crew members ranging from lighting personnel to makeup artists have been forced into long-term unemployment due to the strikes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many non-celebrity actors, the strikes have been financially ruinous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The strike has had a massive impact on my housing situation. I worked one day in May, and since then all the work has stopped,&rdquo; actor David Baach told The Hollywood Reporter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve almost depleted my entire savings, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to pay my rent the last few months. My building manager and property owners extended me a grace period due to the good social credit I had built up by doing some gardening and landscaping in our building&rsquo;s common area. However, in early August, I received an eviction notice from the building&rsquo;s management company taped to my front door.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders of two Hollywood charities &mdash; the Entertainment Community Fund and the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund&nbsp; &mdash; told the magazine that people are losing their homes due to the strikes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;People are becoming unhoused, they&rsquo;re being evicted from their apartments and they&rsquo;re not paying their mortgages so eventually they will lose their homes as well. We&rsquo;re talking to people who are living in their cars, in some cases with their families,&rdquo; MPTF president and CEO Bob Beitcher reportedly said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MPTF is giving away $1,500 grants to striking workers but the amount doesn&rsquo;t come close to covering monthly rent in a city as expensive as Los Angeles and its surroundings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actors&rsquo; and writers&rsquo; strikes against Hollywood studios show no signs of ending as the warring sides continue to dig in their heels on key negotiating points regarding streaming compensation and A.I.&nbsp; has brought TV and movie production to a virtual halt around the country, putting thousands of people out of work and damaging local economies coast to coast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/sound-of-freedom-number-1-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/sound-of-freedom-number-1-latin-america/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Sound of Freedom&rsquo; Nabs No. 1 Slot in 18 Latin American Countries</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sound of Freedom&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t done quite yet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The summer&rsquo;s indie sensation finally fell out of the top 10 box office results after earning north of $180 million at the U.S. box office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those numbers are staggering and would be the summer&rsquo;s biggest story if not for a certain one-two punch dubbed &ldquo;Barbenheimer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Freedom,&rdquo; which follows a Homeland Security agent (Jim Caviezel) tracking down a little girl abducted by sex traffickers, is now a global sensation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film scored 18 number-one slots across Latin America over the weekend, according to Angel Studios.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexico</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guatemala</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honduras</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Salvador</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicaragua</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costa Rica</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panama</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colombia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venezuela</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecuador</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peru</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolivia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belize</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paraguay</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chile</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uruguay</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argentina</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominican Republic</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film also performed respectively in other nations during its opening weekend:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1 in New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 in Australia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 in South Africa</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4 in the United Kingdom</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney infamously acquired the film during its 2019 takeover of 20th Century Fox but didn&rsquo;t know what to do with the property. So the Mouse House shelved it for five years before Angel Studios bought the rights to the film and released it independently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mainstream media savaged the film in cruel and unprofessional ways. Reporters attacked Caviezel for his political views and suggested the film addressed an issue that&rsquo;s based on conspiracy theory more than fact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most absurd line of attack?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some outlets used one of the 6,000+ people who crowdfunded the movie&rsquo;s marketing efforts against the project. The person in question is tied up in a child custody dispute framed as &ldquo;child abduction.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film&rsquo;s global revenue is still dramatically lower than its domestic haul. So far, &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo; has earned more than $2 million outside the U.S.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. federal deficit is projected to nearly double this year as a result of higher interest rates and lower tax revenue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gap between what the government spends and what it collects is expected to grow from about $1 trillion last year to $2 trillion for the 2023 fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, according to the latest projections from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonpartisan group that advocates for reducing the federal deficit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This would be the highest deficit we&rsquo;ve ever had outside of a recession or national emergency," Marc Goldwein, a senior policy director at CRFB, told FOX Business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sizable increase stems from a number of factors, including high inflation, more expensive interest payments and a drop in tax receipts. It comes on the heels of a record drop in the budget shortfall last year, as the deficit dropped from close to $3 trillion to roughly $1 trillion after the government's record spending during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the government enjoyed a surge in capital gains revenue after Americans capitalized on the booming market the previous year, sold more stock and recorded large gains. The market has not fared as well since then, leading to a sharp drop in capital gains tax revenue compared with last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treasury Department likewise benefited from a spike in general tax collection, because surging inflation essentially pushed up nominal income for millions of households. Although the IRS indexes the tax code to inflation, it does so on a lag. Higher federal income tax brackets and standard deductions took effect at the beginning of 2023, essentially allowing more Americans to shield their income from the IRS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security and Medicare are also indexed to inflation, meaning the government is spending more money on those programs than it did in fiscal year 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"But mostly what&rsquo;s happening is it&rsquo;s coming to the new normal, from an unusually low 2022 deficit," Goldwein said. "That&rsquo;s pretty scary, because normal before the pandemic was $1 trillion. And in 2015, it was $500 billion. So we went from $500 billion is the normal, to $1 trillion is the normal, to $2 trillion is the normal in less than a decade."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figures exclude President Biden's $400 billion student loan cancellation plan, which was counted in the official 2022 deficit numbers but never implemented because the Supreme Court struck the policy down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such massive spending imbalances highlight the toll that high and rising debt can take on everyday Americans. High deficits can fuel inflation, and high debt can push up interest rates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mortgage rates are as high as they&rsquo;ve been since well before the financial crisis," Goldwein said. "Car loan rates, student loan rates, credit card rates, they&rsquo;re all really high."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deficit surge comes as lawmakers rush to avert a government shutdown. The White House has urged Congress to pass a short-term funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, in order to keep the government solvent while lawmakers continue negotiations over longer-term funding bills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., have both said they want to pass a short-term deal to keep the government running.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a group of House Republicans &mdash; the House Freedom Caucus &mdash; is demanding a number of concessions as part of the continuing resolution, raising the risk of more down-to-the-wire drama on Capitol Hill.</span></p>

<p><strong>Biden to wear mask indoors after COVID-19 exposure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden will don a mask indoors after he was exposed to COVID-19 through his wife, first lady Jill Biden, according to the White House.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1699269260260823345"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1699269260260823345</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Studies have repeatedly shown masks don't prevent Covid transmission and might even have health consequences to wearers. - But I digress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, who awarded the Medal of Honor to Army Capt. Larry Taylor for conspicuous gallantry on Tuesday, is expected to depart Thursday for India and the Group of 20 leaders summit. During the Medal of Honor ceremony, Biden took off his mask for his remarks and did not put it back on to hang the trinket around Taylor's neck or to leave the East Room.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National security adviser Jake Sullivan downplayed the prospect that a presidential COVID-19 diagnosis would disrupt his foreign trip based on leaders' past experience social distancing during the pandemic.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>75,000 illegal immigrants flagged as having possible ties to terrorism in the last year, according to CBP data</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Customs and Border Protection flagged approximately 75,000 illegal immigrants as being possible national security threats or having terroristic ties in the previous 10 months leading up to August 2023, the Daily Caller reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBP data showed that between October 2022 and August 2023, 74,904 illegal aliens were labeled as "SIA Encounters," which stands for "Special Interest Alien."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Department of Homeland Security article, an SIA is a "non-U.S. person" who potentially "poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Often such individuals or groups are employing travel patterns known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism. DHS analysis includes an examination of travel patterns, points of origin, and/or travel segments that are tied to current assessments of national and international threat environments," the DHS stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This does not mean that all SIAs are 'terrorists,'" the government report added. However, the travel and behavior of certain individuals "indicates a possible nexus to nefarious activity (including terrorism) and, at a minimum, provides indicators that necessitate heightened screening and further investigation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unearthed numbers were a massive increase from the reported 25,627 special interest encounters from fiscal year 2022, and the comparably miniscule 3,675 from fiscal year 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal immigrants can automatically be deemed SIAs based on their country of origin, such as Turkey or Uzbekistan, due to such countries' status as a "source and transit country."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS didn&rsquo;t respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller regarding the SIA figures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBP and the DHS are under heightened scrutiny as a result of the shocking increase in border crossing encounters under the Biden administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former immigration judge claimed in late August 2023 that the DHS was deliberately not disclosing the number of illegal immigrants who have been released into the United States each month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The only reason why ICE and OFO [Office of Field Operations] would refuse to disclose that information is to hide the fact that it is releasing more than 100,000 aliens per month into the United States and to conceal the effects of those migrant releases on communities across the United States," Andrew Arthur said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Border encounters in fiscal year 2023 are on pace to match the near 2.4 million that were seen in 2022. There were just over 1.7 million encounters in 2021, while in 2020, President Trump's administration saw a little more than 450,000.</span></p>

<p><strong>Electric Vehicles Are Causing Issues After Hurricane Idalia</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicles are catching on fire after Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to local reports, at least two Tesla EVs ignited after saltwater from the storm surge damaged their batteries and other electrical components. One vehicle lit up in Pinellas Park and another car fire occurred in Palm Harbor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Carfax says owners need to understand the fire risk doesn&rsquo;t go away after their EV dries out,&rdquo; ABC Actions News told viewers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The salt water that is flooding can get into the battery and dry there and once it dries it creates what federal safety officials call bridges between cells and that can lead to fires and those fires can come anywhere from days to weeks later and once an EV catches fire it is incredible difficult to put it out,&rdquo; said Patrick Olsen of Carfax.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hurricane Ian, 21 electric vehicles caught fire in the state, prompting officials to warn residents ahead of Idalia's approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We saw a number of fires associated with EVs from Hurricane Ian. We know that the saltwater from storm surge can compromise these batteries, causing fires which cannot be easily suppressed,&rdquo; Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said at the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The best fire teams can do is keep water on the battery until the fuel burns out. If you&rsquo;re evacuating and leaving an EV, or other lithium ion powered devices like scooters or golf carts in your garage, you&rsquo;re creating a real fire threat for your home, your communities, and first responders," he added. "Take this threat seriously. If there&rsquo;s even a small risk of your EV being impacted by storm surge, move it to higher ground before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One home that managed to survive Ian ended up burning to the ground because of a saltwater-damaged EV.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV vehicle owners are being advised to park affected cars at least 50 feet away from any structures that could catch fire.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Putin Won't Renew Grain Deal Until the West Meets His Demands</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that a landmark deal allowing Ukraine to export grain safely through the Black Sea amid the war won&rsquo;t be restored until the West meets Moscow's demands on its own agricultural exports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed the Kremlin&rsquo;s demands as a ploy to advance its own interests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Still, Putin's remarks dashed hopes that his talks with the Turkish President could revive an agreement seen as vital for global food supplies, especially in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russia refused to extend the deal in July, complaining that a parallel agreement promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertilizer hadn&rsquo;t been honored. It said restrictions on shipping and insurance hampered its agricultural trade, though it has shipped record amounts of wheat since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Putin reiterated those complaints Monday, while also telling reporters that if those commitments were honored, Russia could return to the deal &ldquo;within days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Turkish President also expressed hope that a breakthrough could come soon. He said Turkey and the U.N. &mdash; which both brokered the original deal &mdash; have put together a new package of proposals to unblock the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I believe that we will reach a solution that will meet the expectations in a short time,&rdquo; Erdogan said at the news conference held with Putin in the Russian resort of Sochi.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Earlier, a German Foreign Minister lashed out, saying Putin's &ldquo;game with the grain agreement is cynical.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A lot is riding on the negotiation. Ukraine and Russia are major suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other goods that developing nations rely on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Data from the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, which organized shipments under the deal, show that 57% of the grain from Ukraine went to developing nations, with the top destination being China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Grain prices shot up after Russia pulled out of the deal but have since fallen back, indicating that there isn't a big crunch in the market for the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But failure to revive the agreement will have &ldquo;drastic impacts&rdquo; in countries such as Somalia and Egypt that rely heavily on Black Sea grain, according to Galip Dalay, an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russia may be hoping it can use its power over Ukraine&rsquo;s Black Sea exports as a bargaining chip to reduce Western economic sanctions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/04/university-michigan-students-hotel-rooms-covid-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/04/university-michigan-students-hotel-rooms-covid-19/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Major University will Kick Students out of Dorms if they Gev Covid-19</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The University of Michigan (UM) is asking students who test positive for COVID-19 to get a hotel room in order to quarantine for five days, according to the university&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The university reminded students on Sept. 1 of the school&rsquo;s rules surrounding COVID-19, suggesting if they are sick stay home, wear masks and get tested, according to the website. The university also asked students to create an &ldquo;isolation plan&rdquo; in case they contract COVID-19, noting that no students are allowed in the residence halls if they test positive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This could include relocating to your permanent residence, staying with a nearby relative or friend, or finding a hotel space. Students in Michigan Housing must leave their residence halls during isolation, even if they are in a single room,&rdquo; the website reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The UM Department of Environment, Health &amp; Safety (EHS) is supposed to get in touch with the students within 24 hours to discuss the &ldquo;care and isolation options,&rdquo; according to the website. If a student must pay for a hotel room, the university did not clarify on the website whether or not they will compensate the student.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Oil prices settle at 10-month high as Saudi, Russia extend supply cuts</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Oil prices rose a dollar a barrel on Tuesday to their highest since November, after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year, worrying investors about potential shortages during peak winter demand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Brent crude futures rose by $1.04, or 1.2%, to settle at $90.04 a barrel, closing above the $90 mark for the first time since November 16, 2022. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October futures gained $1.14, or 1.3%, to settle at $86.69 a barrel, also a 10-month high.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Investors had expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend voluntary cuts into October, but the three-month extension was unexpected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would review the supply cuts monthly, and could modify them depending on market conditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;With the production cut extended, we anticipate a market deficit of more than 1.5 million barrels per day in 4Q23,&rdquo; UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo wrote in a note to clients. UBS now expects Brent crude to rise to $95 a barrel by year-end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Reflecting concerns about the short-term market supply, front month Brent and WTI contracts were also trading at their steepest premium since November to later-dated prices. This structure, called backwardation, indicates tightening supply for prompt deliveries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also supporting oil prices on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it now sees the probability of a U.S. recession starting in the next 12 months at 15%, down from an earlier forecast of 20%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Along with the Saudi supply cuts, which began in July, prospects of the U.S. economy avoiding a hard recession have helped lift oil demand and prices in recent months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both Brent and WTI futures have gained more than 20% since the end of June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In other news&hellip; have you guys been noticing Mcconell lately and his freezing episodes?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/mcconnell-physician-says-no-evidence-seizures-stroke-second-freezing-episode"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/mcconnell-physician-says-no-evidence-seizures-stroke-second-freezing-episode</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>McConnell physician says &lsquo;no evidence&rsquo; of seizures or stroke after second freezing episode</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The attending physician of the Capitol is ruling out a seizure, stroke, or other movement disorder after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) had difficulty speaking during a press conference in Kentucky last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;My examination of you following your August 30, 2023 brief episode included several medical evaluations: brain MRI imaging, EEG study and consultations with several neurologists for a comprehensive neurology assessment,&rdquo; Dr. Brian P. Monahan said in a new letter released by McConnell's office. &ldquo;There is no evidence that you have a seizure disorder or that you experienced a stroke, TIA or movement disorder such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The incident occurred last Wednesday when a reporter in Covington, Kentucky, asked him about his political plans when his term is up in 2026.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At first, the Senate Republican leader acknowledged the question but trailed off and stopped speaking. An aide stepped in and asked if he had heard the question. McConnell responded "yes" but continued to freeze. This prompted the aide to say, "We're going to need a minute."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The senator appeared to regain his composure and then briefly answered two additional questions after aides stepped in to repeat questions from reporters and then led him away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In late July, the minority leader was briefly escorted from the Senate Republicans' weekly press conference after he froze in front of the cameras, the first such public incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">McConnell, 81, was hospitalized earlier this year after suffering a fall that required him to complete physical therapy. He experienced a concussion and a minor rib fracture that sidelined him from the Senate for nearly six weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Monahan last week attributed the most recent freezing episode to dehydration and lightheadedness related to his concussion but said he was "medically clear" to continue his duties as usual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Republican leader's office also had attributed the two freezing moments to &ldquo;lightheadedness."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">McConnell was previously hospitalized in 2019 after fracturing his shoulder from a fall on his patio at home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">McConnell and the rest of the Senate returns to Washington Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor!&nbsp; Welcome to the kitchen table of the Comedian Next Door, hosted by the Fight Laugh Feast Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to solve the Cone Palace Problem.&nbsp; Since this is a community-wide issue with far-reaching consequences, you already know exactly what we're talking about: There's constantly gridlocked traffic at the corner of US31 and Center Road, caused by Kokomo's inexplicable craving for mediocre icecream from 4:00pm to 9:00pm DAILY... It's awful. Let's whine about it.</p>
<p>Next, celebrate Luke's special accomplishment with us!</p>
<p>Later... People have no idea how to stay married the "lust phase."&nbsp; Let's dissect a meme that often gets shared by Divorced People to justify their 3rd or 4th or 5th new relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact the Comedian Next Door by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>. We'll see you at the Conference in October! (Details at flfnetwork.com)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>America Last: Biden Admin Pledges Mass Campaign To Give Work Permits To Migrants</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration committed to working with the state of New York on Wednesday to help fill job vacancies with migrants who are straining the city&rsquo;s social safety net, according to a press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul asked the Biden administration on Aug. 24 to expedite work permits for immigrants who are flooding New York City, provide more funds to build shelters and reimburse the state for the cost of deploying National Guard troops in response to the migrant crisis. Senior Biden administration officials met with Hochul on Wednesday, pledging to launch a campaign that will help migrants within the state apply for employment authorization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;First, following the deployment of a Department of Homeland Security assessment team, the Administration highlighted data indicating that substantial number of recent migrants who arrived in New York City are currently work eligible but have not yet applied to get a work permit,&rdquo; the press release states. &ldquo;For example, nationwide, only around 16% of working-age CBP One entrants have applied for work authorization. To date, roughly 20% of the noncitizens indicating New York, New Jersey or Pennsylvania as their intended destination this year were paroled in following an appointment scheduled through CBP One and are eligible to work immediately, if they apply.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration and the New York state government will use text messages and email beginning in September to provide migrants who are &ldquo;work eligible&rdquo; with information on how to apply for employment authorization, the press release states. New York will also receive support from the federal departments of Health and Human Services, Education, Housing and Urban Development and the Interior to assist with the migrant surge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Republican governors began busing migrants to New York City, the state has had to care for about 100,000 migrants, despite not having enough shelter and resources. The Biden administration was previously apprehensive about allowing Democrat-run cities to grant migrants work permits, fearing that the move could lead to more border crossings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders previously requested that the Biden administration temporarily waive the 180-day required waiting period before migrants can receive work authorization.</span></p>

<p><strong>Parental Rights Win as Mom Settles With School District That 'Transitioned' Daughter Without Consent</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transgender mob has made no bones about exactly what their agenda is, and they are quick to brand anyone who speaks out about it a bigot or a transphobe. Much of their indoctrination is taking place in the nation's public schools. They love to claim that they are just helping kids to be their "true selves" or some such nonsense. But if what they are doing is so great, why don't they feel the need to involve parents, or in many cases, even tell them? One California mom fought back against the trans agenda, and the case could be a landmark victory for the rights of parents of public school children all over the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1696636080924303577"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1696636080924303577</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Konen's 11-year-old daughter, Alicia, is a student in the Spreckels Union School District in Monterey County, California. Alicia was told at school that she might be "upset" because "she didn't know who she 'truly was inside.'" Was she displaying signs of being "upset," such as failing grades or acting out in class? How did the school conclude she was upset about anything? The school then began socially transitioning Alicia's gender. She was allowed to use the boys' restroom and use male pronouns. All of this going on without Konen's knowledge or consent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jessica Konen found out about this, she sued the school district. Konen was represented by the Center for American Liberty and obtained a settlement from the school district for $100,000. Thankfully, Jessica Konen's daughter continues to be her daughter. But Konen says the fight is far from over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the school district settled with Konen, they did not admit any fault. It would have been surprising if they had.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spreckels Union School District is just one of several school districts in liberal Democrat-run California where parents have had enough of being told they have no say in their children's education.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping parents out of the gender loop is a problem that is not going away. Roughly 168 school districts overseeing 5,904 schools around the nation have guidance that prevents parents from knowing if their child identifies as a gender other than their birth gender at school. Faculty and staff cannot disclose this information without the student's permission. These numbers shake out to approximately 3.2 million public school students.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Argentine Presidential Front-Runner Javier Milei: Biden a &lsquo;Threat to Western Values&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argentina&rsquo;s presidential front-runner Javier Milei described socialists as &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; and &ldquo;human excrement&rdquo; during a radio interview, to which Colombia&rsquo;s far-left President Gustavo Petro, a former member of a Marxist guerrilla group, responded Tuesday by comparing Milei to Adolf Hitler.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petro, a former member of the Marxist M19 guerrilla and Colombia&rsquo;s first-ever leftist president, made the outrageous comparison on his Twitter account hours after Colombia&rsquo;s RCN radio published an exclusive interview with Milei on Tuesday. During the interview, Milei suggested socialism was the greatest threat to his country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What is a socialist on the inside? He is garbage, he is human excrement,&rdquo; Milei railed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere in the interview, Milei listed leftist values as &ldquo;envy, hatred, resentment, unequal treatment before the law, theft and murder&rdquo; and branded American President Joe Biden a &ldquo;threat to Western values.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Biden is a left-wing president,&rdquo; Milei said. &ldquo;So it is not surprising that he is also putting the world&rsquo;s leading power in check. Biden himself is a threat to Western values.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milei&rsquo;s remarks garnered condemnation from Petro.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is what Hitler said,&rdquo; Petro wrote. Milei has not publicly responded to Petro&rsquo;s comparison as of press time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milei, a lawmaker and anti-establishment presidential candidate for the (&ldquo;Liberty Advances&rdquo;) coalition, is known for his outspoken and no-holds-barred contempt for communism, denouncing it as a &ldquo;murderous system&rdquo; and socialism as a &ldquo;disease of the soul.&rdquo; Milei is a far-right candidate who describes himself as libertarian and anarcho-capitalist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milei emerged as the most voted candidate in Argentina&rsquo;s Open Primary election process this month, leading to October&rsquo;s general election, with roughly 30 percent of the votes. During the open primary, all individuals who wish to be presidential candidates appear on the ballot; those who receive over 1.5 percent of the vote appear formally on the official ballot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milei continued his explanation by giving his hypothesis on the expansion of leftism in Latin America following the fall of the Berlin Wall, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the rise of the Sao Paulo Forum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;After the fall of the Berlin Wall, here in 1989 the Sao Paulo Forum was set up and the intention of the Sao Paulo Forum was to create the Latin American Soviet Union,&rdquo; Milei said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is a very concrete plan, there are three parts. In the first part, 90 percent of the battle is cultural and 10 percent is how to obtain resources,&rdquo; Milei continued his explanation. &ldquo;The second stage is 50 percent cultural and 50 percent advancing in regulation and attacking companies. Perhaps the last part is the expropriation part.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sao Paulo Forum is a coalition of Latin American and Caribbean leftist governments and political parties established in 1990 by the Brazilian Worker&rsquo;s Party (PT) &mdash; a political party founded by Brazil&rsquo;s radical leftist President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva. The Forum was established to help leftists in Latin America coordinate messaging, ideology, and policy execution across the region.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What is, deep down, a socialist? He is garbage, he is human excrement, [someone] who basically, because he does not want to support the brilliance of another human being, is willing for everyone to be in misery,&rdquo; Milei asserted. &ldquo;To be a socialist, deep down, is a sickness of the spirit, a sickness of the soul. They are bad people, that is the reality.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The values of socialism are envy, hate, resentment, unequal treatment before the law, theft, and murder,&rdquo; he asserted.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO RELEASED OF NEBRASKA TE ARIK GILBERT AFTER BREAKING INTO VAPE SHOP, STEALING $1.6K IN PRODUCTS</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for my favorite topic, sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska tight end Arik Gilbert is in a world of trouble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert, 21, was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of burglary after breaking into SJ&rsquo;s Liquor and Vape Shop in Lincoln. Gilbert allegedly stole $1,672 worth of products, including cigars and vapes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities booked Gilbert at Lancaster County Jail. Bond was set at $5,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A security video circulating on social media shows a shirtless Gilbert, hiding behind a makeshift mask&nbsp; made from his shirt, using cement from the store&rsquo;s parking lot to break through the initial glass door. Once inside, Gilbert attempts to kick down another door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert joined LSU in 2020 before leaving for Georgia ahead of his second year. The former top TE prospect posted 35 catches for 368 yards and two touchdowns in eight games with LSU.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert also flirted with going to Florida before joining the Bulldogs. Buried in Georgia&rsquo;s offense, Gilbert transferred to Nebraska this offseason but awaits eligibility from the NCAA for his second transfer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule reacted to news of the arrest, as relayed by KETV7, and spoke on the ongoing struggles for Gilbert this offseason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rhule said in a press conference: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to help him through some of the issues he&rsquo;s dealing with in his life, have been really proud of the job he had done in the spring and summer. But to be honest, during camp, he said he&rsquo;s had some struggles, he&rsquo;s working overcome them.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-idalia-landfall-florida-big-bend-category-3-tens-thousands-without-power"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-idalia-landfall-florida-big-bend-category-3-tens-thousands-without-power</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hurricane Idalia makes landfall over Florida's Big Bend as a Category 3, hundreds of thousands without power</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hurricane Idalia made landfall over Florida&rsquo;s Gulf Coast as a "catastrophic" Category 3 storm Wednesday at 7:45 a.m., leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power, officials said. It has since been downgraded to a Category 1 storm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Idalia produced storm surges that reached several feet in some areas and brought damaging winds that howled up to 130 miles per hour at one point, according to the National Hurricane Center. It also caused flooding that completely encompassed Floridian roadways when it passed the Apalachee Bay and made landfall over Florida's Big Bend region, where the peninsula merges into the Panhandle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he had directed law enforcement to "protect people's property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We are not going to tolerate any looting in the aftermath of a natural disaster. I mean it's just ridiculous that you would try to do something like that on the heels of an almost Category 4 hurricane hitting this community," DeSantis said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He warned would-be looters that they could very well be walking into the home of a Second Amendment advocate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I've seen signs in people's yards, and I would say it's probably here, &lsquo;You Loot, We Shoot.&rsquo; You never know what's behind that door," DeSantis said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Biden said he had spoken with the governors of states most impacted by the storm and vowed all federal assistance, including 1,500 personnel and 900 Coast Guard personnel throughout the southeast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Federal teams on the ground are going to continue to work with the first responders in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, to get people to safety," Biden said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At least two people have died in vehicle accidents since the storm made landfall, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. In Pasco County, a 40-year-old male lost control of his Ford Ranger and collided into a tree after driving too fast for the weather conditions, while a 59-year-old male died in Alachua County after his Toyota Tacoma plunged into a ditch and crashed into a nearby tree line, officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The storm has been impacting Gainesville, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Dowling Park, Lake City, Cedar Key, Chiefland, Newberry, Cross City, Apalachicola, and Perry. Its impact will also be felt in Orlando, Spring Hill, Bradenton, Bartow, Ocala, Lake Placid, Tampa, Sarasota, and Fort Myers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">By 11 a.m. Wednesday, the storm was a Category 1, with sustained winds of 90 mph, and its impact was being felt in Georgia, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Authorities continue to urge caution as, despite the slight decline, the storm remains dangerous and potentially life-threatening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">More than 340,000 Americans were without power as Idalia continued to blast Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolina, according to Fox Weather.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Further outages are expected as the storm continues pummeling the state as Idalia continues its northeast path to Georgia, the Carolinas and then the Atlantic Ocean.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The National Weather Service in Tallahassee had called Idalia "an unprecedented event" as it rapidly intensified over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and obtained Category 4 status within 24 hours. It downgraded slightly, officially becoming a high-end Category 3 storm when it made landfall, before downgrading again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The NWS also said "no one" has witnessed a storm strengthen to such magnitude in such a short time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/08/30/trump-raises-more-than-20-million-in-august-n574661#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/08/30/trump-raises-more-than-20-million-in-august-n574661#google_vignette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trump raises more than $20 million in August</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Donald Trump has raised $20M in August, according to his campaign. Since he was processed in the Fulton County jail and had a mugshot taken, he has raised more than $9.4M.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite the multiple indictments and the first-ever presidential mugshot, his contributors continue to send in campaign contributions. The campaign knew the mugshot would be a money-maker and fundraising came swiftly as soon as it was released. The angry scowl seen around the world is marketed on various merchandise on Trump&rsquo;s website. Trump haters are buying up merchandise on other sites and displaying their purchases on social media like it is a badge of honor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Since the moment my mugshot was plastered all over the Internet in a vicious attempt to wrongfully turn me into a criminal, our movement has RAISED $9 MILLION from grassroots patriots like YOU,&rdquo; Trump said in a statement released by the Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;In fact, our campaign recorded its SINGLE GREATEST FUNDRAISING DAY EVER,&rdquo; the 77-year-old said of his Georgia surrender bounty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">His fundraising numbers spiked once the mugshot was released &ndash; which it immediately was &ndash; with supporters particularly pleased with the &ldquo;never surrender&rdquo; slogan. Critics noted the irony since the mugshot was taken when he surrendered to authorities to be processed at the jail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The merchandise sales are impressive so far. The totals reported include 36,000 T-shirts, 24,000 coffee mugs and 8,600 posters. One thing that people talk about is the amount of money Trump is spending on legal bills and how a lot of those bills are being paid by campaign donations. It&rsquo;s being reported that the mugshot merchandise money is being earmarked by the campaign for political and campaign activities and won&rsquo;t be used to cover legal expense. Trump has spent tens of millions of dollars on legal bills since the season of indictments began. Altogether, Trump is facing 91 counts in all four indictments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trump raised $5M in the first 48 hours after the indictment in Manhattan and $10M over five days. After the indictment over the mishandling of classified documents, his campaign said it raised $6.6M. Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said that last Friday was the biggest fundraising day for the Trump campaign so far, with $4.18M raised on the day alone. Trump&rsquo;s mugshot was taken on Thursday night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/29/chicago-tv-news-reporter-on-assignment-to-cover-thefts-robbed-of-video-camera-at-gunpoint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://nypost.com/2023/08/29/chicago-tv-news-reporter-on-assignment-to-cover-thefts-robbed-of-video-camera-at-gunpoint/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Chicago TV news reporter on assignment to cover thefts robbed of video camera at gunpoint</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A pair of Chicago journalists were held up at gunpoint by three men wearing ski masks &mdash; while covering the spate of robberies and carjackings that plagued the Windy City over the weekend, according to local police and news outlets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A Univision Chicago reporter and a cameraman were set to do a live shot in the upscale Wicker Park section at around 4:30 a.m. on Monday when a black SUV and a gray sedan pulled up alongside them, according to the news site CWBChicago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The two male journalists &mdash; one 28 and the other 42 &mdash; were standing near the 1200 block of North Milwaukee Ave. when &ldquo;three unknown male offenders exited the vehicles, wearing ski masks and displaying firearms,&rdquo; Chicago police officials told The Post on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The thugs made off with their video camera before fleeing, cops said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">No injuries were reported and none of the suspects were in custody as of Tuesday afternoon, police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The brazen attack was part of a spree that involved at least 30 others who were either robbed or carjacked in the crime-ravaged city on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, according to local authorities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Luis Godinez, the vice president of Univision Chicago, circulated an email to employees confirming that their colleagues were the ones who were robbed, according to the news site Block Club Chicago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The fact that the news personnel were now part of the story is &ldquo;total irony,&rdquo; the Univision reporter, who wished to remain anonymous, told the site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;As a journalist, you never want to be the story, right?&rdquo; the reporter told Block Club Chicago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Earlier this month, a Chicago TV news videographer had two of his phones robbed while preparing to cover a news conference on the city&rsquo;s West Side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Law enforcement officials have yet to make arrests in those cases, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://beckernews.com/99-of-fatalities-in-united-states-not-primarily-caused-by-covid-19-cdc-data-51670/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://beckernews.com/99-of-fatalities-in-united-states-not-primarily-caused-by-covid-19-cdc-data-51670/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>99% of Fatalities in United States Not Primarily Caused by Covid-19: CDC Data</strong></span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite the rampant fear being spread in the U.S. media about new Covid subvariants, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Infection cast doubt on any cause for alarm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">CDC statistics reveal that only 1% of all weekly deaths across the United States are attributed to Covid-19. For the week ending on August 19, the CDC&rsquo;s Covid dashboard reports 324 Covid-related fatalities, constituting a mere 1.7% of all deaths during that period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Although the percentage of deaths due to Covid for the week ending August 19 reflects a minor uptick from the prior week, it is substantially lower than the pandemic&rsquo;s apex, when the CDC cited Covid as the cause of nearly one in three deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Data highlights that states such as Washington, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina, Maryland, and New York are experiencing higher rates of Covid-induced deaths. Maryland and Florida lead with 3.4%, while Washington, Tennessee, North Carolina, and New York are around the 2% mark. In contrast, more than 24 states recorded between one and nine Covid-related deaths for the week ending August 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Additional data points out that the fatality rate is marginally higher among women than men, and is most elevated among individuals aged 75 and older.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This latest data may offer some comfort at a time when anxieties are escalating across the country due to the spread of highly transmissible new Covid variants, resulting in an increase in infections and hospitalizations, as well as the reintroduction of certain Covid mandates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Recently detected variants like EG.5 (Eris) and BA.8.26 (Pirola) have emerged in multiple countries, including the United States. These variants have undergone extensive mutations, making them potentially more adept at dodging vaccine and natural immunity, and contributing to a rise in infections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite the appearance of these variants, infections in the U.S. have doubled and hospital admissions have risen for the fifth consecutive week, but they remain near historical lows. Importantly, Covid-related deaths have not surged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Last week&rsquo;s concerns over a Covid resurgence led Hollywood&rsquo;s Lionsgate studio to enforce mask mandates at its Santa Monica, California offices. This decision was later rescinded within days. Similarly, Rutgers University in New Jersey and Morris Brown College in Georgia both declared that face coverings will be mandatory for faculty and students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Medical facilities like Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Santa Rosa, California, and Upstate Community Hospital in Syracuse, New York, have reinstated mask requirements for healthcare workers, patients, and visitors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Kentucky, the Lee County School District shut down classes less than two weeks after reopening, as nearly 20% of its student body fell ill with a &lsquo;tripledemic&rsquo; of illnesses, including Covid, strep throat, and influenza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Biden indicated on Friday that his administration will &ldquo;likely&rdquo; recommend another Covid booster vaccine soon. He also signed a proposal asking Congress for additional funds to modify Covid vaccines to better counteract the new variants. Nevertheless, public interest in booster shots remains tepid, with only 18% of eligible Americans having received any form of booster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As pointed out by the Mayo Clinic, about 81% of Covid-related deaths in the United States have been in people age 65 and older, adding that &ldquo;risks are even higher for older people when they have other health conditions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Even when accounting for the difficulty in assessing cause of death in a predominately elderly population with comorbidities, the Covid-19 pandemic nonetheless had a 99.7% survival rate in the United States.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DeSantis expands Florida's state of emergency as Hurricane Idalia to make landfall Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded a state of emergency to include more counties as the southern U.S. braces for Hurricane Idalia to make landfall Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 33 of Florida's 67 counties were under the previous executive order, DeSantis' updated order issued Monday now includes 46 counties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service said Tuesday that Idalia is "expected to rapidly intensify into an extremely dangerous major hurricane" before making landfall.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis said Monday that Idalia is expected to develop into at least a category 3 hurricane by the time it makes landfall, according to CBS News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service states that with a category 3 hurricane, "devastating damage will occur," and things such as utilities, trees and well-built homes may incur major damages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for Idalia's landfall, DeSantis fully activated the Florida National Guard, and 5,500 are expected to be mobilized to respond to the storm. Additionally, dozens of public schools have closed down and the state government is taking additional steps to ensure people have access to food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden posted Monday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that he spoke with DeSantis "to inform him that we've approved the Emergency Declaration for Florida as they prepare for Hurricane Idalia," and he said, "Florida has my full support as they prepare for Idalia and its aftermath."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/kyle-rittenhouse-sued-by-estate-of-the-child-molester-he-blew-away-in-self-defense"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/kyle-rittenhouse-sued-by-estate-of-the-child-molester-he-blew-away-in-self-defense</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Rittenhouse sued by estate of the convicted child molester he blew away in self-defense</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Rittenhouse shot three attackers who mobbed him during a leftist riot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020. Two of the three are no more. He was cleared of all charges in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being found not guilty by a jury of his peers, Rittenhouse has since had to fight various efforts to paint him as a villain and to punish him for defending himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent attempt comes in the form of a civil lawsuit filed by the convicted child molester Joseph Rosenbaum's estate Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Scorecard reported that the suit names Rittenhouse as a defendant along with local sheriff's departments, Kenosha officials, the City of Kenosha, the City of West Allis, and various counties, demanding "compensatory and punitive damages" for the "wrongful death" of Rosenbaum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post noted that Rosenbaum spent most of his adult life in prison after preying upon five preteen boys.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears his life on the outside was marked by rage and rootlessness. For instance, one month prior to his demise, Rosenbaum's fianc&eacute;e, Kariann Swart, pressed charges against him for domestic abuse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just hours before catching four bullets, the homeless and bipolar 36-year-old had been released from a hospital following a suicide attempt, reported NPR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh out of the hospital, Rosenbaum joined in the destructive riots that kicked off in response to the non-fatal police shooting of Jacob Blake, whom state prosecutors indicated had been wanted on a felony warrant and was armed with a knife.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rittenhouse's lawyers claimed during his murder trial that Rosenbaum attempted to "engage" the youth, at which point Rittenhouse attempted to flee. Rosenbaum gave chase, threw a sack of belongings at him, then, according to witness testimony, attempted to disarm the then-17-year-old by force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footage of the incident shows that it was only when the 17-year-old appeared cornered in a car lot did he open fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to claiming Rosenbaum was a peaceful protester who "was not a danger to himself or others," the Rosenbaum estate cast Rittenhouse in the lawsuit as a menace who "fired his assault rifle indiscriminately multiple times," despite the 17-year-old's documented restraint and sure aim.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Rosenbaum can be seen on film chasing down the boy, the suit alleges that "there was no justification for Defendant Rittenhouse to point his weapon at Joseph Rosenbaum."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Federal judge dismisses University of Wyoming students' lawsuit against trans sorority member</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Wyoming sorority members&rsquo; lawsuit for the inclusion of a transgender student in their organization was dismissed by a federal judge on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, several current and former members of the University of Wyoming&rsquo;s Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority sued the national sorority to revoke the membership allowing what they described as "peeping" transgender student Artemis Langford. Despite the women&rsquo;s descriptions of Langford&rsquo;s alleged actions, the judge ruled that the school did not violate any policies by allowing the student to join.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The University of Wyoming chapter voted to admit - and, more broadly, a sorority of hundreds of thousands approved - Langford. With its inquiry beginning and ending there, the Court will not define &lsquo;woman&rsquo; today. The delegate of a private, voluntary organization interpreted &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, otherwise undefined in the nonprofit's bylaws, expansively; this Judge may not invade Kappa Kappa Gamma's freedom of expressive association and inject the circumscribed definition Plaintiffs urge," the judge said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling continued, "Holding that Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege their derivative, breach of contract, tortious interference, and direct claims, the Court dismisses, without prejudice, Plaintiffs' causes of action."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit brought by seven members of Kappa Kappa Gamma claimed that Langford violated sorority policies by joining a sorority despite not being a woman or making efforts to appear female.</span></p>

<p><strong>Biden Seeks Long-Term Military Aid to Ukraine to Prevent Next President From Scaling Back Funding</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration is seeking to hammer out a long-term Ukraine aid agreement with European allies in hopes of both preventing Russia from gaining an edge on the battlefield and hamstringing a future president&rsquo;s ability to scale back U.S. commitments, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scheme emerged during sideline talks among Group of Seven leaders at a NATO summit in July, and so far involves negotiations between the U.S. and Ukraine, and between the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ukraine, according to the WSJ. It&rsquo;s an attempt, in part, to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin he can simply wait until a new American administration, as several top GOP political contenders have expressed intention to reduce or eliminate U.S. aid that makes up the brunt of Western support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building up Kyiv&rsquo;s defense forces in the long term can theoretically deter Russia from invading again, officials calculated, according to the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump has maintained a lead in Republican primary candidate polling and could face a second showdown with President Joe Biden in the 2024 election. Trump has claimed he could solve the war &ldquo;within 24 hours.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the first Republican primary debate Wednesday, several candidates indicated they would support drawing down aid for Ukraine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighteen countries not belonging to the G-7 wealthy democracies, including the Netherlands and Sweden, have also agreed to the long-term security assistance pledge for Ukraine, according to the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European capitals want to cement support and restrict ways countries could renege on pledges, fearing what might happen during a second Trump administration, according to the WSJ. At present, Western European nations lack the industrial and financial capacity to match the billions in annual military aid provided by the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has devoted more than $40 billion worth of weapons and equipment, as well as training and investment into U.S. weapons companies, for the purpose of aiding Ukraine&rsquo;s resistance. The aid has exposed weaknesses in American military readiness and industrial base capacity, provoking criticism that the U.S. should be using those funds to shore up defenses with an eye toward China as the war in Ukraine drags on with no end in sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the practical workings of the agreement pose significant hurdles to the Biden administration&rsquo;s goals, the WSJ reported, citing officials. A sitting president has limited ability to bind his successor to any initiative or policy.</span></p>]]></description>
