   <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Dr. Aaron Rock covers the difference between a public agent of Justice (police officers, judges, by-law officers, etc.) and useful idiots, and draws helpful comparisons between how they treat protests to causes they are sympathetic to, vs causes they aren't.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Today David explains why, if he were still a state Senator, he would evaluate forthcoming legislation in several states that would subject pregnant women to a criminal sanction through the prism of Matthew 6:33 and how he would do it. Then he will give the remarks he would provide in a legislative hearing. Finally, he closes with a challenge to Christians on both sides of the issue.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Hunter Biden makes surprise appearance at Oversight contempt proceeding in congress, then storms out</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After defying a Congressional subpoena in December, Hunter Biden made a surprise appearance at Wednesday&rsquo;s markup meeting in which lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee are working on a resolution to hold the president&rsquo;s son in contempt of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Oversight member Nancy Mace addressed Biden directly.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene began speaking Hunter Biden stormed out, with Greene telling him as he left, "Apparently you&rsquo;re afraid of my words."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1745108562043437517"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1745108562043437517</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play 0:00-0:39</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then as Hunter Biden was exiting the building, a man asked him on numerous occasions, &ldquo;are you on crack today?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter Biden attorney Abbe Lowell addressed reporters in the halls of Congress, saying that "Republicans have sought to use [Hunter Biden} as a surrogate to attack his father."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowell said that "we have offered to work with House committees to see what and how relevant information to any legitimate inquiry could be provided."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our first five offers were ignored. And then in November, they issued a subpoena for a behind-closed-doors deposition, a tactic that the Republicans have repeatedly misused in their political crusade to selectively leave and mischaracterize what witnesses have said."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter Biden was subpoenaed to appear for a closed-door deposition on December 13, 2023. He refused to attend this deposition, instead speaking from the Capitol lawn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter Biden declared that he would only appear in a public session, but Committee on House Administration rules states that depositions of a witness are to take place only in the presence of the "Committee, Committee staff designed by the Chairman or the ranking minority member, an official reporter, the witness, and the witness&rsquo; two designated attorneys." Hunter Biden, however, doesn't think this rule should apply to him.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mexican president demands $20 billion and work permits for 10 million Hispanics before offering immigration help</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently revealed what that U.S. must do in order for the Mexican government to help slow down the flow of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, and the price is steep.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News Digital reported that Lopez Obrador announced his demands during a press conference on Friday. The development comes just a week after the Mexican president met with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Mexico City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for Mexico to help the U.S., Lopez Obrador demanded that the U.S. provide $20 billion to Latin American and Caribbean countries; provide work visas to 10 million Hispanics who have been working in the U.S. for at least 10 years; end sanctions against Venezuela; and put an end to the blockade of Cuba.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demands have put pressure on President Joe Biden, who has not polled well on illegal immigration since he took over the presidency in 2021. The report noted that the border experienced a large surge of migrants this fall, with around 240,000 encounters per month toward the end of 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some of the decisions &mdash; if Biden decides to go through with the proposal &mdash; would need to get the approval of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez Obrador has not been shy about challenging U.S. politicians on the topic of illegal immigration. He recently challenged Texas Governor Greg Abbott on one of the state's new immigration laws just last month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blaze News reported last month that Abbott had ratified legislation that would make illegal immigration a state crime. The law, Senate Bill 4, moved forward after the Biden administration seemed unwilling to enforce federal immigration law. The state authorities will now be able to arrest foreign nationals who sneak into the country illegally, and magistrates will be able to order illegal aliens to leave the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez Obrador said last month: "The Texas governor acts that way because he wants to be the Republican vice presidential candidate and wants to win popularity with these measures."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He&rsquo;s not going to win anything. On the contrary, he is going to lose support because there are a lot of Mexicans in Texas, a lot of migrants."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the law recently ratified in Texas will not punish those who enter the country legally &mdash; only those who attempt to circumvent U.S. law.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://notthebee.com/article/parents-who-refuse-to-go-along-with-their-childs-gender-transition-can-now-face-7-years-in-jail-in-scotland"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://notthebee.com/article/parents-who-refuse-to-go-along-with-their-childs-gender-transition-can-now-face-7-years-in-jail-in-scotland</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scottish parents could face years in jail for preventing kids from "dressing in a way that reflects their sexual orientation or gender identity"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scotland is really making it simple for parents. Let them trans your kids or you go to jail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may think that's overstatement, but that's actually the plan in Scotland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents who do not go along with "affirming" their child's "gender identity" could face jail for SEVEN YEARS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals published on Tuesday state that actions designed to "change or suppress" another individual's gender identity, causing them physical or psychological harm, would become illegal under the radical law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNP (Scotland National Party) ministers acknowledged that so-called conversion practices often took place in a "family setting", raising the prospect that parents could be criminalised if they refuse to go along with their child's declaration that they are transgender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just so you know the extent of this proposal and how it could apply to families, one of the examples of "conversion therapy" punishable by jail time is preventing a child from wearing clothing of their preferred gender identity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if Billy wants to wear a dress and you stop him you would be guilty of "conversion therapy" and be subject to punishment under the law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don't do anything, the state could preemptively take action against you based solely on your beliefs!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they know you're a conservative Christian in Scotland they could issue civil orders against you, warning you not to cross the line of telling your kids what to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Scottish National Party is currently the largest and most represented party in parliament. They hold nearly a majority in the multi-party system. If they're fully on board with this there's not much that can be done to stop them in parliament.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's important to note this is in the "public consultation" phase which, in Scotland and the UK, means they have to lay out the plan for public feedback, in this case until April, before moving forward with the proposal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So my suggestion, between now and April, is for every freedom and faith-loving Scot to channel his inner Braveheart and publicly oppose this radical anti-family, anti-faith, anti-human proposal from the Scottish liberals.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wash. Democrats deem ammo a &lsquo;privilege&rsquo; as way to end gun rights</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Democrats opened the 2024 legislative session with another assault on gun rights. This time they hope to reclassify ammunition as a &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; &mdash; one that should be subject to an onerous tax because the one thing they love more than taking away guns is taking away your money.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Representatives My-Linh Thai and Liz Berry, both Democrats, introduced House Bill 2238. Under the auspices of public safety, claiming access to ammunition is the cause of violence and not their soft-on-crime policies that go easy on criminals (including those who use guns in their crimes), the bill imposes an 11% sales and use tax on ammunition statewide. This would be an additional tax on top of the sales tax and any other tax that may levied when purchasing ammunition. The city of Seattle, for example, imposes a per-round tax.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the bill also reclassified ammunition, claiming you do not have a right to purchase them as a consumer. Instead, it&rsquo;s labeled a &ldquo;privilege.&rdquo; The legislation creates a new section in pre-existing law that reads, &ldquo;A use tax is levied on every person in this state for the privilege of using ammunition as a consumer at the rate of 11% of the selling price.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Reps. Thai nor Berry responded to inquiries asking the basis for their claim that ammunition is a privilege. But Washington Democrats have set the stage to make this outrageous claim.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Democrats have consistently moved to make gun ownership more onerous for non-criminal Washingtonians. The end goal for Democrats is to ban guns so that we cannot protect ourselves against the criminals they embolden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of a flat-out ban against guns, they&rsquo;ve hoped to reclassify ammunition as a privilege by severely restricting how much of it a gun owner can use at a time. The Washington Legislature approved a bill to prohibit the sale, distribution, and manufacture of firearm magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This is meant to set the precedent claiming Washingtonians do not have a constitutional right to ammunition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most of their clearly unconstitutional bills, they&rsquo;re based on a flimsy and purposefully obtuse understanding of the right to bear arms. The Washington State Constitution, Article I, Section 24, clearly states that &ldquo;the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or the state, shall not be impaired.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot bear arms if the firearm has no ammunition in it. This provision, like the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, implicitly includes all necessary components of firearms like ammunition as essential to the protected exercise of the right to bear arms. Without access to ammunition, the right to bear arms would be rendered meaningless, as firearms without ammunition are unable to fulfill their intended purpose in defense of oneself or the state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ironic twist, Democrats are the best gun salesmen. Their actions are pushing Washingtonians into purchases they might not otherwise make.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Democrats&rsquo; interest in banning guns does not extend to the criminals they support with legislation that keeps them out of prison before the end of their sentences under the claim the criminal justice system is racist. By passing legislation that is clearly tied to the rise in crime, they give every Washingtonian ample reason to purchase firearms for self-defense. We have a rise in violent crime in Seattle, where homicides have hit historic highs. Democrats pretend they hold no blame in this new reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Reps Tarra Simmons and David Hackney pushed a bill in the 2022 legislative session to lessen charges against drive-by shooters. It would even be applied retroactively to release a drive-by shooter serving time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They claimed the change promoted &ldquo;racial equity in the criminal legal system&rdquo; because they implied too many black people commit drive-by shootings and it&rsquo;s unfair for them to be charged more than white people who don&rsquo;t commit as many drive-by shootings. It was as silly an argument as it was racist. Only after considerable public pushback, did the bill die. But it seems reasonable to want a firearm to protect yourself when you have pro-criminal legislators pushing dangerous bills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Rep. Roger Goodman, another anti-gun Democrat, is back this year with HB 1268. It would prevent judges from offering additional years of prison to violent criminals who use guns during their crimes (&ldquo;stacking&rdquo; on gun enhancement charges). It even offers &ldquo;good time credits&rdquo; (or earned release time) to felons serving time on a firearm or deadly weapon enhancement. Any one of these criminals released early is reason enough to own a firearm of your own.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily News Brief for Wednesday, January 10th, 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Samaritan Ministries January 2024</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tired of someone else telling you where to go when you have a medical need? Are you ready to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">take control of your health care? Then it&rsquo;s time to take a look at Samaritan Ministries. It&rsquo;s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Biblical, affordable health care sharing, with no restrictive networks. Here&rsquo;s how it works. When a medical need arises, you choose the health care provider that&rsquo;s right for you and have a say in the treatment you receive. Send your medical bills to Samaritan Ministries, and they&rsquo;ll notify fellow members to pray for you and send money directly to you to help you pay those bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Join 80,000 Christian households across the nation who have already taken control of their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">health care. Go to samaritan ministries dot org slash cross politic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-tells-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigrants-released-into-us-sources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-tells-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigrants-released-into-us-sources</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Mayorkas tells Border Patrol agents that &lsquo;above 85%&rsquo; of illegal immigrants released into US</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday admitted to Border Patrol agents that the current rate of release for illegal immigrants apprehended at the southern border is "above 85%," sources told Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mayorkas made the remarks when meeting privately with agents in Eagle Pass, Texas, according to three Border Patrol sources who were in the room and heard the remarks themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The conversation happened during the muster for agents in the busy border area. Fox is told Mayorkas was asked directly about comments he made on "Special Report" last week when he was asked by anchor Bret Baier about reporting that over 70% of migrants are released into the U.S. each day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"It would not surprise me at all. I know the data," Mayorkas said. "And I will tell you that when individuals are released, they are released into immigration enforcement proceedings. They are on alternatives to detention. And we have returned or removed a record number of individuals. We are enforcing the laws that Congress has passed. "</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox is told that on Monday agents pushed him on those remarks, saying that the number is even higher than 70%, and then Mayorkas acknowledged a release rate of "above 85%."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mayorkas had also said last week on "Special Report" that "well more than a million" migrants are released into the U.S. annually, and argued repeatedly that it is up to Congress to provide more funding and immigration reform to fix what he has called a "broken" system. He said that the agency is limited in detention capacity by funding provided by Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"When somebody enters the country, we place them in immigration enforcement proceedings pursuant to immigration law, and if their claim for relief, their claim to remain in the United States succeeds, then by law they are able to stay here," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The remarks come just two days before the House Homeland Security Committee holds its first impeachment hearing, featuring multiple state attorneys general who will testify about the impact the crisis has had on their states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The hearing on Wednesday marks the first impeachment hearing after a year of investigations and reports by the House Homeland Security Committee which looked at the handling of the nearly three-year migrant crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Republicans have blamed the historic migrant crisis, which saw 302,000 migrant encounters last month alone on Biden-era policies, including the releases of migrants into the interior -- dubbed "catch-and-release." They have pointed to the broad use of parole, as well as narrowed ICE enforcement and the stopping of wall construction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The administration says it is dealing with a hemisphere-wide crisis and needs more funding and comprehensive immigration reform from Congress. It has claimed it is expanding "lawful migration pathways" and increasing consequences for illegal entry, but can only do so much with a "broken" system. Mayorkas and other DHS officials have said that it has removed or returned more than 470,000 people since May, which is more than in the entirety of FY 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At a press availability later on Monday, Mayorkas highlighted the removals and returns, saying it is more than in any other five-month period in the last 10 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"In fact, the majority of all Southwest Border migrant encounters throughout this Administration have been removed, returned, or expelled &ndash; the majority of them," he said. "We are doing everything we can, within a broken system, to incentivize noncitizens to use lawful pathways, to impose consequences on those who do not, and to reduce irregular migration."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The White House has also requested $14 billion in border funding from Congress as part of its emergency supplemental spending proposal, but that is being held up as Republicans demand significantly more restrictions on the release of migrants into the interior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Mayorkas said last week that it was that broken system, not administration policy, which was the magnet drawing migrants to the border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Separately, the administration last week announced a lawsuit against the state of Texas after Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law that allows state and local law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants. The lawsuit claims that the law is unconstitutional and interferes with the federal government's authority on immigration matters.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hot Mic Catches Journos Joking About Trump Being Assassinated</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Microphones caught journalists waiting for Donald Trump to arrive at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in Washington D.C. joking about the president being assassinated on Tuesday. Trump is attending the D.C. Court of Appeals to hear the opening oral arguments in his appeal against Jack Smith&rsquo;s efforts to prosecute him over January 6th, and journalists gathered outside the courthouse in substantial numbers ahead of his arrival.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Two of them could be heard in live feeds joking about having a &ldquo;good shot&rdquo; at the America First leader when he arrived, particularly if he showed up driving a convertible like the one the late President John F. Kennedy was riding in when he was shot in the head in 1963:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1744738203616399859"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1744738203616399859</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">If you couldn&rsquo;t hear what they said:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">First Journalist: You know what the worst part is? Even if he has his window open and he&rsquo;s hanging out of it, he will be on the other side of the street.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Second Journalist: I mean, if he&rsquo;s driving, we&rsquo;ve got a good shot!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">First Journalist: Yeah, if he&rsquo;s driving with the front window open?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Second Journalist: Yeah, or if it&rsquo;s a convertible?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">First Journalist: Yeah. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">First Journalist: Like JFK?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Second Journalist: (laughs)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trump&rsquo;s hearing is being overseen by a panel of two Joe Biden-appointed judges and one George H. W. Bush-appointed judge. His lawyers argue the Smith prosecution amounts to double jeopardy, as Trump was already tried and acquitted over January 6th by the U.S. Senate, and that Smith is also violating the principle of presidential immunity for official acts.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Man Discovers iPhone That Fell Out of Alaska Air 1282: &lsquo;Perfectly Intact&rsquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A Portland man recovered a cell phone, which is believed to be owned by a passenger of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 after it was sucked out of the plane when the door plug blew open.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Writing on X, the man, Sean Bates, posted a photo of the phone:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Found an iPhone on the side of the road,&rdquo; he wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Still in airplane mode with half a battery and open to a baggage claim for #AlaskaAirlines ASA1282.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bates found the phone when he was out walking before posting it on social media, which also showed what appeared to be an Alaska Airlines baggage flight receipt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The image showed the baggage receipt for the traveler and a piece of a charger still stuck into the phone&rsquo;s charging port.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bates claimed the phone was &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo; intact with &ldquo;no scratches on it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In a TikTok video, Bates said he was walking in Portland on Sunday after the National Transportation Safety Bureau asked him to report any debris or plane parts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The door for the plane was also recovered after another Portland resident named Bob found the plug in his yard,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Thank you, Bob,&rdquo; NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bates found one of the two cell phones that were recovered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Last week, Alaska Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing after its passenger window blew open.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Boeing 737 Max was heading to Ontario, California w, when a large window busted open, causing severe depressurization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said in a statement:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Following tonight&rsquo;s event on Flight 1282, we have decided to take the precautionary step of temporarily grounding our fleet of 65 Boeing 737-9 aircraft.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;My heart goes out to those who were on this flight &ndash; I am so sorry for what you experienced.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Video footage showed the plane in the air with the window open as oxygen masks angled over passengers&rsquo; seats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/rebel-news-reporter-arrested-by-trudeaus-police-for-asking-a-question/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/rebel-news-reporter-arrested-by-trudeaus-police-for-asking-a-question/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Rebel News Reporter Arrested by Trudeau&rsquo;s Police for Asking a Question</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">David Menzies, the reporter for Canada&rsquo;s conservative Rebel News Network, was arrested on Monday for asking Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland a question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A police officer reportedly accused Menzies of assault despite the reporter not making any physical contact with Freeland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The video of the incident, posted by Rebel News chief Ezra Levant, showed Enzies asking Freeland about Canada&rsquo;s refusal to label Iran&rsquo;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC) as a terrorist organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The video shows Menzies keeping pace with the Deputy Prime Minister as he walks down the street when a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) stands in his way and begins claiming Menzies &ldquo;assaulted&rdquo; him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Menzies does not appear to notice the RCMP officer because his attention is on Freeland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The officer then appears to set a &ldquo;pick,&rdquo; basketball-style, as a pretext for accusing Menzies of assaulting him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">However, there is no evidence that Menzies intended to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re under arrest for assault,&rdquo; said the officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The officer moved Menzies towards a vehicle, identifying himself as police and saying he was under arrest for assault. Menzies said the officer was the person who blocked his way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I was just scrumming Chrystia Freeland,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The officer acknowledged Menzies was being arrested for assaulting a police officer. In response, he accused him of assaulting him three years ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Another RCMP officer said Menzies was being arrested because of his actions. This is because he was almost pushing people over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;That was a little bit aggressive for what was happening,&rdquo; said the officer before the arrest occurred.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">True North managing editor Andrew Lawton said Menzies was later released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Have confirmed that Menzies was released without charges,&rdquo; said Lawton.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">And before we go, it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2024/01/07/nolte-existential-crisis-woke-hollywood-loses-moviegoers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2024/01/07/nolte-existential-crisis-woke-hollywood-loses-moviegoers/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Existential Crisis&rsquo; as Woke Hollywood Loses 20% of Moviegoers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The start of the COVID pandemic is about four years in the rearview and still being blamed for Hollywood losing 20 percent of moviegoers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;One out of every five moviegoers has vanished since the pandemic, according to research compiled by one Hollywood studio,&rdquo; reports the far-left Hollywood Reporter. &ldquo;Whether they&rsquo;ll ever return to see a film on the big screen is anyone&rsquo;s guess &mdash; and, if they do, when.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the last pre-pandemic year of 2019, the domestic box office is down 21 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lengthy article is full of facts and figures. It also accidentally answers the question it asks about why this is happening and how to fix it, but it never acknowledges the answer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is right here: Spider-Man: No Way Home, Barbie, Oppenheimer, John Wick 4, Top Gun: Maverick, and Sound of Freedom. Those titles were monster hits during and after the pandemic for one very simple reason: people wanted to see them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that the reasons behind this drop in moviegoing ranks is a whodunnit is absurd. The titles above prove that people will still turn out in droves if they find something appealing. So, how can anyone still blame the pandemic for the drop in moviegoing? If the pandemic was to blame, nothing could succeed in theaters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, Taylor Swift&rsquo;s big 2023 concert tour proves the moviegoing demo isn&rsquo;t afraid to congregate or come out of their homes. She&rsquo;s packing them in up to the rafters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article also suggests moviegoers are tired of aging franchises. How can that be true when the fifth biggest global blockbuster of 2023 was the tenth chapter in the 24-year-old Fast &amp; Furious franchise?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article suggests moviegoers are tired of superheroes. How can that be true when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was 2023&rsquo;s fourth biggest global blockbuster?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audiences worn out by franchises and superhero movies would not go to see any aging franchise or superhero movie. Fast X and Guardians became hits because people wanted to see them. But why Fast X and Guardians 3, and not Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny? Another simple answer&hellip; Dial of Destiny emasculated and shamed its hero with an unappealing girl sidekick, while Fast X and Guardians 3 remained true to their characters and what made them iconic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &ldquo;existential&rdquo; truth, and we all know it, is this: Ever since Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, Hollywood has sought to punish, insult, and alienate Trump voters (half the country) by way of cinematic tantrums that scold and dehumanize us due to our gender, faith, political beliefs, and overall normalcy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood&rsquo;s insane crusade against decent people (and decency) hit warp speed after the murder of George Floyd with a legion of movies where no one behaves or interacts normally. In order to push its social and political agenda, everyone&rsquo;s a simple-minded stand-in for us evil normal people or the oh-so noble BIPOCLGBTQTARDs. Disney is now &ldquo;queering&rdquo; our children. Indiana Jones is criticized as a colonialist. Luke Skywalker is a child murderer. Buzz Lightyear is a GLAAD crusader. Thor learns to wear an apron.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, movie after movie tells us sexual deviancy, mental illness, and narcissism are virtues. Worst of all, our heroes, the very characters that made these franchises golden geese for decades, are deconstructed, portrayed as bigots, and replaced with girls and racial minorities for no good reason other than tokenism. Sometimes, as the Equalizer franchise proved, there is a good reason &mdash; Denzel Washington is awesome. Mostly, though, the tokenism is so ham-handed and off-putting that the bad taste in our mouths tells us not to bother purchasing a ticket.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s no mystery here: movies suck.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Two Hikers Killed by Avalanche in the Italian Alps Near Switzerland</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two hikers on snowshoes were killed by an avalanche in the Italian Alps near Switzerland, a rescue service said Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The avalanche occurred around noon on Sunday at the 2,200-meter (7,200-foot) level in the Formazza valley in the Piedmont region, said Federico Catania, a spokesperson for Italy&rsquo;s alpine rescue service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The force of the avalanche pushed one of the victims into a lake near the bottom of the slope, while the other body was found in the mass of snow, he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite strong winds, a helicopter was able to lower a rescue team aided by a dog unit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The identities of the two victims weren&rsquo;t immediately released.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A search operation was launched after guards at a nearby dike reported seeing an avalanche strike two hikers, Catania said. An initial search by foot failed to find the hikers, prompting the use of the helicopter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A firefighters helicopter carrying divers was dispatched to recover the body from the lake, rescuers said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://americanmilitarynews.com/2024/01/iran-sends-warship-to-red-sea-after-us-sinks-houthi-boats/#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://americanmilitarynews.com/2024/01/iran-sends-warship-to-red-sea-after-us-sinks-houthi-boats/#google_vignette</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Iran sends warship to Red Sea after US sinks Houthi boats</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iran dispatched a warship to the Red Sea after the U.S. Navy destroyed three Houthi boats, a move that risks ratcheting up tensions and complicates Washington&rsquo;s goal of securing a waterway that&rsquo;s vital to global trade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alborz destroyer traversed the Bab El-Mandeb strait, a narrow choke point between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, on Monday, Iranian state media said without providing further information on the vessel&rsquo;s mission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iran&rsquo;s foray into the Red Sea a day after the U.S. action compounds a highly volatile situation in the channel that handles about 12% of the world&rsquo;s commerce. The move could be seen as a challenge to the U.S.-led maritime task force established last month to halt attacks on ships by the Tehran-backed Houthi rebels who control a swath of Yemen&rsquo;s northwest, including the capital Sanaa and the Red Sea port of Al-Hudaydah.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Houthis, in November, began attacking vessels they claimed were headed to or owned by entities in Israel in a bid to end an Israeli offensive in Gaza, after Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, staged a shock attack inside Israel on Oct. 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one month, the Houthis hijacked one container ship and launched more than 100 drone and ballistic missile attacks, targeting 10 merchant vessels involving more than 35 different nations, according to the Pentagon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Prosperity Guardian, involving the navies of the U.S. and nine other nations, swung into action from Dec. 19 and had a fierce encounter with the militants on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helicopters aboard two U.S. destroyers in the Red Sea, the USS Eisenhower and the USS Gravely, responded to a distress call by the Maersk Hangzhou as Houthis in four speedboats tried to board the vessel, according to the U.S. military. Houthi fighters ignored verbal warnings, fired at the aircraft and triggered a lethal response in which three of the boats were sunk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the Houthis&rsquo; second major shipping attack in less than 24 hours and came after Denmark announced it was sending a frigate to the Red Sea to join the U.S.-led maritime coalition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. has accused Iran of being &ldquo;deeply involved&rdquo; in the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, which Tehran has denied, but said that it understood the reason for their actions. Iran hasn&rsquo;t denied supporting the Houthis since the group ousted the internationally recognized government of Yemen in 2014.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Houthi spokesperson, Yahya Saree, confirmed the incident and said 10 of the group&rsquo;s fighters were dead or missing. He called on Yemenis, Arabs and Muslims to be &ldquo;ready for all options in confronting the American escalation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iran&rsquo;s show of force in the Red Sea coincided with a visit to Tehran by Mohammed Abdulsalam, a Houthi movement spokesperson and chief negotiator. On Monday, he met with officials at Iran&rsquo;s foreign ministry following talks with Ali Akbar Ahmadian, secretary of Iran&rsquo;s Supreme National Security Council, according to Iran&rsquo;s Nour News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian denounced what he called double standards by the U.S. and some Western governments after a telephone conversation with the U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who urged Iran to rein in the Houthis. &ldquo;Israel can&rsquo;t be allowed to massacre women and children and carry out a genocide in Gaza and set fire to the region, but consider stopping an Israeli ship in the Red Sea as endangering the security of this economic waterway,&rdquo; said Amirabdollahian.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tehran&rsquo;s moves are ultimately in the service of its own agenda of projecting power and driving Washington out of the region, says Joel Rayburn, a former US diplomat and military officer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is what the Iranian regime has always been intending to do with their outpost in Yemen,&rdquo; said Rayburn. Iran thinks it can establish itself as &ldquo;a great power sitting astride the region and its waterways.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Have you ever wondered why evangelical elites when they get a platform in The New York Times, or The Atlantic Monthly never have anything good to say about their fellow evangelicals? We have too. Turns out Andrew T. Walker, Opinions Page Editor at World Magazine is wondering why too. So, he wrote about it in National Review. Andrew is one of the editors that Chris works with regularly, and Andrew has asked him to write about it as well. So these two things led the Pugs to think aloud about it. Join them as they do.</p>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Recent videos by EndAbortionNow have focused on two approaches often taken by mainline pro-life organizations to justify their approach to abortion legislation. David looks at those approaches, as well as his own in times past, to see if they align with the gospel. He points to aspects of the gospel that would have Christians re-calibrate their perspective on this and any number of other political and electoral issues.</p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Multiple people injured in shooting at Perry, Iowa, high school</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple people were injured in a shooting at an Iowa high school on Thursday morning, authorities said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At approximately 7:37 a.m., police received reports of an active scene at Perry High School in Perry. Officers responded within seven minutes of the active shooter alarm, Dallas County Sheriff Adam Infante told reporters.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total number of victims and their status have not been confirmed. Infante said authorities are working to determine that information and that there is no further danger to the public.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The community is safe," the sheriff said. "We're just now working backwards, trying to figure out everything that happened and make notifications. There will be another update later on today."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press reported two gunshot victims were taken by ambulance to Iowa Methodist Medical Center in the state capital of Des Moines.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A law enforcement source told the AP the suspect in the shooting has died of what investigators believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infante said the shooting happened before school began.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Luckily, there was very few students and faculty in the building, which I think contributed to a good outcome in that sense," he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zander Shelley, 15, was in a hallway waiting for the school day to start when he heard gunshots and dashed into a classroom, his father, Kevin Shelley, told the AP. Zander was grazed twice and hid in the classroom before texting his father at 7:36 a.m.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Shelley, who drives a garbage truck, told his boss he had to run. "It was the most scared I&rsquo;ve been in my entire life," he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachael Kares, an 18-year-old senior, told the AP she was at jazz band practice when students heard what sounded like four gunshots, spaced apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We all just jumped," Kares said. "My band teacher looked at us and yelled, &lsquo;Run!&rsquo; So we ran."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kares said students and faculty ran out past the football field, with people yelling, "Get out! Get out!" as they ran. She said she heard additional shots while she fled, but was most concerned about getting home to her 3-year-old son.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At that moment I didn&rsquo;t care about anything except getting out because I had to get home with my son," she told the AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheriff's office, Perry Police Department and multiple federal agencies also responded to the shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities have identified a suspect but have not released their name at this time, the sheriff said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple EMS vehicles were sent to the scene at 1200 18th Street, according to public safety radio traffic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal agents from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) also said they were on the ground.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry High School belongs to the Perry Community School District, about 25 miles northwest of Des Moines. About 1,785 students are enrolled in the school district, according to its website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday was the first day of school after the winter break, according to the school's calendar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our hearts are broken by this senseless tragedy. Our prayers are with the students, teachers &amp; families of the Perry Community," Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a statement. "I have been in contact with law enforcement agencies &amp; am continuing to monitor the situation. I will be joining their press conference today."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Federal Judge Dismisses Trump Ballot Disqualification Case &lsquo;With Prejudice&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge in California on Jan. 3 dismissed a lawsuit that sought to keep former President Donald Trump off the 2024 Republican primary ballot in that state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">District Judge David Carter granted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit &ldquo;with prejudice,&rdquo; which means that it can&rsquo;t be submitted to the same court again, according to court papers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plaintiff attempted to argue that they suffered &ldquo;emotional injury&rdquo; as a result of the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, while watching the events unfold on television, on the radio, and in various publications. They then argued that the incident caused them &ldquo;severe emotional distress&rdquo; and then filed a lawsuit to keep the former president off California&rsquo;s ballot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the judge wrote that because the events occurred &ldquo;more than two years before the plaintiff&rdquo; filed suit, it was outside of the two-year statute of limitations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision by Judge Carter, a Clinton-appointed jurist who has ruled against President Trump in a separate case, was posted online by former Republican National Committee for California Chair Harmeet Dhillon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The remnants of the last California case to keep President Trump off the ballot here were dismissed today by Judge David O. Carter!!&rdquo; she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Jan. 3.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent days and weeks, a number of lawsuits have been filed in different states seeking to bar President Trump from appearing on the ballot ahead of the 2024 election. Those suits have claimed that the former president engaged in &ldquo;insurrection or rebellion&rdquo; against the United States under an interpretation of the Constitution&rsquo;s 14th Amendment&rsquo;s Section 3, which was written in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. Civil War.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least two of those challenges have seen some success in Maine and Colorado, although there has been widespread speculation that higher courts or even the U.S. Supreme Court will strike those rulings down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days before Christmas, Colorado&rsquo;s highest court ruled to keep the former president off the primary ballot in the state, which was promptly appealed to the Supreme Court. Last week, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, unilaterally decided to keep President Trump off the ballot, which also has been appealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the Supreme Court appeal, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said that &ldquo;unsurprisingly, the all-Democrat-appointed Colorado Supreme Court has ruled against President Trump, supporting a Soros-funded, left-wing group&rsquo;s scheme to interfere in an election on behalf of Crooked Joe Biden by removing President Trump&rsquo;s name from the ballot and eliminating the rights of Colorado voters to vote for the candidate of their choice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal analysts have suggested that the U.S. Supreme Court would take up those two cases and likely would rule against the plaintiffs at least on procedural grounds. However, it isn&rsquo;t clear whether the court will take up the more thorny questions presented under the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s insurrection clause.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It seems a certainty that SCOTUS will have to address the merits sooner or later,&rdquo; Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California&ndash;Los Angeles, wrote on his website last month, referring to the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other federal judges have also dismissed attempts to block the former president from appearing on ballots. In a ruling issued in late December 2023, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema wrote that the plaintiffs&mdash;two activists&mdash;who filed suit against President Trump in Virginia to keep him on that state&rsquo;s ballot lacked standing.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trans Murderer Sent to Women's Prison</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012 and 2013, a man named Steven Buchanan murdered two handymen he had hired to do some labor around his farm in Oregon. After killing them, he fed their corpses to his pigs. He was eventually discovered and arrested for the crimes. In 2015 he was convicted, with the judge telling him that he was &ldquo;a cold-blooded killer&rdquo; who &ldquo;valued pigs more than you value human life.&rdquo; Buchanan was sentenced to fifty years in prison. But then things reportedly took a turn for the strange. The killer was no longer Steven Buchanan. Instead, he was &ldquo;Susan Monica,&rdquo; claiming to be a transgender woman. As our colleague Madeline Lessman reports this week at Townhall, Monica nee Buchanan is now being housed at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, a women&rsquo;s prison located in Wilsonville, Oregon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; biological male who was convicted of murdering two men is serving a 50-year sentence in a women&rsquo;s prison, according to a report from Reduxx.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prisoner, Steven Buchanan, who goes by &ldquo;Susan Monica,&rdquo; dismembered the bodies of his victims and fed them to pigs on a 20-acre farm he owned in Oregon, Reduxx noted. Buchanan bought the farm in 1991 and killed two handymen in 2012 and 2013. In 2015, he was reportedly sentenced to a minimum of 50 years behind bars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You shot two people and fed them to your pigs,&rdquo; Judge Tim Barnack told Buchanan during sentencing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how else I can put it. You valued pigs more than you value people. It may sound harsh, but you are a cold-blooded killer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this time, we&rsquo;ve covered enough of these transgender prisoner stories that you should have already noticed a pattern emerging. There are men behaving badly who never seemed to have any problem living as men. Then, why they are facing the possibility of a long stretch in the Crowbar Motel, they suddenly &ldquo;realize&rdquo; that they are actually women trapped in men&rsquo;s bodies and they demand special accommodations. And if they live in a blue state on the West Coast, those demands are almost always met.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the details of those two killings don&rsquo;t do enough to send chills down your spine and make you realize how dangerous this guy almost certainly is (even at the age of 75), there is more. During court proceedings, the lead detective in the case told the judge that Buchanan had said he was worried that if police found &ldquo;the other seventeen&rdquo; bodies on his farm, he might never get out of jail. Police searched and did some digging, but additional bodies were not located. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not there, though. This guy is a certifiable lunatic who told the police &ldquo;I do not value human life very much.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the sort of person we&rsquo;re putting in a women&rsquo;s prison? I&rsquo;m sure some of the actual females at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility did some bad things to wind up there, though hopefully not involving feeding body parts to swine. But do they deserve to be exposed to a proven homicidal maniac who is pretending to be a woman? Townhall has been covering stories like this for a while and it never seems to end well. One trans inmate in New Jersey wound up impregnating two female inmates. (His own mother said that the trans thing was a scam allowing him access to women.) Another inmate was sexually assaulted by a trans inmate..</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/01/03/sweden-records-coldest-january-evening-in-25-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/01/03/sweden-records-coldest-january-evening-in-25-years/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sweden Records Coldest January Evening in 25 Years</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe experienced stark weather contrasts on Wednesday, with extreme cold and snowstorms disrupting transportation and closing schools in Scandinavia while strong winds and heavy rain in western Europe caused flooding and at least one death.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temperatures fell below minus 40 degrees Celsius (minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Nordic region for a second day in a row Wednesday. In Kvikkjokk-&Aring;rrenjarka in Swedish Lapland, the mercury dropped to minus 43.6 C (minus 46.5 F), the lowest January temperature recorded in Sweden in 25 years, Sweden&rsquo;s TT news agency reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extremely cold temperatures, snow and gale-force winds disrupted transportation throughout the Nordic region, with several bridges closed and some train and ferry services suspended. Several schools in Scandinavia were closed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police across most of Denmark urged motorists to avoid unnecessary trips as wind and snow battered the northern and western parts of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mild but wet and windy conditions prevailed further south, where a storm wreaked havoc in parts of western Europe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Britain, a driver died after a tree fell on his car in western England. Gloucestershire Police said the man died in the incident near the town of Kemble on Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm, which has been named Henk by the official weather services of Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, has caused power cuts, transport troubles, property damage and disruption across the U.K.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 300 flood warnings were in place across England and Wales on Wednesday, while 10,000 homes remained without power. A severe flood alert, meaning a danger to life, was announced for the River Nene in Northampton in central England. Several residents were evacuated from houseboats and caravans at the nearby Billing Aquadrome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.K.&rsquo;s rail network was hit by flooding and power cuts, with many operators reporting ongoing issues for the Wednesday morning commute into work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strongest gales in the U.K. were recorded on the Isle of Wight, just off the coast in southern England, where wind speeds reached 94 miles per hour (151 kilometers per hour).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Netherlands, police near the city of Eindhoven said strong winds may have played a role in the death of a 75-year-old man who fell off his bicycle late Tuesday as high winds lashed much of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parts of Germany were also grappling with flooding, which could be aggravated by more rain falling in the worst-affected northwestern state of Lower Saxony.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boundingintosports.com/2024/01/aaron-rodgers-says-jimmy-kimmel-is-worried-about-the-jeffrey-epstein-files-suggests-nfl-is-rigged/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.boundingintosports.com/2024/01/aaron-rodgers-says-jimmy-kimmel-is-worried-about-the-jeffrey-epstein-files-suggests-nfl-is-rigged/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Rodgers Says Jimmy Kimmel Is Worried About The Jeffrey Epstein Files, Suggests NFL Is Rigged</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers had any designs on pulling back on his opinions in the new year, think again. During an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, the 40-year-old future NFL Hall of Famer suggested late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel might be nervous about the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Oh, and he also floated the idea that the NFL is rigged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Rodgers kicked off a segment with the host by embracing a conspiracy theory that the Super Bowl logo features the colors of the teams that eventually end up playing in the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An X post by NFL Memes in September included an image that explained the theory and showed recent examples. The group also predicted that based on this theory, the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers would be facing each other in Super Bowl LVIII.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If the Super Bowl Baltimore and San Fran, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, that Super Bowl 59 emblem better have Jet green on it,&rdquo; Rodgers said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve seen that one &hellip; that&rsquo;s a real interesting one,&rdquo; Rodgers said of the conspiracy theory.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/us-national-debt-tops-34t-first-time-history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/us-national-debt-tops-34t-first-time-history</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>US national debt tops $34T for first time in history</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. national debt topped $34 trillion for the first time ever, crossing a critical milestone at a time when government spending is already under scrutiny.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national debt &ndash; which measures what the U.S. owes its creditors &mdash; hit $34 trillion as of Friday afternoon, according to new data published by the Treasury Department. By comparison, just four decades ago, the national debt hovered around $907 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;"We are beginning a new year, but our national debt remains on the same damaging and unsustainable path," said Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which advocates for fiscal sustainability.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The historic debt level comes as Congress races to finalize critical funding bills in order to prevent a government shutdown.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national debt is expected to nearly double in size over the next three decades, according to the latest findings from the Congressional Budget Office. At the end of 2022, the national debt grew to about 97% of gross domestic product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current law, that figure is expected to skyrocket to 181% at the end of 2053 &ndash; a debt burden that will far exceed any previous level.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Though our level of debt is dangerous for both our economy and for national security, America just cannot stop borrowing," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House was quick to blame Republicans on Tuesday evening for the astronomical rise in the federal debt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is the trickle-down debt &mdash; driven overwhelmingly by repeated Republican giveaways skewed to big corporations and the wealthy," Michael Kikukawa, White House assistant press secretary, said in a statement provided to FOX Business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more worrisome is that the spike in interest rates over the past year and a half has made the cost of servicing the national debt more expensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is because as interest rates rise, the federal government's borrowing costs on its debt will also increase. In fact, interest payments on the national debt are projected to be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget over the next three decades, according to the CRFB.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments are expected to triple from nearly $475 billion in fiscal year 2022 to a stunning $1.4 trillion in 2032. By 2053, the interest payments are projected to surge to $5.4 trillion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put that into perspective, that will be more than the U.S. spends on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and all other mandatory and discretionary spending programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://mynorthwest.com/3944857/rantz-homeless-fecal-matter-behind-explosion-shigella-cases-portland/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://mynorthwest.com/3944857/rantz-homeless-fecal-matter-behind-explosion-shigella-cases-portland/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homeless fecal matter behind explosion of Shigella cases in Portland</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeless people are spreading Shigella in and around downtown Portland, Oregon. Cases are now surging and could lead to a public health emergency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shigella is a highly contagious bacteria that spreads through fecal matter. It&rsquo;s usually spread when the bacteria is on someone&rsquo;s hand and then they touch their mouth, or through sex. The Portland metro saw at least 218 cases of shigellosis in 2023, with 45 cases in December alone. Many of them occurred in Old Town.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cases rise, Multnomah County Deputy Health Officer Dr. Teresa Everson is advising the public to be alert, but not panic, as the cases are not occurring in the general public. But there&rsquo;s fear in the community that that may change. The county is offering some infected homeless people free motel rooms to isolate in so they can mitigate the spread.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;These cases can occur because bathrooms, handwashing sinks and soap can be hard to access when you aren&rsquo;t housed,&rdquo; she told KGW-TV. &ldquo;And unhoused community members are at higher risk of infectious diseases in general, as they experience poorer health than the broader public.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Everson advises people living and working in Old Town to be extra vigilant in washing hands. Though, she said most of the cases appear to be a result of sexual contact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms of Shigella infection include diarrhea, stomach cramps fever and vomiting that can last anywhere from three to 10 days. It can be treated with antibiotics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it&rsquo;s rare to see this specific kind of outbreak amongst the homeless, once it spreads, it may be hard to contain since the homeless aren&rsquo;t especially hygienic with a lack of access to restrooms. But it&rsquo;s a crisis of Portland&rsquo;s own making. Permissive left-wing policies have allowed homelessness to explode in Portland, rendering the city unrecognizable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the waning months of 2023, officials finally committed to implementing a new strategy to target homelessness after public pressure forced them to accept the reality on its streets. In a long-overdue move, the city finally decided to enforce a camping ban on public property. The new policy was set to put much-needed restrictions in place, banning camping on all public property from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and limiting it during other hours. It&rsquo;s a clear message: No more overnight stays in city parks, along riverbanks or near busy streets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a judge stopped the ban from commencing after activist attorneys representing five homeless Portlanders sued the city. It&rsquo;s part of a consistent strategy to stop any homeless policies from being enforced, with Radical Left activists fighting to keep homeless on the streets where they will now spread Shigella.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle and King County experienced a similar surge in cases that were addressed in 2021 after Public Health learned that 84% of the cases hit the homeless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/japan-airlines-passenger-plane-burst-flames-tokyos-haneda-airport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/world/japan-airlines-passenger-plane-burst-flames-tokyos-haneda-airport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Japan Airlines plane bursts into flames after collision at Tokyo's Haneda airport, leaving 5 dead</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A thick plume of black smoke rose over an airport runway in Japan on Tuesday after a Japanese aircraft collided with a coast guard aircraft and burst into flames, local media reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live footage on public broadcaster NHK showed Japan Airlines passenger plane JAL-516 on a runway at Tokyo's Haneda airport with flames coming out of its windows. Shortly after, the plane was entirely consumed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coast guard aircraft pilot escaped, but the five crewmembers were killed, NHK reported. An official confirmed that a Bombardier Dash-8 Coast Guard plane was involved in the collision.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Japan Airlines spokesperson said more than 300 passengers were on board when the aircraft initially caught fire. NHK reported all 379 passengers and crew ultimately escaped from the plane.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aircraft JAL flight 516 had flown out of Shin Chitose airport in Japan to Haneda, officials said. Haneda is one of the busiest airports in Japan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All runways and services at the airport were suspended.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2024/01/02/veterans-and-service-members-demand-pentagon-accountability-for-vaccine-mandates-n2633048"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2024/01/02/veterans-and-service-members-demand-pentagon-accountability-for-vaccine-mandates-n2633048</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>'Enough Is Enough': Veterans and Service Members Demand Accountability From DoD</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying that "all internal efforts to rectify recent criminal activity within the Armed forces" have been "exhausted," more than 200 military veterans and service members signed and published a "Declaration of Military Accountability" on January 1 over the Department of Defense's its enactment and enforcement of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoking the Declaration of Independence in a declaration of their own, the current and former members of the U.S. military state that America has reached a point in its history where it is "necessary to admonish the lawless, encourage the fainthearted, and strengthen the weak" as the "affairs of our nation are now steeped in avaricious corruption and our once stalwart institutions, including the Dept of Defense, are failing to fulfill the moral obligations upon which they were founded."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the Declaration of Independence, the signers of the Declaration of Military Accountability "seek no separation" as the patriots of 1776 did from Great Britain, "but through this letter and the efforts we pledge herein, we pursue restoration through accountability."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Pentagon's enactment of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, the declaration states that "military leaders broke the law, trampled constitutional rights, denied informed consent, permitted unwilling medical experimentation, and suppressed the free exercise of religion," actions that meant "[s]ervice members and families were significantly harmed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Their suffering continues to be felt financially, emotionally, and physically," the declaration emphasizes of those affected by the DoD's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. "Some service members became part of our ever-growing veteran homeless population, some developed debilitating vaccine injuries, and some even lost their lives."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these outcomes, the declaration says "military leaders are continuing to ignore our communications regarding these injuries and the laws that were broken," calling the DoD's silence "an apparent attempt to avoid accountability."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naming a list of military leaders who "enabled lawlessness and the unwilling experimentation on service members" including "GEN Milley, ADM Grady, GEN McConville, ADM Gilday, ADM Lescher, Gen Brown, Gen Berger, Gen Smith, VADM Kilby, VADM Nowell, VADM Fuller, LTG Martin, Lt Gen Davis, MG Edmonson, GEN Williams, ADM Fagan, VADM Buck, Lt Gen Clark, MG Francis, LTG Dingle, Lt Gen Miller, RADM Gillingham, and numerous others," the declaration emphasizes that they "betrayed the trust of service members and the American people."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Their actions caused irreparable harm to the Armed Forces and the institutions for which we have fought and bled," the current and former members of the military say. "These leaders refused to resign or take any other action to hold themselves accountable, nor have they attempted to repair the harm their policies and actions have caused."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this lack of accountability, the 231 signatories to the declaration state their intention to "do everything morally permissible and legally possible to hold our own leadership accountable" because they "as service members and veterans...feel particularly responsible for the DoD and, in according with our oaths...will make every effort to demonstrate by example how an institution can put its own house in order."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signing "on behalf of hundreds of thousands of service members and the American people, while appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for guidance and purity of intention, mutually pledge to each other that we will do everything in our power, through lawful word and action, to hold accountable military leaders who failed to follow the law when their leadership and moral courage was most desperately needed," the declaration explains.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The action that will follow from the declaration, it explains, includes running for Congress and seeking appointments within the executive branch while those in active service "will continue to put fulfilling our oaths ahead of striving for rank or position."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the declaration pledges that those who have the legal authority to do so will "recall from retirement the military leaders who broke the law and will convene courts-martial for the crimes they committed." Those who become lawmakers will "introduce legislation to remove all retirement income for the military leaders who were criminally complicit, and we will ensure none serve in or retire from the Senior Executive Service."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emphasizing that fulfilling their oaths to the Constitution requires "persistent vigilance," the declaration's signers also pledge to "train those who come after us to fulfill their duty in achieving this accountability and safeguarding against such leadership failures hereafter."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While all good things come to an end, we refuse to allow our nation to go quietly into the depths of decadence and decay," the veterans and service members declare. "We promise to exhaust all moral, ethical, and legal means to restore the rule of law and will begin by attempting to hold senior military leaders accountable" in addition to fighting to enforce the Constitution and "put an end to the two-tiered justice system."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Declaration concludes: "May future generations see our efforts and, God willing, may they also be recipients of the great gift of liberty that we have had the honor of safeguarding.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/01/universities-college-course-queer-sex-bdsm-bitch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/01/universities-college-course-queer-sex-bdsm-bitch/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>&lsquo;Queering God&rsquo; And &lsquo;How To Be A Bitch&rsquo;: Here Are Just A Few Of The Craziest Courses Universities Offered In 2023</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Universities offered students in the U.S. the opportunity to enroll in many courses that push gender ideology and left-wing activism during the 2023-2024 school year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Princeton University offered a class titled &ldquo;Black + Queer in Leather: Black Leather/BDSM Material Culture&rdquo; in the Spring 2023 semester, according to the university&rsquo;s course catalog. The class will survey black BDSM culture via research available in libraries and individuals involved in the groups that participate in the culture.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;We will consider the fragility of archival engagement with these communities by surveying existing BDSM archives in research libraries, community groups,&rdquo; the course description reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Princeton made headlines in 2022 following the addition of this course to the catalog as well as &ldquo;FAT: The F-Word and the Public Body&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anthropology of Religion: Fetishism and Decolonization.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tuition at Princeton costs more than $59,000 per year and can cost more than $76,000 including housing and food costs, according to the university&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Westminster College offers a course titled &ldquo;How to Be a Bitch.&rdquo; Students are encouraged to &ldquo;unpack&rdquo; the words &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; and bossy,&rdquo; which are &ldquo;interesting but problematic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">One course offered at Wesleyan University, titled &ldquo;Queer Russia,&rdquo; offers students an overview of the influence of queer people on Russian culture, according to the university&rsquo;s 2023-2024 course catalog. The course &ldquo;focuses on gender and sexuality in exploring an alternative cultural history of Russia, which highlights its queer legacy from the nineteenth century to the present.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Wesleyan announced it would cover abortion-related costs and emergency contraception for students in the fall 2023 semester. The university charges more than $66,000 a year for tuition and nearly $20,000 for housing, according to their website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Occidental College in California offers a course titled &ldquo;Black Queer Thought,&rdquo; according to the university&rsquo;s 2023-2024 course catalog. The course critiques &ldquo;the demands of heteronormativity, white supremacy, patriarchy and capitalism.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The course also explores &ldquo;how the cultural producers in question complicate and elaborate upon the sometimes static and often U.S.-centered definitions we hold for &lsquo;Black&rsquo; and &lsquo;queer,'&rdquo; according to the course&rsquo;s description.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Southern University of Oregon (SOU) offered a class titled &ldquo;Decolonizing Transgender&rdquo; in the 2023-2024 academic year, according to the university&rsquo;s course catalog. The course examines the development of the word transgender across &ldquo;social, cultural, historical, legal, medical, and political contexts.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The course can be taken as a part of the university&rsquo;s &ldquo;Certificate in Transgender Studies,&rdquo; according to the school&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The University of Chicago offered a course titled &ldquo;Queering God&rdquo; that questions if God is queer and what queerness has to do with the concept of God. &ldquo;What does queerness have to do with Judaism, Christianity, or Islam?&rdquo; the course description reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The university made headlines for its &ldquo;Queering God&rdquo; class in July. The school also offered a class titled &ldquo;The Problem of Whiteness&rdquo; initially in December 2022 but later moved the course to the Spring 2023 semester after backlash to the course.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A course titled &ldquo;Unsettling Whiteness&rdquo; was offered by Northwestern University in the 2023-2024 school year, according to the university&rsquo;s course catalog. The course seeks to make the &ldquo;historical, political, and cultural formation of whiteness in Western modernity visible&rdquo; for analysis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Students at Northwestern hosted a speaker in April that accused Israelis of eating the organs of Palestinians. Tuition at the school for the 2023&ndash;24 academic year was estimated to be nearly $65,000 and nearly $92,000 with all expenses including books, fees, room and board, according to the university&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Davidson College offered a course titled &ldquo;Latinx Sexual Dissidence and Guerrilla Translation,&rdquo; according to the university&rsquo;s 2023-2024 course catalog. The class seeks to mix feminist, queer, body positivity and leftist activism all into one class.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Students will study the rhetorics and aesthetic strategies of feminist and queer activist collectives focused on social issues such as immigration, transgender rights, anti-racism, economic equality, anti-speciesim, body positivity, and prison abolition with a pro-pleasure, leftist perspective,&rdquo; the course description reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Westminster College, Princeton, Wesleyan, Occidental College, SOU, Northwestern, the University of Chicago and Davidson College did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation&rsquo;s requests for comments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/trump-fox-news-town-hall-snub-cnn-iowa-debate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/trump-fox-news-town-hall-snub-cnn-iowa-debate</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trump holds Fox News town hall to counter CNN Iowa debate with DeSantis and Haley</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Fox News is set to hold a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, with President Donald Trump on Jan. 10 at 9 p.m. Eastern time, a move that directly competes with CNN's Iowa GOP primary debate held on the same night at the same time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Fox News Trump event, announced on Tuesday, marks the former president's fifth time snubbing a debate matchup with his 2024 Republican rivals. He has skipped all four primary debates sponsored by the Republican National Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will co-moderate the Trump town hall for the first time since May 2020, when Trump last sat down for an interview with the pair. The Jan. 10 town hall, just five days before the Iowa caucuses, also marks Trump's return to holding counterevents during GOP debate nights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He held a competing event during the first three GOP debates, including the first one in late August, which was co-sponsored with Fox News. But the former president did not seek to take attention from his rivals during last month's fourth GOP debate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">CNN's debate on Jan. 10 required candidates to reach at least 10% in three national or Iowa polls, but only Trump, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley have met the qualifications.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Vivek Ramaswamy also announced on Tuesday he will participate in a live studio town hall with podcast host Tim Pool, as it appears he likely won't make the CNN debate qualification deadline on Tuesday. "Forget @CNN&rsquo;s fake Iowa 'debate' on Jan 10 which will be the most boring in modern history," he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. "We&rsquo;re doing a live-audience show that night in Des Moines with @Timcast instead. Won&rsquo;t hold back."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trump dominates his competitors at 62.5%, according to a RealClearPolitics poll average. DeSantis and Haley are polling at 11.2%, followed by Ramaswamy at 4.2%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The former president is seeking a strong showing in Iowa as DeSantis and Haley seek to become the dominant second place in the field. CNN's debate will be the final time before the Iowa caucuses that DeSantis and Haley will face off. Trump, meanwhile, is likely to brag about his advantageous lead during the competing town hall and denigrate his competitors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/tucker-tells-dan-bongino-that-trump-assassination-could-be-next/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/tucker-tells-dan-bongino-that-trump-assassination-could-be-next/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Tucker Tells Dan Bongino That Trump &lsquo;Assassination&rsquo; Could Be Next</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson warned in an interview with conservative commentator and author Dan Bongino that the establishment may be preparing to assassinate President Donald Trump in a desperate move to stop his political momentum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Carlson emphasized that Trump&rsquo;s political opponents are prepared to do anything to make sure the president does not take back the White House.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tucker charted out whether circumstances are accelerating toward a possible Trump assassination, which is looking more likely due to Trump&rsquo;s soaring popularity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1741572121346683017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1741572121346683017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Last year, Megyn Kelly voiced fears that the demonization of Trump could eventually lead to his assassination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During an episode of &ldquo;The Megyn Kelly Show&rdquo; on YouTube, Kelly was joined by former Secret Service agent and author of &ldquo;The Gift of Failure,&rdquo; Dan Bongino, as the pair discussed the portrayal of Trump and its potential escalation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;You heard Tucker asked Trump about it when he interviewed him,&rdquo; Kelly said, referring to an August interview between Trump and Tucker Carlson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Whether Trump is worried, whether there&rsquo;s a realistic possibility, the left is going to so meltdown as his power rises, as he rises toward a second term &hellip; that they try to do something to him, God forbid, or that they try to do something to our country,&rdquo; she added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.thefencepost.com/news/water-fight-federal-government-sues-state-of-idaho-over-water-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.thefencepost.com/news/water-fight-federal-government-sues-state-of-idaho-over-water-rights/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Water fight: Federal government sues state of Idaho over water rights</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A lawsuit brought by the U.S. government against the State of Idaho will have far-reaching implications for both how water is managed in the West and states&rsquo; rights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">According to Idaho Farm Bureau government affairs specialist, Russ Hendricks, the state of Idaho began adjudicating water rights in Idaho&rsquo;s Snake River Basin (southern Idaho) in the late 1980s. As is the case with many western states, Idaho&rsquo;s water law provides a right to the beneficial user of the water. During this adjudication process in the &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s, many ranchers considered claiming their stockwater rights on federally administered grazing allotments through the state, but were convinced by the federal government to withdraw their claims, being told that the government was prepared for a lengthy legal battle. Only a few ranchers ignored the &ldquo;strong-arming, bullying&rdquo; by the federal government, said Hendricks. So, according to Hendricks, the federal government ended up with nearly all of the stockwater rights on federal allotments in the Snake River Basin, save for those claimed by Paul Nettleton and Tim Lowry (called the &ldquo;Joyce&rdquo; case.) Those men entered what eventually was a 15-year battle with the federal government. Eventually they won their case in the Idaho Supreme Court on the simple premise that the federal government does not own cattle and therefore is not able to put the water to beneficial use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">And that brings us to the current lawsuit wherein the federal government has filed suit against the state of Idaho in federal district court, saying that they are being discriminated against. Hendricks believes this suit will have far reaching affects, not only for Idaho water users, but for any water users across the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Idaho Farm Bureau has enlisted the help of the Mountain States Legal Foundation in the legal battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The reason I bring this up - is The WEF has already announced that "water was the next crisis, everyone understands water" since "climate change was too difficult to get people to understand"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mark-seiler-robos-llc_the-wef-has-already-announced-that-water-activity-7145163060037513216-aEqk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mark-seiler-robos-llc_the-wef-has-already-announced-that-water-activity-7145163060037513216-aEqk/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The US Government Is Attempting to Seize All Water Rights for All Bodies of Water on American&rsquo;s Property in Idaho. If Residents Do Not Register For Each Body Of Water Individually By Their Timeline The State Takes Control &amp; Owns Them Forever. The "state" requires you to register your well, pond, creek or the water automatically become the "state's" property.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Now it&rsquo;s time for my favorite topic, sports! This is for my friends out in North Carolina&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Video Appears to Show Panthers Owner David Tepper Throwing a Drink at Panthers Fan</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Completions have been tough to come by this year for the Carolina, but a thrown drink from Panthers Owner Dave Tepper hit its intended receiver on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">During Carolina&rsquo;s 26-0 demolition at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars, Panthers Owner Dave Tepper appeared to throw a drink at a fan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Tepper beats a hasty retreat after tossing the drink. It was probably a good thing since the fan turned around and immediately climbed up to the opening of the suite.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The NFL has said they are &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of the incident. However, they have not said whether Tepper&rsquo;s display is actionable under the league&rsquo;s Personal Conduct Policy. Presumably, some disciplinary action will be taken against Tepper lest the league allow fans to labor under the impression that they&rsquo;re perfectly okay with their owners showing extreme disrespect for their paying customers.</span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[Contrasting Visions of Glory and Suffering: Augustinian Reflections [The Pugcast]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today&rsquo;s show looks at the topic of &lsquo;glory&rsquo; and suffering in light of the Incarnation of Christ. Tom introduces the topic and draws upon Augustine&rsquo;s early chapters of the City of God, where Augustine engages the topic of suffering and glory as he contrasts the Christian vision with Pagan (especially Roman) notions. Glenn and Chris help unpack this important topic as the gang draws out a wealth of wisdom and insight form Augustine from his encounters with various challenges to the Christian vision.</p>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>A new video by EndAbortionNow.com asserts that women who make an abortion decision should be subject to criminal penalties. Some in the video contend that not doing so denies to her the gospel.
