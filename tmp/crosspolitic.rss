   <description><![CDATA[<p>In Chapter 3 of <em>Paradise Restored</em>, David Chilton writes: &ldquo;Salvation restores man to his original calling and purpose, and guarantees that man&rsquo;s original mandate&mdash;to exercise dominion under God over the whole earth&mdash;will be fulfilled.&rdquo; Conversion is the first step in the process, not the process itself. Biblical salvation is for the whole man and the whole earth through the process of discipleship; it&rsquo;s not just about making converts.</p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/idaho-massacre-suspect-had-job-interview-with-same-police-department-that-aided-in-his-arrest?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/idaho-massacre-suspect-had-job-interview-with-same-police-department-that-aided-in-his-arrest?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho massacre suspect had job interview with same police department that aided in his arrest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Kohbeger, the 28-year-old PhD criminology student suspected of murdering four University of Idaho students in November, reportedly met with the police chief of the same department that helped track him across the country, ultimately leading to his arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The New York Times, the Washington State University student met with Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins on April 12, 2022, according to emails the publication obtained. Hours after the meeting, Kohberger followed up with Jenkins, writing "It was a great pleasure to meet with you today and share my thoughts and excitement regarding the research assistantship for public safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publication reported that the accused killer was looking to land a three-year research assistant position in public safety, which was being offered through WSU's doctorate program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Edition reported that the job description posted by the school stated that "the purpose of these positions is to support each agency through data management and analysis, and to position them for success when they seek external funding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently unknown if Kohberger landed the position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also unclear if this research role is the same position referenced in Kohberger's probable cause affidavit, which claims that he "wrote an essay when he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in the fall of 2022."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the affidavit, Kohberger "had an interest in assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technical data in public safety operations."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brutal stabbing murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, all students at the University of Idaho, led law enforcement on a cross-country chase all the way to Kohberger's hometown in Pennsylvania. According to the Post Millenial, It was the Pullman police department that collaborated with federal law enforcement in tracking the suspect after he left Moscow, Idaho.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hate-crime-hoax-idaho-police-white-power-graffiti-high-school-created-rival-hispanic-gangs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/hate-crime-hoax-idaho-police-white-power-graffiti-high-school-created-rival-hispanic-gangs</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate crime hoax: Idaho police say 'White Power' graffiti on high school created by 'rival' Hispanic gangs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Idaho police department determined that "White Power" graffiti found at a local high school was not an act of hate, but an "act of intimidation" between two "rival Hispanic criminal street gangs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At this time, detectives no longer believe the incident to be motivated by hate but rather an act of intimidation between two rival Hispanic criminal street gangs from Caldwell," the Caldwell Police Department said on Facebook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Detectives are basing this off of evidence, video, and other factors discovered in the course of the investigation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words "White Power" were found spray-painted on the side of Caldwell High School last Thursday, two days after the high school held a "Brown Pride" protest, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Tuesday protest was held in support of a student who was told to remove a hooded sweatshirt reading "Brown Pride" because other people reportedly found it "racist," the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School officials reportedly compared the phrase to a "white pride" shirt, according to the student who was told to remove the shirt, Brenda Hernandez. She ultimately turned the hoodie inside-out so the phrase could not be seen while she was on school property.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell High School principal Anita Wilson said at the time that the school has a strict dress code "compared to other school districts because Caldwell has had a gang problem before, and 'Brown Pride' is associated with gangs."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the graffiti was found Thursday, the police chief denounced what at the time appeared to be an act of hate, saying "we will not tolerate hate in our city and will ensure that whoever is responsible for this will be held accountable for their actions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, police provided an update that the graffiti vandalism is believed to be a "diversion tactic" used by one of the Hispanic gangs in the area to avoid being caught by police, and "was possibly done to exploit the recent protest at Caldwell High School."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police posted screenshots of surveillance footage from the night the school was vandalized, showing individuals wearing black masks and hoodies standing near a wall while holding what appears to be spray paint. Police said they believe two groups of four people, or a total of eight suspects, arrived in two separate cars on Thursday to graffiti the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenient Timing: Pelosi Sold $3 Million of Google Stock Weeks Before DOJ Launched Antitrust Probe</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and her multimillionaire husband sold up to $3 million in shares of Google in recent weeks&mdash;just before the Biden Justice Department launched an antitrust probe of the tech giant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pelosi sold 30,000 shares of Google from Dec. 20 to Dec. 28, according to a financial disclosure filing the former House speaker submitted to the House Ethics Committee. The Pelosis made an undisclosed profit from the investments, according to the filing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trade proved timely. On Monday, the Justice Department and attorneys general from eight states&mdash;including California&mdash;sued Google over its monopoly on the digital ad market. The lawsuit could force Google to break up its online ad business, which generated nearly $55 billion in revenue for the company in the most recent quarter. Google's stock has dropped around 6 percent since the Justice Department announced the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trades are the latest in a string of questionable transactions for Paul and Nancy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They saved roughly $600,000 in June by selling shares of microchip maker Nvidia weeks before the U.S. government placed restrictions on the company's business in China and Russia. The Pelosis have seen their fortune grow $140 million since 2008, thanks largely to Paul Pelosi's stock trades, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi's stock market charades have sparked calls for tougher regulations on members of Congress cashing in on their positions of power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) on Tuesday introduced the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act&mdash;the PELOSI Act&mdash;to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US joins Germany in sending tanks to Ukraine as Biden hails &lsquo;united&rsquo; effort</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden has approved sending 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a significant escalation in the US effort to counter Russian aggression as international reluctance to send tanks to the battlefront falls away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reversal of the US&rsquo;s previous position came after Germany confirmed it will make 14 of its Leopard 2A6 tanks available for Ukraine&rsquo;s war effort, and give partner countries its permission to re-export other battle tanks to aid Kyiv.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By agreeing to send the Abrams, the US is able to meet the demand of the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for an American commitment but without having to send the tanks immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden added: &ldquo;We remain united and determined as ever in our conviction and our cause. These tanks are further evidence of our enduring, unflagging commitment to Ukraine and our confidence in the skill of the Ukrainian forces.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&rsquo;s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy applauded Biden for the &ldquo;powerful decision to provide Abrams,&rdquo; declaring on Twitter that &ldquo;the free world is united as never before&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, the president had spoken by phone with president Emmanuel Macron of France, Scholz of Germany, prime minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy and prime minister Rishi Sunak of Britain. Biden said: &ldquo;Germany has really stepped up. The chancellor&rsquo;s been a strong, strong voice for unity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In public statements, Washington and Berlin had denied any connection between their respective decisions on tanks, although media reports said German officials had made clear in private that the Leopards were conditional on the US making a similar commitment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a minority of parents emphasize passing on their faith to children:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Christianity Today: While mental health concerns top the list of worries for parents today, and studies suggest religion is good for mental health, passing on their religious beliefs to their children is not highly prioritized by US adults with children younger than 18, new data from the Pew Research Center show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across racial and ethnic lines, overwhelming majorities of U.S. adults with children younger than 18 believe being a parent is either one of or the most important aspect of who they are as a person. But when it comes to prioritizing the passing on of their faith to their children, white Evangelicals and black Protestants are the only two Christian groups where a majority of parents prioritize this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Parents place less importance on their children growing up to have religious or political beliefs that are similar to their own. About a third (35%) say it is extremely or very important to them that their children share their religious beliefs, and 16% say the same about their children's political beliefs," Pew researchers Rachel Minkin and Juliana Horowitz said in Parenting in America Today released on Tuesday. "Republican and Democratic parents are about equally likely to say it's at least very important to them that their children share their political beliefs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data for Parenting in America Today came from some 3,757 U.S. parents with children younger than 18, which was collected as part of a larger survey conducted from Sept. 20 to Oct. 2, 2022, to better understand how American parents approach parenting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 40% of black parents and 39% of Hispanic parents in the study told researchers that it's extremely or very important to them that their children share their religious beliefs. That share is even lower among white and Asian parents where only 32% say it's important that their children share the same religion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results of a survey of nearly 10,000 young people ages 13-25 about their beliefs, practices, behaviors, relationships and mental health published last October by Springtide Research Institute in The State of Religion &amp; Young People 2022: Mental Health&ndash;What Faith Leaders Need to Know, it was found that during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, 53% of respondents reported that mental health was their biggest challenge. Yet only 34% reported being comfortable talking about their struggle with adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 57% said new spiritual practices helped them endure the pandemic and more than half (51%) said they turned to prayer. Others turned to activities like reading, yoga, the arts or being in nature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that while religion and spirituality "can be strong antidotes to much of what contributes to mental-health struggles among young people" and that "people who are religious are better off mentally and emotionally," only 35% of the respondents said they are connected to a religious community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents connected to a religious community were found to be more likely to say they are "flourishing a lot" in their mental and emotional well-being (29%) than those not connected to a religious community (20%).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents who say they are "very religious" were more likely to report that they are "flourishing a lot" (40%) compared to those who say they are not religious (17%). Respondents who are "not religious" were more than twice as likely to say they are "not flourishing" (44%) than "very religious" respondents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study appeared to confirm decades of previous research pointing to a positive relationship between religion, spirituality and mental health.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho massacre suspect had job interview with same police department that aided in his arrest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Kohbeger, the 28-year-old PhD criminology student suspected of murdering four University of Idaho students in November, reportedly met with the police chief of the same department that helped track him across the country, ultimately leading to his arrest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The New York Times, the Washington State University student met with Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins on April 12, 2022, according to emails the publication obtained. Hours after the meeting, Kohberger followed up with Jenkins, writing "It was a great pleasure to meet with you today and share my thoughts and excitement regarding the research assistantship for public safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publication reported that the accused killer was looking to land a three-year research assistant position in public safety, which was being offered through WSU's doctorate program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Edition reported that the job description posted by the school stated that "the purpose of these positions is to support each agency through data management and analysis, and to position them for success when they seek external funding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently unknown if Kohberger landed the position.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also unclear if this research role is the same position referenced in Kohberger's probable cause affidavit, which claims that he "wrote an essay when he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in the fall of 2022."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the affidavit, Kohberger "had an interest in assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technical data in public safety operations."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brutal stabbing murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, all students at the University of Idaho, led law enforcement on a cross-country chase all the way to Kohberger's hometown in Pennsylvania. According to the Post Millenial, It was the Pullman police department that collaborated with federal law enforcement in tracking the suspect after he left Moscow, Idaho.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate crime hoax: Idaho police say 'White Power' graffiti on high school created by 'rival' Hispanic gangs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Idaho police department determined that "White Power" graffiti found at a local high school was not an act of hate, but an "act of intimidation" between two "rival Hispanic criminal street gangs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At this time, detectives no longer believe the incident to be motivated by hate but rather an act of intimidation between two rival Hispanic criminal street gangs from Caldwell," the Caldwell Police Department said on Facebook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Detectives are basing this off of evidence, video, and other factors discovered in the course of the investigation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words "White Power" were found spray-painted on the side of Caldwell High School last Thursday, two days after the high school held a "Brown Pride" protest, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Tuesday protest was held in support of a student who was told to remove a hooded sweatshirt reading "Brown Pride" because other people reportedly found it "racist," the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School officials reportedly compared the phrase to a "white pride" shirt, according to the student who was told to remove the shirt, Brenda Hernandez. She ultimately turned the hoodie inside-out so the phrase could not be seen while she was on school property.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell High School principal Anita Wilson said at the time that the school has a strict dress code "compared to other school districts because Caldwell has had a gang problem before, and 'Brown Pride' is associated with gangs."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the graffiti was found Thursday, the police chief denounced what at the time appeared to be an act of hate, saying "we will not tolerate hate in our city and will ensure that whoever is responsible for this will be held accountable for their actions."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, police provided an update that the graffiti vandalism is believed to be a "diversion tactic" used by one of the Hispanic gangs in the area to avoid being caught by police, and "was possibly done to exploit the recent protest at Caldwell High School."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police posted screenshots of surveillance footage from the night the school was vandalized, showing individuals wearing black masks and hoodies standing near a wall while holding what appears to be spray paint. Police said they believe two groups of four people, or a total of eight suspects, arrived in two separate cars on Thursday to graffiti the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caldwell Chief of Police Rex Ingram lauded his department for its investigation and vowed to track down those responsible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A police spokesperson further clarified to Fox News Digital Monday that the department believes the vandalism is gang related as it is "consistent with gang activity and we&rsquo;ve identified the tagging as consistent with gangs in the area."

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">49ers' Brock Purdy receives praise for keeping his faith in the picture ahead of NFC title</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco 49ers rising star Brock Purdy is on the brink of making history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quarterback could become the first rookie to lead his team to a Super Bowl appearance. He&rsquo;s the latest rookie quarterback to guide his team to a conference championship. And while Purdy has won each of the seven games he&rsquo;s started, he&rsquo;s receiving praise for another reason &mdash; putting faith first.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former Iowa State standout has been open about his religion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rev. Franklin Graham, CEO of Samaritan's Purse and of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, was the latest to congratulate Purdy after his win over the Dallas Cowboys and noted his openness about his belief in God and Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They&rsquo;re now just one game away from the Super Bowl! In addition to being a super talented football player, I love the fact that Brock Purdy is so open about his faith in Jesus Christ," Graham wrote Monday in a Facebook post, adding that he was rooting for the 49ers to win the Super Bowl.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the days leading up to the game against the Cowboys, Purdy explained to reporters how he was just trying to stay in the moment amid all the attention swirling around him and his team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdy also opened up to Sports Spectrum in 2021 about his faith. He said that while at Iowa State, he asked God to forgive him for putting the sport he loved ahead of his relationship with God.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In some pockets of the Protestant world &lsquo;asceticism&rsquo; is a dirty word. It brings works righteousness and unbiblical acts of self-abuse to mind. But is that the whole story? Jesus said, &lsquo;When you fast&rsquo; not &lsquo;If you fast.&rsquo; In other words, it&rsquo;s expected, and there&rsquo;s a right way to do it. So, perhaps it comes as a surprise that self-denial is actually growing in popularity, and it&rsquo;s doing so outside the church. Why is it happening, and what should we think about it. Tune in for the conversation!</p>

   <title><![CDATA[Having Two Legs: Worship is Warfare [Pastor Toby’s Blog]]]></title>
   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/a3fcf1f5-9f1c-48a4-b93b-98355cba8b26/having-two-legs-worship-is-warfare.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worship is Warfare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worship is warfare. The Apostle says that we are to take up the full armor of God in order to do battle with principalities and powers in heavenly places (Eph. 6). Hebrews says that we have not come to a mountain that can be touched, but to the Heavenly Mt. Zion, the city of the Living God, to the saints made perfect, to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, whose blood speaks better things than that of Abel (Heb. 12). And from this Mountain, God shakes Heaven and Earth. He shakes all things so that what cannot be shaken will remain. God is the consuming fire that engulfs this Heavenly Mt. Zion, and therefore we worship with reverence and awe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Book of Revelation, John is granted a vision of the heavenly places by the Holy Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. And what he sees is worship in the heavenly places. He sees the elders falling down in worship. He sees the four living creatures crying Holy, Holy, Holy! He sees an eschatological vision of the purified churched, a myriad of peoples from every tongue and tribe worshiping the Lamb who was slain, and as this worship takes place, we see judgments falling on the earth. The horses of God&rsquo;s judgement riding forth, the cups of God&rsquo;s wrath poured out, and the New Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven, as a bride adorned for her Wedding Feast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the central thing we do every week is gather for worship here. We gather here in order to struggle against the principalities and powers in heavenly places.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We gather here, lifted up by the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to join the heavenly hosts of angels and spirits of just men made perfect, in order to ask God to shake everything that can be shaken, all the sin and idols that remain in us and all the sin and idols out in the world, so that we, like Moses may have the light of Christ shine on our faces, changing us from glory to glory, that we might be sent back out into the world to take dominion for His glory, asking God that His Kingdom might come and His will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Policies to Burden American Businesses With Higher Taxes This Year</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses in the United States are set to face a bigger federal tax burden in 2023 due to Democrat policies and the phasing out of Republican tax overhauls, combined with an expected raise in corporate minimum tax for billion-dollar companies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included several changes due to which businesses will face higher taxes. In addition, some of the temporary provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted under the Trump administration are set to get phased out in 2023. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the total effect of these two developments would result in additional tax increases of $115 billion for businesses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new corporate minimum tax charges a 15 percent levy on American businesses that make more than $1 billion in book income in a year for three consecutive years. As a result, the average effective tax rate on corporate income is expected to rise from 18.7 percent to 19.3 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 200 of America&rsquo;s biggest companies with more than $1 billion in profits are likely to be affected by the corporate minimum tax. They usually pay less than the 21 percent tax typically charged on firms. In addition, the minimum tax rule will also apply to foreign firms that generate over $100 billion in book income in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that meet the conditions under this new tax policy must calculate their taxes in two ways: under the 15 percent corporate minimum tax rule and the 21 percent income tax rule. They must then pay the higher tax. Businesses operating in sectors like mining and real estate are expected to be the hardest hit by this change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stock buyback tax levies a 1 percent charge on publicly traded firms when they repurchase stocks. Some experts estimate that this tax will end up forcing businesses to maintain more cash on their company books when the money could have gone for investment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategists at UBS calculate the two taxes will be a drag on company earnings this year, estimating a 1.5 percent decrease per share in firms listed on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Hawley to Propose Legislation Banning TikTok Nationwide</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said on Tuesday he will introduce legislation to ban TikTok nationwide, charging that it violates the privacy of Americans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley for years has moved to rein in TikTok.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sens. Hawley and Rick Scott (R-F) proposed legislation in March 2020 that would ban TikTok from all federal government devices, citing cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Chinese government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress passed Hawley&rsquo;s bill to ban TikTok, which was signed into law on December 29, 2022. The bill was included in the $1.7 trillion, 4,155-page omnibus spending bill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley has questioned tech executives about their companies&rsquo; potential compliance with Chinese law that could provide the Chinese Communist Party access to data that could endanger Americans&rsquo; privacy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public officials and pundits across the political spectrum have contended that TikTok amounts to a national security concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1191863214096703489"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1191863214096703489</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play 0:00-0:50</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Hawley and Scott proposed their legislation to ban TikTok on federal government devices, many states, such as Georgia, Montana, Alabama, and Iowa, have moved to ban the controversial Chinese social media app off of their state government devices.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President Mike Pence discovered classified documents in Indiana home</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Vice President Mike Pence informed Congress on Tuesday that he discovered documents bearing classified markings from his time as vice president in his Carmel, Indiana, home on Jan. 16.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the revelations that classified documents from President Joe Biden's tenure as vice president were found at the Penn Biden Center think tank and Wilmington, Delaware, Pence's team conducted searches of Pence's Indiana home and the office of his political advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his team, Pence informed the National Archives on Jan. 18 that a small number of potential classified documents were found in two small boxes. Another two boxes contained copies of vice presidential papers. The National Archives then informed the FBI, per standard procedure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence attorney Greg Jacob wrote on Jan. 18 to Acting Director Kate Dillon McClure of the White House Liaison Division National Archives and Records Administration to inform her of the papers "containing classified markings."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the documents with classified markings were discovered, they were immediately put into a safe, according to the Pence team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documents were collected by the FBI at Pence's home in Carmel, Indiana, on Thursday evening, Jan. 19. Pence was in Washington, D.C., for the annual March for Life when the FBI collected the documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence's team said that although the documents bear classified markings, the Department of Justice or the agency that issued the documents will need to make a final determination on whether the documents are considered classified or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a letter from Jacob to Chief Operating Officer William Bosanko of the National Archives and Records Administration on Jan. 22, the DOJ departed from its standard procedures that it ran with Biden when it requested direct possession of the documents on Jan. 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other documents that were not identified as potential classified documents were driven from Indiana to the National Archives in Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No classified docs were found at Pence's Advancing American Freedom office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Oversight Committee confirmed to Fox News Digital that Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., was notified by Pence's team Tuesday regarding the discovery of classified documents in his personal residence.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British MPs call for probe into massive spike in deaths</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 3,000 more Britons are dying than average on a weekly basis, and it&rsquo;s not Covid-19 that&rsquo;s responsible</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubled by national statistics showing 20% excess deaths per week, UK MPs have demanded an investigation, the Daily Mail reported on Tuesday. Unlike the last time excess deaths reached such levels, during the second Covid-19 wave, few of these deaths could be attributed to the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking before the House of Commons on Tuesday, Conservative MP Esther McVey skewered Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty for blaming the spike in non-Covid excess deaths on &ldquo;patients not getting statins or blood pressure medicines during the pandemic,&rdquo; pointing out that the monthly figures for statin prescriptions had remained constant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Where is the evidence? And if there isn&rsquo;t one, what is causing these excess deaths?&rdquo; she asked, demanding the minister &ldquo;commit to an urgent and thorough investigation of the matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour shadow public health minister Andrew Gwynne described health secretary Steve Barclay as &ldquo;part man, part ostrich&rdquo; over his refusal to confront the issue, accusing PM Rishi Sunak&rsquo;s government of &ldquo;denial and buck-passing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There were 50,000 more deaths than we would have otherwise expected in 2022,&rdquo; he told the House of Commons on Tuesday. &ldquo;Excluding the pandemic, that&rsquo;s the worst figure since 1951.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Office for National Statistics, 2,837 more people died in the second week of January than normal in England and Wales, with just 5% of those deaths being attributable to Covid-19.e</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time excess deaths were so high, during the second week of February 2021, Covid-19 deaths made up 37% of the total. Nor is the statistic an outlier &ndash; the last two weeks of December saw 21% and 20% excess deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal College of Emergency Medicine reported as many as 500 people a week are dying because they cannot receive emergency treatment in time. A record 54,532 people waited more than 12 hours in emergency departments to actually be admitted to the hospital once the decision was made to admit them, according to NHS data, and only 65% of patients were seen within four hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Whitty warned that &ldquo;postponement of elective and semi-elective care and screening&rdquo; due to lockdowns and NHS delays would result in another wave of mortality after Covid-19 had largely subsided, with undiagnosed cancers and other chronic conditions claiming a larger than usual number of victims.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrats consider wealth tax &mdash; including for people who moved out of state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California lawmakers are pushing legislation that would impose a new tax on the state's wealthiest residents &mdash; even if they've already moved to another part of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblyman Alex Lee, a progressive Democrat, last week introduced a bill in the California State Legislature that would impose an extra annual 1.5% tax on those with a "worldwide net worth" above $1 billion, starting as early as January 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 2026, the threshold for being taxed would drop: those with a worldwide net worth exceeding $50 million would be hit with a 1% annual tax on wealth, while billionaires would still be taxed 1.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide wealth extends beyond annual income to include diverse holdings such as farm assets, arts and other collectibles, and stocks and hedge fund interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is a modified version of a wealth tax approved in the California Assembly in 2020, which the Democrat-led state Senate declined to pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current version just introduced includes measures to allow California to impose wealth taxes on residents even years after they left the state and moved elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exit taxes aren't new in California. But this bill also includes provisions to create contractual claims tied to the assets of a wealthy taxpayer who doesn't have the cash to pay their annual wealth tax bill because most of their assets aren't easily turned into cash. This claim would require the taxpayer to make annual filings with California's Franchise Tax Board and eventually pay the wealth taxes owed, even if they've moved to another state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California was one of several blue states last week to unveil bills to impose new wealth taxes. The other states were Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York and Washington. Each state's proposal contained a different tax approach, but they all centered around the same basic idea: the rich must pay more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. However, he's made public statements echoing the message that wealthier residents should pay higher taxes.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British MPs call for probe into massive spike in deaths</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 3,000 more Britons are dying than average on a weekly basis, and it&rsquo;s not Covid-19 that&rsquo;s responsible</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubled by national statistics showing 20% excess deaths per week, UK MPs have demanded an investigation, the Daily Mail reported on Tuesday. Unlike the last time excess deaths reached such levels, during the second Covid-19 wave, few of these deaths could be attributed to the virus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking before the House of Commons on Tuesday, Conservative MP Esther McVey skewered Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty for blaming the spike in non-Covid excess deaths on &ldquo;patients not getting statins or blood pressure medicines during the pandemic,&rdquo; pointing out that the monthly figures for statin prescriptions had remained constant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Where is the evidence? And if there isn&rsquo;t one, what is causing these excess deaths?&rdquo; she asked, demanding the minister &ldquo;commit to an urgent and thorough investigation of the matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour shadow public health minister Andrew Gwynne described health secretary Steve Barclay as &ldquo;part man, part ostrich&rdquo; over his refusal to confront the issue, accusing PM Rishi Sunak&rsquo;s government of &ldquo;denial and buck-passing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There were 50,000 more deaths than we would have otherwise expected in 2022,&rdquo; he told the House of Commons on Tuesday. &ldquo;Excluding the pandemic, that&rsquo;s the worst figure since 1951.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Office for National Statistics, 2,837 more people died in the second week of January than normal in England and Wales, with just 5% of those deaths being attributable to Covid-19.e</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time excess deaths were so high, during the second week of February 2021, Covid-19 deaths made up 37% of the total. Nor is the statistic an outlier &ndash; the last two weeks of December saw 21% and 20% excess deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Royal College of Emergency Medicine reported as many as 500 people a week are dying because they cannot receive emergency treatment in time. A record 54,532 people waited more than 12 hours in emergency departments to actually be admitted to the hospital once the decision was made to admit them, according to NHS data, and only 65% of patients were seen within four hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Whitty warned that &ldquo;postponement of elective and semi-elective care and screening&rdquo; due to lockdowns and NHS delays would result in another wave of mortality after Covid-19 had largely subsided, with undiagnosed cancers and other chronic conditions claiming a larger than usual number of victims.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-democrats-consider-wealth-tax-people-moved-out-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-democrats-consider-wealth-tax-people-moved-out-state</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrats consider wealth tax &mdash; including for people who moved out of state</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California lawmakers are pushing legislation that would impose a new tax on the state's wealthiest residents &mdash; even if they've already moved to another part of the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblyman Alex Lee, a progressive Democrat, last week introduced a bill in the California State Legislature that would impose an extra annual 1.5% tax on those with a "worldwide net worth" above $1 billion, starting as early as January 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 2026, the threshold for being taxed would drop: those with a worldwide net worth exceeding $50 million would be hit with a 1% annual tax on wealth, while billionaires would still be taxed 1.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide wealth extends beyond annual income to include diverse holdings such as farm assets, arts and other collectibles, and stocks and hedge fund interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is a modified version of a wealth tax approved in the California Assembly in 2020, which the Democrat-led state Senate declined to pass.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current version just introduced includes measures to allow California to impose wealth taxes on residents even years after they left the state and moved elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exit taxes aren't new in California. But this bill also includes provisions to create contractual claims tied to the assets of a wealthy taxpayer who doesn't have the cash to pay their annual wealth tax bill because most of their assets aren't easily turned into cash. This claim would require the taxpayer to make annual filings with California's Franchise Tax Board and eventually pay the wealth taxes owed, even if they've moved to another state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California was one of several blue states last week to unveil bills to impose new wealth taxes. The other states were Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York and Washington. Each state's proposal contained a different tax approach, but they all centered around the same basic idea: the rich must pay more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. However, he's made public statements echoing the message that wealthier residents should pay higher taxes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The working class has shouldered the tax burden for too long," Lee wrote in a tweet. "The ultra-rich are paying little to nothing by hoarding their wealth through assets. Time to end that."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Lee, the tax would affect 0.1% of California households and generate an additional $21.6 billion in state revenue, which would go to the state general fund. California has among the highest taxes of any state in the country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates argue that the money could boost funding for schools, housing and other social programs. Perhaps more importantly, however, Lee hopes it could help address California's massive $22.5 billion budget deficit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is how we can keep addressing our budgetary issues," he told the Los Angeles Times. "Basically, we could plug the entire hole."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, experts counter that the bill will have the exact opposite effect through high administrative costs and by causing an exodus of people to flee the state.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden admin considering plan for annual Covid boosters</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering changing its Covid-19 vaccine strategy in an effort to keep up with an ever-changing virus and eliminate the old "fully vaccinated" model whereby one receives two shots of the original vaccine, followed by regular booster shots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to eliminate the original vaccines and to adopt an approach similar to the flu vaccine, where annually-updated shots are administered that match the strain that is predicted to be the most prevalent, according to a federal official who spoke to NPR under the condition of anonymity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the original approach, where a person must receive the two initial shots of the original vaccine, followed by periodic booster shots, the changes being considered would mean that a person simply receives the latest version of the vaccine in the fall that is tailored to whatever variant of the virus is predicted to be dominant over the winter, much like the formulation and administration of the flu vaccine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response from immunologists and vaccine researchers who spoke to NPR has been mixed, with some arguing that because of such low demand for, and widespread skepticism of, the updated boosters, the public appetite for continued vaccinations makes the new approach not worthwhile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic. "The public is voting with their arms if you will and said, 'No. I'm not going to get this. This doesn't make sense to us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's also a question as to whether the updated bivalent boosters offer any advanced protection compared to the original shots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Moore, an immunologist at Weill Cornell Medical College said, "We have no solid data about the performance of the bivalent boosters. "The hard evidence is lacking, and the evidence that is out there is at the very least inconclusive and to me trends towards saying the bivalent boosters were little if no better."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Paul Offit of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the FDA's advisers, who also questions whether everyone will need boosters or just those at high risk of severe infection. "We shouldn't really be chasing these variants, which are evanescent and are often gone by the time you've created the vaccine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Eric Rubin, a Harvard professor and another member of the FDA's advisory committee, says the administration needs to require more proof that the updated vaccines are actually reducing the risk of getting infected, getting sick, hospitalized and dying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA's potential plan acknowledges that the world might finally be settling into a more predictable co-existence with the virus, in much the same way we live with the flu and cold viruses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet on Thursday to discuss the future of the Covid-19 vaccine and to vote on any potential changes.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamala Harris omits Americans' right to 'life' from Declaration of Independence during abortion speech</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, Kamala Harris gave a speech in Tallahassee, Florida over abortion where she quoted the Declaration of Independence but left out the part of the document that said Americans have a right to life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3jOEg7gXLU&amp;t=7s"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;VIRAL MOMENT: Kamala Harris Leaves Out Right To Life In Quote Of Declaration During Abortion Speech&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3jOEg7gXLU&amp;t=7s&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">VIRAL MOMENT: Kamala Harris Leaves Out Right To Life In Quote Of Declaration During Abortion Speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play 0:00-1:06</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;. I won&rsquo;t&hellip; make you&hellip; listen&hellip;. To that&hellip; whole&hellip; speech!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those keeping score at home, The Declaration of Independence reads, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris did not mention the right to life as written in the Declaration throughout her 18-minute long speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Daily Mail, Harris arrived in Florida on Thursday and announced that the Biden administration planned to further extend ways to provide abortion pills to those who seek them. She also criticized Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for his pro-life views.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her speech comes on the 50 year anniversary of the now repealed Row v. Wade Supreme Court decision..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 24, in a 6-3 decision stemming from the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization the Supreme Court ruled that "The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://redstate.com/kiradavis/2023/01/22/los-angeles-rams-tells-fans-to-donate-to-democrat-anti-gun-group-following-mass-shooting-n692581"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://redstate.com/kiradavis/2023/01/22/los-angeles-rams-tells-fans-to-donate-to-democrat-anti-gun-group-following-mass-shooting-n692581</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Rams Tells Fans to Donate to Democrat Anti-Gun Group Following Mass Shooting</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tragic and reprehensible mass shooting on Saturday night, in the Los Angeles County city of Monterey Park, has prompted expressions of concern and condolences from across California and the nation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those offering condolences is the Los Angeles Rams football team. The organization took to social media to offer solidarity with the Monterey Park community and all those celebrating the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is the celebration that was happening when the violence unfolded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sentiment should have been (and is) enough (even with the gun violence bit thrown in for good measure), but in California, there is no such thing as &ldquo;too far.&rdquo; The Rams decided to push it a step further and promote the anti-second amendment group Everytown for Gun Safety, as if guns are Los Angeles&rsquo; problem, not unchecked criminal behavior and soft-on-crime policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown for Gun Safety is an anti-second amendment activist group founded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who was also the mayor of one of the most violent cities in America. It is also a Democrat political organization, having pledged over $60 million dollars to Democrat candidates in the 2020 election season. They continue to work to influence elections and elected officials toward their anti-second amendment agenda.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is all well and good. They are not secretive about their mission, nor should they be. Certainly there are plenty of people within the Los Angeles Rams organization who align with Everytown&rsquo;s values, and many fans as well. To be sure, there are also plenty of employees and fans who value their second amendment rights, and find activist groups like Bloomberg&rsquo;s quite objectionable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paired with the fact that the city of Los Angeles has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, and simultaneously some of the highest gun crime rates in the nation, it only seems like common sense that a football team might want to hold off on politicizing a tragic event and then using it to fundraise for a politically partisan group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a myriad of charities the Rams organization could have encouraged Americans to donate towards, ones that don&rsquo;t actively campaign for one political party or another. In this case it is the very political party who&rsquo;s policies and &ldquo;defund the police&rdquo; platforms have led to this rash of crime plaguing innocent Americans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Los Angeles Rams join many other professional sports teams who seem to be actively trying to repulse their most loyal fans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://mynorthwest.com/3788318/rantz-seattle-running-out-of-dead-body-storage-due-to-fentanyl-ods/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://mynorthwest.com/3788318/rantz-seattle-running-out-of-dead-body-storage-due-to-fentanyl-ods/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle running out of dead body storage due to fentanyl ODs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle&rsquo;s fentanyl overdose crisis is so bad that the King County Medical Examiner is running low on storage for dead bodies. The stunning admission was made by Seattle-King County Public Health Director Dr. Faisal Khan during a recent Board of Health meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Medical Examiner&rsquo;s Office is now struggling with the issue of storing bodies because the fentanyl-related death toll continues to climb. Obviously, they have finite space in the coolers they use and that space is now being exceeded on a regular basis,&rdquo; Dr. Khan admitted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King County has already experienced over one fatal fentanyl overdose death a day for the month of January, with 31 deaths as of Jan. 22, 2023. Last year, the county recorded 1,019 fatal overdoses, with fentanyl responsible for the majority of deaths at 686. It&rsquo;s the highest number of overdose deaths the county has ever recorded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug overdoses are straining the Medical Examiner&rsquo;s resources, forcing the county to adapt to the rise in deaths. Not only are these deaths on top of every other death handled by the county, but the area&rsquo;s population has also been growing.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Steven Crowder has collided with Jeremy Boreing and the Daily Wire. What began as what appeared to be what one friend called Crowder&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jerry McGuire Moment&rdquo; (which I admit I had to look up to understand the reference), quickly turned a bit ugly with the revelation of an apparently secret recording of a private conversation between Crowder and DW CEO Jeremy Boreing discussing differing philosophies of doing business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what follows, I would like to briefly outline the case for Crowder&rsquo;s point, and then I want to address the ethics of conversation recording.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowder&rsquo;s Point</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, Crowder&rsquo;s initial claim was that &ldquo;Big Con&rdquo; is in bed with Big Tech. Reviewing an anonymous contract offer, Crowder warned in a video that provisions for salary cuts based on censorship from Big Tech companies (such as Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) essentially leave conservative commentators out to dry on their own. Jeremy Boreing came out shortly thereafter explaining that the contract was an initial start-the-conversation offer with Crowder and he was happy to claim it as his own. Boreing argued that something like the salary cuts for losing social media platforms is necessary simply because of the math involved in the business venture. A platform like Daily Wire has to be able to count on certain amounts of revenue from social media in order to pay its partners; if that revenue dries up, they won&rsquo;t be able to pay their partners, hence the proposed pay cuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get the math, and on a purely business level, I understand why it seems like a reasonable, utilitarian proposal. There&rsquo;s nothing monstrous or insidious about that sort of deal, all by itself. However, I&rsquo;m definitely sympathetic to Crowder&rsquo;s overall point, which he claims was never about the money but simply about Big Con (Big Conservatism) standing up for free speech and pushing back against Big Tech. If we&rsquo;re going to have multi-million dollar conservative news and commentary outlets, what good are they if they are not actively pushing back against Big Tech and seeking to protect their partners from cancel culture? Maybe Jeremy Boreing thinks he&rsquo;s playing the long game, but I happen to think they are already halfway over the waterfall that will soon take them down the FOX News drain. Denise McAlister is on record claiming that she was fired from the Daily Wire for being outspoken about the sinfulness of homosexuality. Ben Shapiro reportedly told her that he didn&rsquo;t want to rock that boat because they happen to be big donors/sponsors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve also written previously that Jeremy Boreing&rsquo;s razor ad was a pretty significant faceplant: pushing back against woke cancel culture by weaponizing proto-woke motifs isn&rsquo;t a winning strategy. While I don&rsquo;t really care if Jeremy wants to joke around about being the Daily Wire &ldquo;god king,&rdquo; strutting around his offices with four boobs (two on either side of him) is what got us here in the first place. And by &ldquo;here,&rdquo; I mean that you cannot objectify women, turning them into objects to be used for &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; ends, and then complain when some men decide they would like to cut them off teenage girls or put some fake ones on themselves. I certainly grant that men lusting after women is more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; than men lusting to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">be</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">deform</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women. But that&rsquo;s like saying it&rsquo;s more natural to steal steak than trash. Stealing is still a sin, and sin is the kind of poison that always destroys and warps. Sin is insanity, and there aren&rsquo;t any brakes on that car. Why was Boreing cool with his Razor Ad? Because sex sells. It makes money. Of course, Boreing thinks he&rsquo;s making conservatism sexy, and I&rsquo;m all for the alternative economy and pushing back against woke razors. But you can&rsquo;t put a little bit of eyeliner on and insist that you&rsquo;re sticking it to the Drag Queens. Even if all your fans go along with it, that&rsquo;s still utilitarianism. Doing whatever &ldquo;works&rdquo; is not taking a sledgehammer to leftism; it&rsquo;s actually getting a sledgehammer ready for leftism.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Crowder&rsquo;s point seems legitimate to me because of Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s interview with Dave Rubin concerning his boutique, test-tube &ldquo;family.&rdquo; The atrocity of that conversation, as Peterson&rsquo;s grand welcome to the Daily Wire still astonishes me. And as I noted at the time, it was right around the same time that the Daily Wire announced that they were working on children&rsquo;s programming since Disney has gone woker than an angry Karen at a BLM rally in Seattle. Given the way Peterson handled Rubin&rsquo;s homosexuality, claims of &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; to his sodomite lover, the rented uteruses, the eggs purchased from a Sears catalogue, and his freezers full of breastmilk, I believe Jeremy Boreing and the Daily Wire also still owe the whole world an apology for presenting that steaming pile as anything close to conservative.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The juxtaposition of that interview with the announcement of children&rsquo;s programming colored me nonplussed. The same Daily Wire that had just stroked its three thoughtful philosophical chin hairs contemplating the purchase of eggs, renting of wombs, and freezers full of breastmilk would like to provide children&rsquo;s programming. At this point, they have lost all credibility (Matt Walsh&rsquo;s documentary notwithstanding) on the subject of what is a woman, a family, a marriage, children, or appropriate content.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far, my concerns with the Daily Wire, and why Crowder&rsquo;s warning that Big Con might be getting sodomized by Big Tech seems reasonable to me. Sorry, let me say it nicer. Big Tech might be buying Big Con&rsquo;s eggs and inseminating them in test tubes in order to grow good liberal citizens in the Daily Wire&rsquo;s rented womb, looking a little conservative (with cleavage like their mom), but definitely ideologically of their father.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no idea if these sorts of compromises are even on Crowder&rsquo;s radar. But I would hope they are, and if they aren&rsquo;t, maybe he has his own list of free speech compromises.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethics of Secret Recordings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, unless another shoe drops, and some massive scandal is revealed at the Daily Wire, it looks to me that Crowder made a major blunder in secretly recording a phone call he had with Jeremy Boreing about the Daily Wire business model and releasing snippets of it publicly. I think Crowder was free to talk about his concerns with the proposed contract and business philosophy, but recording someone without their knowledge or consent is an act of war. Recording someone without their knowledge or consent is to identify them as your enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because recording someone without their knowledge or consent is a form of deception. When we talk to one another, we generally assume the context of our conversations, and it is a form of deception to allow someone to assume one context (friendly, informal discussion/debate) when another is actually in mind (every word is being examined, fishing for dirt/sabotage). Of course if you want to ask for permission to record or announce that a recording is in progress for the sake of keeping a faithful record of the conversation, that is certain permissible, and can be perfectly friendly, but that openness keeps the conversation friendly because it is honest, straightforward, and not at all duplicitous. But secret recordings are duplicitous.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course in a world of modern technology, it is incredibly easy to record or be recorded. We often joke that with iPhones and Siri and Alexa, all of our homes are bugged, all of our conversations are being recorded. I mean, we&rsquo;ve all had the eerie experience of talking to someone about spatulas, and then five minutes later, scrolling on Facebook there&rsquo;s an ad for spatulas. I mean, it&rsquo;s not even very subtle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, in the ordinary course of things, when you call someone up on the phone or go to coffee with them, even when you&rsquo;re negotiating a potential business deal, good faith, means, well, good faith. It means that while people certainly may have multiple loyalties and responsibilities to juggle, what is being discussed and debated is what is being discussed and debated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a pastor, I&rsquo;ve had situations where an aggrieved spouse has secretly recorded conversations or arguments with their spouse. While I can sympathize with the instinct (e.g. I want my pastor to hear exactly what she/he sounds like in private), unless we are talking about actual criminal activity that needs to be taken to the police, it is almost always like pulling out a nuke at a fist fight. Don&rsquo;t do it. While a relationship can be severely strained by arguments, losing tempers, harsh words, people do not understand the damage that can be done by duplicity, by deceptive recording. It is one thing to simply disagree, to disagree vehemently. It is another thing to submarine all trust.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A brother offended</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is harder to be won</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than a strong city: and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">their</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contentions</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the bars of a castle&rdquo; (Prov. 18:19).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only other category the Bible admits would be lies/deception that trick people into doing the right thing. We see this with Jacob and Rebecca deceiving Isaac, tricking him into obeying God and giving Jacob the blessing. Tamar, the daughter in-law of Judah, deceives her father in-law into providing for her, and there are some court intrigues under David, where Joab sends the wise old woman in to plead before David, and later, even Bathsheba&rsquo;s plea for the throne for Solomon included some sleight of hand, calculated to prod David to do what needed to be done. But that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be what is going on in the Crowder/Daily Wire collision. This appears to me to be a legitimate conflict of visions and principles that got personal. The collision would have already made the personal relationships that existed more strained as it is, but I think Crowder&rsquo;s decision to record a private conversation and release excerpts of that conversation needlessly punched below the belt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I have sympathy for Crowder&rsquo;s concerns, and structurally, I actually agree that Daily Wire has a business model that will long term suck them into the big money liberal vortex (if it hasn&rsquo;t already). While many of the players and contributors have personal principles of conservatism (which I&rsquo;m very grateful for!), the fundamental ideology governing the business model is a right-leaning libertarianism and utilitarianism, which is ultimately a humanistic cancer in our society. It&rsquo;s great to have the libertarians as co-belligerents against bloated, overweening government, and on many policies, we can agree, since biblical conservatism really does envision a small, limited civil government and great freedom for individuals, families, and associations. But if we do not have a structural commitment to the biblical principles of liberty (freedom from the coercion of Big Tech, crony capitalism, etc.), it will not last long.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*And for the same reason, I would urge Crowder to admit that the secret recording was below the belt, unethical, unkind, and apologize. If he really believes in conservative values, then that would prove it.*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, as it stands, it appears that Crowder has employed some of the same utilitarian worldview in the name of conservatism and calls his whole complaint into question, and that would explain why Republicans and conservatives in general can&rsquo;t have nice things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One last thought: some of you may wonder why it wouldn&rsquo;t be ethical to consider Daily Wire an enemy since they already appear to be so compromised on homosexuality and eugenics. Well, I would grant that someone might conclude that (although I don&rsquo;t, since folks like Walsh and Knowles seem to be holding a principled biblical line, albeit as Roman Catholics), but even if someone has concluded that they are enemies, I think good faith includes the honor of actually declaring war. Don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re still friends despite this disagreement and then stab your &ldquo;friend&rdquo; in the back publicly. That isn&rsquo;t good faith. If you&rsquo;ve concluded that your former friends are not friends anymore but actually enemies, then say so. Tell them directly. Then feel free to record every conversation you have. In this world there will be fights, and there will be wars, but we are Christians, and so we believe in just wars and clean fights.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Supreme Court Report Fails to Identify Leaker of Roe v. Wade Draft Opinion</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court released a report stating that, after a months-long internal investigation, the leaker of a draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade last year couldn&rsquo;t be identified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leak shattered the image of the Supreme Court, which has long prided itself on maintaining proper decorum and on keeping as confidential the deliberations of the justices in cases argued before the court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day after the leak, Chief Justice John Roberts said there would be an investigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite his assurances, the unprecedented leak reportedly caused internal disruptions at the court and changed the atmosphere behind-the-scenes while giving rise to rampant speculation about the motives of the leaker or leakers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some said the leak was intended to generate a public backlash that would intimidate the conservative justices into leaving Roe intact, while others speculated that it was calculated to pressure the conservative justices, who had already signaled a willingness to reverse Roe, to stay the course and actually do it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court justices, including Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote both the draft and published versions of the opinion, previously described the leak of the document as a &ldquo;grave betrayal.&rdquo; In recent months, various justices said an update on the progress of the investigation was coming, but no updates followed until the formal release of the report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leak was followed by months of raucous protests at the homes of the conservative justices in Maryland and Virginia, targeted harassment of justices in public by left-wing activists, and angry words in Congress. One man was arrested and charged with plotting to kill Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report (pdf) on Supreme Court Marshal Gail Curley&rsquo;s investigation was issued midday on Jan. 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court ruled on June 24, 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization that there&rsquo;s no constitutional right to abortion, overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 precedent that legalized abortion nationwide. The Dobbs ruling returned the regulation of abortion to the states.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five conservative justices voted to reverse Roe. Roberts, also considered a conservative, voted to uphold the restrictive Mississippi abortion law in question but wrote that he wouldn&rsquo;t have overturned Roe. Three liberal justices issued a strongly worded joint dissent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, an early version of the draft majority opinion in Dobbs made its way to the media, a first-of-its-kind leak of a full high court opinion. Politico published the draft document, dated Feb. 10, 2022, on May 2, 2022, without disclosing its source. In the end, the draft document wasn&rsquo;t much different than the official published opinion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation itself is continuing, according to the report.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump 'probably coming back to Twitter'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump is looking to return to Twitter and Facebook. Trump, whose account was reinstated following the purchasing of Twitter by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, has stuck to his own platform, Truth Social, despite his account's unsuspended status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Republican with knowledge of private discussions on Trump's potential return to Twitter, who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity, said, "Trump is probably coming back to Twitter. It&rsquo;s just a question of how and when. He&rsquo;s been talking about it for weeks, but Trump speaks for Trump, so it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess what he&rsquo;ll do or say or when."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another person close to Trump told the outlet that Trump has sought input on his potential return to Twitter for weeks, and that his campaign advisors have been workshopping ideas for his first Tweet on the platform in over 2 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Trump advisors said that the 2024 presidential hopeful could be limited in posting to other social media platforms since he founded Truth Social. A spokesman for Trump told NBC though that the campaign believes he would be able to return to Twitter as before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump was banished from the popular social media platform on January 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol riot on January 6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump previously said that he would not be returning to the platform and that he would stick to Truth Social.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Truth Social is through the roof," he said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talks of Trump's potential return to Twitter comes as Trump's campaign has petitioned for his Facebook account to be reinstated, as the account nears the end of it's two-year suspension. The Facebook ban, enacted on January 7, 2021, was for an initial period of two years, after which it would come up for review.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-alec-baldwin-to-be-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-fatal-rust-shooting?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-alec-baldwin-to-be-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-fatal-rust-shooting?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alec Baldwin to be charged with involuntary manslaughter in fatal Rust shooting</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, prosecutors announced that they will charge Alec Baldwin and armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed with two counts each of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on Baldwin&rsquo;s Rust set.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of the charge comes over two years after Alec Baldwin shot and killed 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza with a live round from a prop gun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CBS News National Correspondent Kris Van Cleve, Assistant Director David Hall "has signed a plea agreement for the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon. The terms include a suspended sentence and six months probation."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No charges were filed in connection to the shooting of Rust director Joel Souza, who was injured but survived.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement from New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, she stated that her office will file criminal charges against the two by the end of the month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involuntary manslaughter is a fourth-degree felony in the state of New Mexico, and carries an 18-month jail sentence and a $5,000 fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carmack-Altwies noted that "The other charge is involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a lawful act," which is also a fourth-degree felony carrying the same sentencing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Baldwin had said in an interview with George Stephanopolous that he "didn&rsquo;t pull the trigger," but a later FBI analysis concluded that he did in fact pull the trigger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was found that the prop gun had been loaded with live rounds, and that the gun had misfired multiple times leading up to the fatal shooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April of 2022, New Mexico&rsquo;s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau fined Rust Movie Productions $136,793, the maximum possible fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bureau also reportedly issued a "scathing narrative of safety failures in violation of standard industry protocols," which included testimony that the production&rsquo;s managers took little to no action to address two previous misfires leading up to the fatal October shooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also documented numerous gun safety complaints brought forth by crew members that they say went unnoticed, and said that weapons specialists were not allowed to make decisions regarding additional safety training.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production&rsquo;s head armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, had previously had a number of complaints lodged against her in regard to concerns over her careless handling of weapons. Gutierrez-Reed and her assistants had also been allegedly been playing with weapons on the set of Rust. Hutchins had reportedly been advocating for safer conditions for her team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November of 2022, Baldwin launched a lawsuit against several crew members of the film for reckless and dereliction of duty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit named Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the chief armorer, Assistant Director Dave Halls, Prop Master Sarah Zachry and Seth Kenney, the gun supplier.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous month, Baldwin settled with Hutchins&rsquo; family in a wrongful death suit. As part of the agreement, Matthew Hutchins, Halyna&rsquo;s widower, will act as an executive producer when the film resumes production.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2022, it was revealed that Rust would resume production in January, but the production would not resume in New Mexico, according to Variety.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sister Andr&eacute;, world's oldest person, dies at age 118</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucile Randon, the French nun who was the world's oldest living person and the oldest person to survive COVID-19, died in her sleep on Tuesday, Jan. 17, at the Sainte-Catherine-Laboure nursing home in the town of Toulon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randon was less than a month away from celebrating her 119th birthday, multiple outlets reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born on Feb. 11, 1904, Randon worked as a teacher, governess and child care provider before becoming a Catholic nun in 1944.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After becoming a nun, Randon took the name "Sr. Andr&eacute;."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randon was declared to be the "oldest person living (female)" and "overall oldest person living" following the death of 119-year-old Kane Tanaka of Japan on April 19, 2022, according to Guinness World Records.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her life, Randon spent nearly 30 years working with orphans and the elderly at a hospital in Vichy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randon told Guinness World Records that she enjoyed eating chocolate and other sweets as a "guilty pleasure" and had a glass of wine each day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also credited her long life to hard work, telling French media in 2022 that she worked until she was 108 years old.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randon was what's known as a "supercentenarian" &mdash; someone who lives over the age of 110.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world's eight verified oldest living people are all women, according to the Gerontology Research Group's website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four of the top eight were born in Japan, three were born in the United States, one was born in France and one was born in Brazil.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft, Amazon and other tech companies have laid off more than 60,000 employees in the last year</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The job cuts in tech land are piling up, as companies that led the 10-year bull market adapt to a new reality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft said Wednesday that it&rsquo;s letting go of 10,000 employees, which will reduce the company&rsquo;s headcount by less than 5%. Amazon</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;also began a fresh round of job cuts that are expected to eliminate more than 18,000 employees and become the largest workforce reduction in the e-retailer&rsquo;s 28-year history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The layoffs come in a period of slowing growth, higher interest rates to battle inflation, and fears of a possible recession next year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the major cuts in the tech industry so far. All numbers are approximations based on filings, public statements and media reports:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft: 10,000 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft is reducing 10,000 workers through March 31 as the software maker braces for slower revenue growth. The company also is taking a $1.2 billion charge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive,&rdquo; CEO Satya Nadella announced in a memo to employees that was posted on the company website Wednesday. Some employees will find out this week if they&rsquo;re losing their jobs, he wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon: 18,000 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Amazon</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;CEO Andy Jassy said the company was planning to lay off more than 18,000 employees, primarily in its human resources and stores divisions. It came after Amazon said in November it was looking to cut staff, including in its devices and recruiting organizations. CNBC reported at the time that the company was looking to lay off about 10,000 employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company&rsquo;s global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce: 7,000 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce is cutting 10% of its personnel and reducing some office space as part of a restructuring plan, the company announced Jan. 4. It employed more than 79,000 workers as of December.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to employees, co-CEO Marc Benioff said customers have been more &ldquo;measured&rdquo; in their purchasing decisions given the challenging macroeconomic environment, which led Salesforce to make the &ldquo;very difficult decision&rdquo; to lay off workers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce said it will record charges of $1 billion to $1.4 billion related to the headcount reductions, and $450 million to $650 million related to the office space reductions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta: 11,000 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook parent Meta</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;announced its most significant round of layoffs ever in November. The company said it plans to eliminate 13% of its staff, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s disappointing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022 wiped out one-fourth of the company&rsquo;s market cap and pushed the stock to its lowest level since 2016.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech giant&rsquo;s cuts come after it expanded headcount by about 60% during the pandemic. The business has been hurt by competition from rivals such as TikTok, a broad slowdown in online ad spending and challenges from Apple&rsquo;s iOS changes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter: 3,700 jobs cut</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after closing his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in late October, new owner Elon Musk cut around 3,700 Twitter employees, according to internal communications viewed by CNBC. That&rsquo;s about half the staff. Since then, significantly more employees have quit after Musk changed some policies around working from home and wrote that he expected all employees to commit to a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; work environment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet on Nov. 4, Musk said there was &ldquo;no choice&rdquo; but to lay off employees as the company was losing $4 million per day.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia Flyers&rsquo; Ivan Provorov Stands By His Faith, Refuses To Wear LGBTQ+ Pride Night Jersey</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent match between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Anaheim Ducks, one member of the Flyers did not wear the Pride Night themed rainbow warmup jersey meant to show support for the LGBTQ+ movement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensemen Ivan Provorov, a religious Christian and part of the Russian Orthodox Church, abstained from taking part in the compulsory-endorsement of beliefs that go against his faith. For his refusal, the Flyers put out a politically correct response before the online mob descended on them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reports of Provorov&rsquo;s refusal to wear the Pride Night jersey were confirmed by head coach John Tortorella, who unlike the statement released by the unnamed team spokesperson, praised the player for standing by his faith instead of throwing him under the bus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provorov did speak with the media where he affirmed his position not to take part in the LGBTQ+ propaganda.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Interpreting the Bible properly requires a familiarity with the entire canon of Scripture, both the Old and New Testaments. Nowhere does biblical interpretation get more fantastic (and weird) than in the area of Bible prophecy. In this episode, Gary continues talking about David Chilton&rsquo;s book, <em>Paradise Restored</em>, and how it points us in the right direction of interpreting the Bible on its own terms.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CLUB PORTAL CONTENT - Martin Luther King Jr. &ndash; A Wrongfully Religious Saint For The Right &amp; The Left </span><strong>0:10-2:31</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/holiday-2022-sales-fall-short-of-expectations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/holiday-2022-sales-fall-short-of-expectations.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday sales fall short of expectations, set stage for tougher 2023 for retailers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday sales came in below industry expectations, as shoppers felt pinched by inflation and rising interest rates, according to data from the National Retail Federation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales during November and December grew 5.3% year over year to $936.3 billion, below the major trade group&rsquo;s prediction for growth of between 6% and 8% over the year prior. In early November, NRF had projected spending of between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retail sales number excludes spending at automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants, and is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. It covers the period from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holiday sales gains include the impact of inflation, which drives up total sales. The consumer price index, which measures the cost of a broad mix of goods and services, was up 6.5% in December compared with a year ago, according to the Labor Department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For retailers, the shopping season&rsquo;s results reflect the challenges ahead. As Americans continue to pay higher prices for groceries, housing and more month after month, they are racking up credit card balances, spending down savings and having fewer dollars for discretionary spending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, retailers are following years of extraordinary spending. During the Covid pandemic, Americans fought boredom and used stimulus checks by buying loungewear, throw pillows, kitchen supplies, home theater systems and more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That translated to sharp year-over-year jumps in retail sales in the past two holiday seasons &mdash; a 14.1% gain in 2021 and 8.3% gain in 2020. On average, holidays sales have grown by 4.9% annually over the past decade, according to NRF.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NRF Chief Executive Matt Shay said those upward leaps were unsustainable, especially as people return to commuting, going out to dinner and booking vacations again. Plus, he said, Americans are paying higher prices across the board, from pricier rents to more expensive groceries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales rose in most major retail categories during the holiday season. Online and nonstore sales saw the biggest year-over-year gains, jumping 9.5% during the holiday season. Sales at grocery and beverage stores, which have had significant price increases, rose 7.8% versus the year-ago period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand in some categories noticeably weakened. Sales at furniture and home furnishings stores declined 1.1% and sales at electronics and appliances stores dropped 5.7% year over year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailyfetched.com/climate-group-turns-on-world-economic-forum-after-hundreds-of-private-jets-fly-into-davos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailyfetched.com/climate-group-turns-on-world-economic-forum-after-hundreds-of-private-jets-fly-into-davos/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate Group Turns on World Economic Forum after Hundreds of Private Jets Fly into Davos</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenpeace torched the World Economic Forum attendees for traveling to Davos, Switzerland, in a scathing rebuke of the Klaus Schwab run event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a newly released analysis commissioned by Greenpeace found, approximately 1,040 private jets flew in and out of airports servicing Davos during last year&rsquo;s World Economic Forum conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those jets, most were embarking on short-haul flights of less than 500 miles that &ldquo;could have easily been train or car trips.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One plane carried its passengers a mere 13 miles to attend the event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis, conducted by Dutch environmental consulting firm CE Delft, also revealed that the number of arrivals and departures out of Davos airports included neighboring countries such as Germany, France, and Italy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research concluded that private jet travel in the WEF &ldquo;Great Reset&rsquo; event in 2021 produced carbon emissions equivalent to those caused in one week by 350,000 cars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private jet emissions linked to Davos quadrupled during the week of the event compared to weeks before and after the meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WEF&rsquo;s theme for 2023 is &ldquo;Cooperation in a Fragmented World,&rdquo; which involves &ldquo;how we can tackle the numerous and interlinked challenges the world is facing and find solutions through public-private cooperation,&rdquo; the organization&rsquo;s press release said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klaus Schwab said in his opening remarks that &ldquo;investing into a greener and therefore more sustainable economy&rdquo; is one of the main objectives of the conference attendees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also confirmed during her remarks that policymakers would endeavor to &ldquo;reach net zero&rdquo; carbon emissions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Member states of the European Union which rely on fossil fuel production to combat climate change, were forced to scramble for new power supplies after the Nord Stream pipeline attack and Russia&rsquo;s severing reserves.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of the World Economic Forum</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WEF 'Danger of Disinformation' Panel: Hate Speech Laws Coming to the US</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One participant in the World Economic Forum's panel on "The Clear and Present Danger of Disinformation" at their annual meeting in Davos on Tuesday had a chilling prediction for hate speech laws in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel, hosted by former CNN host Brian Stelter, also featured Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) and Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission Vice President for Values and Transparency Věra Jourov&aacute;, who is from the Czech Republic, said there are reasons why many parts in Europe have strong speech code laws and the United States could soon have them too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Illegal hate speech, which you will have soon also in the U.S., I think that we have a strong reason why we have this in the criminal law," Jourov&aacute; said. "We need to the platforms to simply work with the language and to identify such cases."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sulzberger said overall disinformation is "the most existential" challenge and whatever problems with reporting stories inaccurately, the New York Times has made corrections.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taliban reportedly buying blue checks on Twitter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought things on Twitter were getting a bit weird since Elon Musk took over, buckle up. The strangeness continues this week. There has been quite a debate taking place over Musk&rsquo;s decision to revamp the &ldquo;verification&rdquo; system and sell checkmarks of various colors to anyone who requests one and is willing to fork over a small monthly payment. Plenty of people have been taking advantage of that offer, gaining some amplification of their tweets and other user options not available to the hoi polloi. So perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t have been all that surprised to learn that high-ranking officials from the Taliban have gotten in on the action, but it still certainly sounds disturbing at first glance. (BBC)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taliban have started using Twitter&rsquo;s paid-for verification feature, meaning some now have blue ticks on their accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the blue tick indicated &ldquo;active, notable, and authentic accounts of public interest&rdquo; verified by Twitter, and could not be purchased. But now, users can buy them through the new Twitter Blue service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least two Taliban officials and four prominent supporters in Afghanistan are currently using the checkmarks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the terrorist officials who now has a blue check is Hedayatullah Hedayat, the head of the Taliban&rsquo;s department for &ldquo;access to information.&rdquo; He is definitely on Twitter with more than 180,000 followers and he tweets regularly. But I don&rsquo;t see a checkmark of any color by his name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gravity Jack Conference:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over to China&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/chinas-first-population-drop-in-six-decades-sounds-alarm-on-demographic-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/chinas-first-population-drop-in-six-decades-sounds-alarm-on-demographic-crisis</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s population fell last year for the first time in six decades, a historic turn that is expected to mark the start of a long period of decline in its citizen numbers with profound implications for its economy and the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country&rsquo;s National Bureau of Statistics reported a drop of roughly 850,000 people for a population of 1.41175 billion in 2022, marking the first decline since 1961, the last year of China&rsquo;s Great Famine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That possibly makes India the world&rsquo;s most populous nation. U.N. experts predicted last year India would have a population of 1.412 billion in 2022 though they did not expect the South Asian nation to overtake China until this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India, however, only collects population figures every 10 years and its latest census, originally scheduled for 2021, has been delayed due to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term, U.N. experts see China&rsquo;s population shrinking by 109 million by 2050, more than triple the decline of their previous forecast in 2019.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s caused domestic demographers to lament that China will get old before it gets rich, slowing the economy as revenues drop and government debt increases due to soaring health and welfare costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the country&rsquo;s shrinking labor force and downturn in manufacturing heft would further exacerbate high prices and high inflation in the United States and Europe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s birth rate last year was just 6.77 births per 1,000 people, down from a rate of 7.52 births in 2021 and marking the lowest birth rate on record.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of Chinese women of childbearing age, which the government defines as aged 25 to 35, fell by about 4 million, Kang said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The death rate, the highest since 1974 during the Cultural Revolution, was 7.37 deaths per 1,000 people, which compares with a rate of 7.18 deaths in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the demographic downturn is the result of China&rsquo;s one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015 as well as sky-high education costs that have put many Chinese off having more than one child or even having any at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-child policy and a traditional preference for boys have also created a deep gender imbalance. The latest data shows China with around 722 million males compared to 690 million females. The imbalance, which is more pronounced in rural areas, has led to fewer families being formed in recent years.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrest of 'last godfather' deals new blow to ailing Sicilian mafia</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ROME &mdash; The arrest of Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro deals a powerful blow to the mythology of the Cosa Nostra, toppling a symbol of the group&rsquo;s resistance to police efforts to break up organized crime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messina Denaro, 60, was Italy&rsquo;s most wanted mafia boss and had been on the run for three decades. He had been sentenced in absentia to a life term for his role in the 1992 murders of anti-mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His arrest comes almost 30 years to the day after police caught Salvatore &ldquo;Toto&rdquo; Riina, Cosa Nostra&rsquo;s biggest figure of the 20th century, and marks the last step in efforts to dismantle the group&rsquo;s historical clan leadership.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts describe Cosa Nostra, its fame amplified by movies such as &ldquo;The Godfather,&rdquo; as an ailing crime group facing several difficulties, including competition in the highly lucrative drugs market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Cosa Nostra retains control of its Sicilian territory and a capacity to infiltrate the broader economy, it has been supplanted by groups such as the Calabrian &lsquo;Ndrangheta in the drugs trade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration in a court hearing on Jan. 17 urged judges on a federal appeals court to overturn a ruling from a lower court that struck down the administration&rsquo;s airplane mask mandate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; to impose the mandate and bypass the notice- and comment period required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Brian Springer, an attorney for the government, told judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time the mandate was imposed, in early 2021, &ldquo;there were variants that had just been detected that showed signs of increased transmissibility, and people were starting to travel again,&rdquo; Springer said. &ldquo;In those circumstances, the CDC had good cause to issue this order, particularly when the CDC detailed the reasons why in this particular environment, namely in the transportation sector and in transportation settings, COVID had a specific tendency to spread among people who are traveling together because they&rsquo;re standing together in lines and sitting together on conveyances.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the judges expressed skepticism with the line of thinking, accusing the CDC of issuing &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; language to impose the mandate without a notice and comment period. Under a ruling in a separate case, boilerplate statements that COVID-19 exists and that there&rsquo;s a public emergency aren&rsquo;t sufficient to satisfy the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; exception to the APA. Springer disagreed, saying the CDC&rsquo;s statement provided rationale that met the standard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, a Trump appointee, said in her 2022 ruling that the CDC violated the APA by only issuing a single conclusory sentence to support ducking the notice requirements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted that at the time the order was issued, around a year had passed since the beginning of the pandemic, and COVID-19 cases in America were on the decline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brent Hardaway, arguing for Health Freedom Defense Fund, which brought the case, said that the mandate was &ldquo;very strange&rdquo; given that airplanes and many airports already had mandates in place, in addition to the decline in cases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other portions of the hearing went over arguments as to whether the CDC has the authority to mandate masks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. code gives the federal government the power to enforce regulations judged as &ldquo;necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government, to enforce such measures, &ldquo;may provide for such inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, destruction of animals or articles found to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous infection to human beings, and other measures, as in his judgment may be necessary,&rdquo; the statute says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In striking down the CDC&rsquo;s moratorium on evictions, the Supreme Court found that the agency overstepped the authority outlined in the law. But the court also said the law empowered the CDC to impose measures that &ldquo;directly relate to preventing the interstate spread of disease by identifying, isolating, and destroying the disease itself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study Finds Journalists Are Now among the Most Distrusted Groups in the World</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Edelman Trust Barometer, more than two-thirds of respondents worried that journalists and reporters are &ldquo;purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the groups presented, the percentage of journalists is the highest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings also show that the percentage is the highest among the groups presented, with one percentage point above government leaders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newest finding is eight points higher than last year, proving that people are rapidly losing trust in the media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when the question was phrased differently, journalists fared slightly better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the groups presented, Government leaders ranked the lowest at 42%, with journalists coming in second with 46%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most trusted groups were scientists and fellow coworkers, at 75% and 74%, respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new findings reflect the gorwing lack of trust in media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those surveyed, 46% said media divided society, compared to just 35% who said media are a unifying force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also concerns about the weaponization of fake news, with over three-quarters of respondents saying they were concerned about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Ronald Reagan extolled the central role of the media in American democracy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Since the founding of this nation, freedom of the press has been a fundamental tenet of American life,&rdquo; Reagan said on Oct. 6, 1983.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There is no more essential ingredient than a free, strong, and independent press to our continued success in what the Founding Fathers called our &lsquo;noble experiment&rsquo; in self-government.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the media has changed a lot since then, becoming an entity that is no different from a Government lobbyist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/illinois-counties-not-enforce-assault-weapon-ban"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/illinois-counties-not-enforce-assault-weapon-ban</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 70 Illinois counties say they will not enforce state 'assault weapon' ban: Report</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois sheriffs of almost 80 counties are refusing to enforce the state's " assault weapons " ban that was recently signed into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker .</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pritzker signed the Protect Illinois Communities Act into law on Jan. 10, which bans the distribution and sale of "assault weapons," high-capacity magazines, and switches in Illinois. Those who own such guns are expected to register them with Illinois State Police by Jan. 1, 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, at least 74 sheriff's departments have publicly stated they will not enforce the ban, stating it infringes on the Second Amendment, according to ABC News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards County Sheriff Darby Boewe wrote in a statement that part of his duty is to protect the right to keep and bear arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The right to keep and bear arms for defense of life, liberty, and property is regarded as an inalienable right by the people," Boewe wrote. "Therefore, as the custodian of the jail and chief law enforcement officer for Edwards County, that neither myself or my office will be checking to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the State, nor will we be arresting or housing individuals that have been charged solely with noncompliance of this act."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement was drafted by Illinois Sheriffs' Association Executive Director Jim Kaitschuk, according to ABC News, and sent out to sheriff's departments to use or make edits if desired.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DuPage, Sangamon, and Iroquois counties are among the 74 departments that have released similarly modified statements. Iroquois County Sheriff Clinton Perzee said he would not use his jails to detain people exercising their civil rights, according to the Lake and McHenry County Scanner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an event in Quincy on Jan. 12, Pritzker told the crowd that law enforcement needs to enforce the law or leave the field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several counties have reportedly designated themselves "Second Amendment sanctuary cities," something that Pritzker dismissed at the Quincy event.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Good Things Will Happen&rsquo;: Brendan Fraser Chokes Up After Critic&rsquo;s Choice Win</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the peak of his success, being one of the highest-paid actors of the time for blockbusters like The Mummy, George of the Jungle and Bedazzled, Fraser completely disappeared from the movie scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the movie was all action-packed fun with Fraser portraying the tough and oh so handsome Rick O&rsquo;Connell, the actor suffered several major injuries during the shooting of the three films. During the filming of The Mummy in 1999, Fraser was almost choked to death during his hanging scene in the opening of the movie, as per The Things. His co-star Rachel Weisz recalled that he stopped breathing and even needed CPR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was just one mishap. The injuries he received from the ancient Egyptian-themed films led to multiple surgeries including a laminectomy, a back procedure to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves; a partial knee replacement; more back surgeries to bolt compressed spinal pads together; vocal cord repair and other procedures, as per People magazine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as his professional life took a hit, his private life also resulted in a blow when his ex-wife, Afton Smith, split from him in 2007. Fraser was then required to pay around US$900,000 for child support, as per the New York Post. Six years after the divorce, Fraser allegedly asked the court to reduce the payment as he said he was no longer able to afford the hefty sum due to lack of work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward to today&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraser broke down in tears during his acceptance speech during Sunday evening&rsquo;s Critic&rsquo;s Choice Awards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraser was nominated for his performance as Charlie &mdash; a morbidly obese teacher who was attempting to repair his damaged relationship with his daughter (played by Sadie Sink) while eating himself to death &mdash; in &ldquo;The Whale,&rdquo; and he took home the Best Actor prize.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraser was clearly already emotional when his name was announced, and everyone at his table got to their feet and cheered. The applause continued as he made his way to the stage, stopping only to offer hugs and handshakes to a few people along the way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Fraser took the stage, it was clear that he was not going to make it through the speech without his emotions getting the best of him.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Joe Boot explains how the opposite of law is not grace, nor love, but lawlessness, which often masquerades as love. Joe pulls illustrations from throughout Scripture to demonstrate the enduring validity of God&rsquo;s law in the era of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. If Christ took the law seriously, and if we are to be imitators of Him, then it behooves us to take the law seriously as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/new-guidelines-recommend-drugs-surgery-for-12-year-olds-to-tackle-obesity-early?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/new-guidelines-recommend-drugs-surgery-for-12-year-olds-to-tackle-obesity-early?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New guidelines from American Academy of Pediatrics suggest treating childhood obesity with drugs, surgery</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medications and surgery are being recommended for children as young as 12 in order to fight off obesity "early and aggressively," according to new guidelines released Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the practice of "watchful waiting" was applied to see if a child would grow out of their obesity but "Waiting doesn&rsquo;t work," according to Dr. Ihuoma Eneli, who co-authored the first guidance on childhood obesity in 15 years from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Associated Press reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What we see is a continuation of weight gain and the likelihood that they'll have (obesity) in adulthood," Eneli continued. Eneli is the director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children&rsquo;s Hospital located in Columbus, Ohio. According to the Columbus Dispatch, Columbus' Childrens Hospital has spent 3.3 billion in recent additions to its complex.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance contains specific diets, exercises and other behavior and lifestyle interventions, as well as specific ages at which specific treatments can and should be offered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medications for kids as young as 12 and surgery for kids as young as 13 are now the recommendations in order to stave off the worsening obesity problem that affects more than 14.4 million young people in the US and is responsible for myriad health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is for the new guidelines to change the way that obesity is viewed, so that its not just seen as "a personal problem, maybe a failure of the person's diligence," said Dr. Sandra Hassink, another co-author of the guidance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is not different than you have asthma and now we have an inhaler for you," she added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines also take into account that obesity is often affected by biological factors, and that it's not just a lifestyle problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obesity affects close to 20 percent of US children and teens, and around 42 percent of adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new guidelines come at the same time as a new obesity drug for children is approved for use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegovy, a weekly injection for use in children ages 12 and older, has been shown in trials to be efficient for teenages, reducing their BMI by around 16 percent on average. The drug affects the communication between the brain and the stomach, enabling the user to feel more full than they otherwise would be.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2023/01/15/how-badly-did-we-overcount-covid-deaths-and-hospitalizations-n523940"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2023/01/15/how-badly-did-we-overcount-covid-deaths-and-hospitalizations-n523940</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How badly did we overcount COVID deaths and hospitalizations?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;re still only on the first steps of the road to learning how badly the COVID pandemic was handled by the government, the media, and, well&hellip; pretty much everyone. But the veil is slowly being lifted regarding some of the unforced errors that were made. Even the legacy media is starting to admit that a serious math error took place alongside the many other errors being discovered. Specifically, the total count of COVID hospitalizations and deaths being reported was obviously far higher than it should have been. At Townhall, our colleague Sarah Arnold reports that a CNN medical specialist and Washington Post columnist has been allowed to speak the truth. Many of the people hospitalized &ldquo;for COVID&rdquo; sought medical care for entirely different reasons, and many of the dead did not actually die from COVID or anything related to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly two years after the Covid-19 pandemic, CNN medical analyst and Washington Post columnist Dr. Lena Wen admitted that hospitals were exaggerating the number of deaths they claimed was from Covid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titled, &ldquo;We Are Over-Counting COVID Deaths and Hospitalizations. That&rsquo;s a Problem,&rdquo; Wren acknowledged that &ldquo;90 percent of patients diagnosed with COVID are actually in the hospital for some other illness.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Since every hospitalized patient gets tested for covid, many are incidentally positive,&rdquo; Wren wrote, citing Robin Dretler, an attending physician at Emory Decatur Hospital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sarah points out, while this admission may be a welcome step toward setting the record straight, it&rsquo;s coming out two years too late. Those death and hospitalization figures were used to justify all manner of government overreach and oppression. Learning these facts now will not do anything to change the past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how could the math possibly have been so wrong? That&rsquo;s easy enough to explain. Every patient or body showing up at a hospital or a morgue was tested for COVID. If the test came back positive, that person was added to the count. So a nearly asymptomatic person who was hit by a car and died was added to the death toll. A patient admitted to the hospital with a knife wound to the stomach who tested positive was listed as another &ldquo;COVID hospitalization.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s not as if at least some of us didn&rsquo;t already know this. There were people, including leading doctors and virologists, who were talking about this all through 2021. Or at least they were trying to talk about it. You didn&rsquo;t hear a peep about this on MSNBC or CNN unless it was a segment calling out &ldquo;misinformation.&rdquo; Dr. Robert Malone, an actual mRNA vaccine research scientist, was banned from Twitter for trying to bring up this issue. (He was reinstated after Musk took over.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that we&rsquo;re talking about the period in 2021 when the virus was still running wild. Pandemic porn was at a premium on cable news outlets and in the larger newspapers. Andrew Cuomo was still giving his Emmy-winning (later rescinded) daily pandemic updates and being touted as the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;shadow president.&rdquo; CNN kept a running count of the deaths and hospitalizations in the upper right corner of the screen 24/7 no matter what story they were currently covering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are going to be a lot of people with much to answer for when all of this is said and done. Will any of them be held accountable? Don&rsquo;t hold your breath. (And if you do hold your breath for too long, you&rsquo;ll probably be taken to the emergency room and counted as another &ldquo;COVID hospitalization.&rdquo;)</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Country&rsquo;s Biggest School Districts Are Explicitly Hiding Kids&rsquo; Gender Transitions From Parents</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nation&rsquo;s largest school districts are implementing policies that require educators to keep students&rsquo; gender transitions a secret from their parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Unified School District, Chicago Public Schools and New York Public Schools are promoting practices and policies that hide a student&rsquo;s transgender status from their parents. The policies have become a cultural flashpoint amid a battle over the role parents should play in their child&rsquo;s education, and the extent to which gender ideology has infiltrated K-12 classrooms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest school district in the nation with 565,000 students, has a &ldquo;Gender Identity and Students &ndash; Ensuring Equity and Nondiscrimination&rdquo; policy that tells educators to be mindful that a student may have not told their parents about their change in gender identity and be careful not to reveal the child&rsquo;s gender status. Educators are advised to not reveal a student&rsquo;s gender identity unless the student wants because the parent may not be &ldquo;supportive of the student.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Public Schools, which enrolls about 340,000 students, has a &ldquo;guidelines regarding the support of transgender and gender nonconforming students&rdquo; which requires a &ldquo;student administrative support team&rdquo; to coordinate action and support for transgender and gender nonconforming students. Parents are not required to be notified or involved in the process of the child&rsquo;s transition at school, the guidelines stated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York City Department of Education which oversees New York Public Schools, with more than one million students, released guidelines and protocols for transgender students that advised educators that some students do not want their parents to know about their gender status. Students do not need parental consent or a court-ordered name and gender change before changing their name and pronouns at school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montgomery County Public School in Maryland, which enrolls about 160,000 students, has a &ldquo;Guidelines for Student Gender Identity&rdquo; that stated that students have the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to keep their gender transitions a secret from their parents. Educators must &ldquo;respect the right of students to keep their gender identity or transgender status private and confidential.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upper Moreland School District in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, added a &ldquo;Code of Conduct&rdquo; for the 2022-2023 school year which tells elementary school teachers that they should not share if a student has or is making a change in their gender identity with the student&rsquo;s parents unless instructed by the child. A presentation to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District Board of Education, which enrolls about 134,000 students, detailed district policy that stated that a student can request a name or pronoun change at school without parental consent.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Eric Adams slams Biden's border crisis from El Paso, says New York has 'no room' for more migrants</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After surveying the US-Mexico border this weekend, New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams called on the Biden administration to do more to address the massive influx of illegal immigrants that is causing a border crisis and overwhelming New York, and other major cities. He called the situation at the border a "national crisis," and said New York has "no room" for more migrants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams said Friday that New York City, which has proclaimed itself a "sanctuary city" is at its "breaking point" as record numbers of illegal migrants continue to arrive in the Big Apple. Over 3,100 migrants seeking asylum showed up last week, with more than 800 arriving on Thursday alone. Adams has said "there's no room at the inn."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Fox News, the mayor submitted an emergency mutual aid request to New York State this weekend for immediate assistance to shelter the illegal migrants. Thousands of illegal migrants have been bused to New York City by the city of El Paso, as well as by the state of Texas since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City has a right to shelter law in place, meaning that anyone who seeks shelter will be granted a place to sleep. This law was made with New York's average number of homeless in mind, and New York simply does not have enough shelter for the huge increases they are seeing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunday afternoon, Adams spoke at a press conference alongside El Paso Democratic Mayor Oscar Leeser, saying, "We&rsquo;re pointing the finger &hellip; at our national government. This is a national problem. We must have real immigration reform, and we must immediately have a short-term fix of making sure that the cost of this does not fall on our local cities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams added that the illegal migrants are given a false impression from websites before they travel that The Big Apple is "paved with gold" and that they will be &ldquo;given employment" when they arrive. "Our cities are being undermined. And we don&rsquo;t deserve this. Migrants don&rsquo;t deserve this. And people who live in the cities don&rsquo;t deserve this," Adams continued. "We expect more from our national leaders to address this issue in a real way."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Fran's reparations committee proposes $5 million to each Black longtime resident, total debt forgiveness</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco&rsquo;s reparations committee has proposed paying each Black longtime resident $5 million and granting total debt forgiveness due to the decades of "systematic repression" faced by the local Black community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco African American Reparations Advisory Committee, which advises the city on developing a plan for reparations for Black residents, released its draft report last month to address reparations &ndash; not for slavery, since California was not technically a slave state, but "to address the public policies explicitly created to subjugate Black people in San Francisco by upholding and expanding the intent and legacy of chattel slavery."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft plan includes a long list of financial recommendations for Black San Francisco residents, including a one-time, lump sum payment of $5 million to each eligible individual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for the program, the applicant must be 18 years old and have identified as Black or African American on public documents for at least 10 years. They must also prove at least two of eight additional criteria, choosing from a list that includes, "Born in San Francisco between 1940 and 1996 and has proof of residency in San Francisco for at least 13 years," and/or, "Personally, or the direct descendant of someone, incarcerated by the failed War on Drugs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan also calls on the city to supplement lower-income recipients&rsquo; income to reflect the Area Median Income (AMI), about $97,000, annually for at least 250 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan also seeks to establish "a comprehensive debt forgiveness program" that clears each eligible person&rsquo;s student and housing loans, credit card debt, etc.</span></p>

   <link>https://app.dropwave.io/episode/8fc4dde1-22f3-408a-809b-42b92d42b462/having-two-legs-how-to-be-happy.mp3</link>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Be Happy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Christians just can&rsquo;t seem to be happy. Sometimes there are real medical issues at work, chemical or hormonal imbalances in play, but sometimes it&rsquo;s mysterious. When there are no obvious medical issues, we should not relegate the spiritual to some other realm. The state of your heart before God is closely related to your happiness, your joy, your peace. How could it not be? The God of the Universe made you, and your greatest comfort and joy is in Him. As the Great Augustine said, &lsquo;Our hearts are restless until we find our rest in Him.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Makes People Sad?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;A glad heart makes a cheerful face, but by sorrow of heart the spirit is crushed&rdquo; (Prov. 15:13). And what makes a heart sorrow? Sin. Hard providences like the loss of dear friends or death also cause grief, but when your heart is clean before God, the Spirit comforts and refreshes and the sting slowly subsides. But I&rsquo;m talking about the gnawing, aching darkness of unexplainable depression. The Bible says that one of the first things we should consider is whether we have unconfessed sin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psalm 32:1 says, &ldquo;Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.&rdquo; But the word translated &ldquo;blessed,&rdquo; could just as easily be translated &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; Happy is everyone whose sin is forgiven and covered. Happy is the man against whom the Lord does not reckon his iniquity (Ps. 32:2). David knows this from experience, and he remembers the time before that: &ldquo;When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.&rdquo; When David refused to confess his sins, his bones ached, and every day was a dark downer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when Christians get into these depression funks, when they have a backlog of bitterness, resentment, or other unconfessed sins, and everything goes dark, they often begin to question whether they are really Christians, whether they are really saved. And that is certainly a question that should be asked on occasion (2 Cor. 13:5). But in general when people have been walking with God and then find themselves drifting into a sad, dark place, this is actually not a sign that they aren&rsquo;t saved; rather it is a sign that they </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saved. David knows this, and he says so in the next verse in Psalm 32: &ldquo;For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer&rdquo; (Ps. 32:4). Whose hand was heavy upon David? God&rsquo;s hand was heavy upon him. It was God who was making David feel so bad, so awful. And that means that God was with David. But God loves His blood-bought people so much that He refuses to let them be happy when they are clinging to their sin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Hebrews 12 it says, quoting Proverbs, &ldquo;For the Lord disciplines the one He loves, and chastises every son whom He receives&rdquo; (Heb. 12:6). When you are disciplined, God is treating you like sons (Heb. 12:7). In fact, it says that if you are not disciplined, if you are not chastised when you sin, then that&rsquo;s when you should wonder if you are really a son (Heb. 12:8). God&rsquo;s fatherly discipline is not pleasant but painful for the moment, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it (Heb. 12:11).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">God disciplines his children and gives them temporary pain and sadness so that they will confess their sins and come back out into the light, back into the joy and fellowship, so that they will be happy. You cannot keep your sin and be happy at the same time. And we are the kind of stubborn creatures who cling to sins for a while, preferring them and our sadness, to the freedom and happiness that God offers us in Jesus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the sadness is usually a proof that we really do belong to Him, and He is treating us as sons, not letting us get away with sin, not letting us be happy in our sin. A true sign of an old, dead heart, of reprobation, is someone who feels fine, who feels good even in his sin. I do not believe that they have true happiness or true joy, and even in those situations, there is still a prick of truth buried somewhere in their conscience. But there is such a thing as a hard heart and a seared conscience, and those are people that God has given over to their sin. They lie and do not remember. They steal and do not notice. They commit adultery and wipe their mouths and say, &lsquo;I have done nothing wrong&rsquo; (Prov. 30:20, cf. Rom. 1:24).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When David finally confessed his sins, God forgave him (Ps. 32:5), and that forgiveness was like a high rock above the surging waves of anxiety, fear, and sorrow (Ps. 32:6). The forgiveness of God is like a hiding place, a shelter, a warm home from the cold, a fortress of safety from every threat (Ps. 32:7). And David closes the Psalm summarizing the whole point: &ldquo;Many sorrows are to the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds those who trust the Lord&rdquo; (Ps. 32:10). And the implication is clear: those who are surrounded by the steadfast love of Lord are happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, are you struggling with recurring darkness, sorrow, lethargy, apathy? There may be other factors at work, but why not start with what the Bible says? Why not start with checking to see if you have a clean heart? Are you harboring anything? Are there any closets in your heart that you dare not open? And sins shoved into some corner, that you&rsquo;re hoping will just go away? Is God&rsquo;s hand heavy upon you because He wants you to be free? Is God disciplining you as a son because He loves you and does not want you to keep holding on to that old sin?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Final Thoughts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, sometimes Christians try to confess or start to confess their sin but they don&rsquo;t actually complete the task. So the pastor suggests confession as a solution to their sadness, and they say, &lsquo;I already tried that and it didn&rsquo;t work.&rsquo; But often the confession was thrown up to the ceiling in desperation, but it wasn&rsquo;t a thorough and obedient repentance. It&rsquo;s not enough to merely feel bad about sin. &ldquo;For godly sorrow produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly sorrow produces death&rdquo; (2 Cor. 7:10). So it&rsquo;s fully possible to feel bad about sin and really feel sorry, and for everything to only get worse. It&rsquo;s not enough to just feel bad; you have to confess your sin to the Lord and anyone you have sinned against and repent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repentance means turning, even turning around. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve been angry with your wife or your husband for a long time. Maybe it was one thing they did or said years ago, or maybe it was a pattern of sins over a long time. And sometimes you think about your bitterness and you feel bad about it, and maybe you even confess that one moment of bitterness. But Hebrews says that bitterness is a root that springs up and defiles many (Heb. 12:15). In other words, you might have confessed one branch of that ugly prickle plant, but have you uprooted the whole knotted, oozing, and spikey thing? And in its place, have you planted flowers?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repentance means confessing, asking for forgiveness, and having put off that old rotting man, putting on the new living man. Have you confessed the whole thing, have you dug down as deep as you can go, and pulled the whole thing up by the roots, hating it all, kill it all, and put grace in its place? Or have you been like Bilbo the Hobbit with the ring, saying that you will leave it behind, but still mindlessly putting it back in your pocket? If you&rsquo;ve been struggling with bitterness toward your spouse for sometime, chances are good that they&rsquo;ve felt it, even if it&rsquo;s been under the surface. You need to confess it to them, and then you need to thank them for being your wife/your husband, tell them you love them, and tell them that you will be endeavoring to love, honor, and cherish them from now on, just like you promised in your wedding vows. The old habit may still pop up occasionally after that, but if you&rsquo;ve pulled out the beast by the roots, you can pull out the occasional little weed, and you&rsquo;ll be right back in the joy. But if all you ever do is pluck off the end of one gnarly branch, the whole spikey weed is still sitting there in your heart; so of course you&rsquo;re still not happy. You didn&rsquo;t do the whole job.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, a word about introspection. There&rsquo;s a particular temptation for some to spend an inordinate amount of time examining the soil of their hearts in search of weeds, and they struggle with bouts of anxiety and depression because they worry that they haven&rsquo;t really dealt with all of their sin, or maybe they haven&rsquo;t dealt with it fully or completely. First, I recommend the 30 second rule which is sort of like when you drop food and pick it up quickly. Except, it&rsquo;s not really like that at all. The only thing it has in common with that rule is the 30 seconds part. But what I mean is that if you&rsquo;re one of those introspective types, and you&rsquo;ve confessed some sin around 15 times but it&rsquo;s still gnawing at you and there&rsquo;s a little black rain cloud pouring on your heart, you should ask the Lord to name what the sin is that you have not yet confessed. And give it 30 seconds and no more. The Holy Spirit really does convict believers of sin, but the Holy Spirit is the Comforter. The Holy Spirit convicts believers of sin so that they can confess quicly, repent, and get back into the joy. The Holy Spirit gives us the peace of Christ. In other words, if you&rsquo;re sitting under that little black rain cloud for hours or days, that isn&rsquo;t the Holy Spirit. That&rsquo;s the Devil. That&rsquo;s Satan, the Accuser. God does not put His children on a spit to roast them over the fire of the Spirit. That&rsquo;s just not His way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, one of you will say, but isn&rsquo;t His hand heavy upon His people sometimes because they won&rsquo;t confess their sins? Yes, but He does that for sins </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">they know about</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. God&rsquo;s hand is heavy upon those who are intentionally keeping silent, who refuse to confess sins they know they should confess. He doesn&rsquo;t do that for vague feelings of guilt. The Spirit convicts us of concrete sins so that we can confess them immediately, get forgiven, and have peace and joy again quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequently, introspection is a form of sadistic hubris and pride. Frequently, the introspectionist is obsessed with himself/herself, and you can tell because most of their sentences begin with: I, me, myself, I, I, I, my, my, me. But you aren&rsquo;t that important, and your self obsession with your feelings is often stealing from those whom God has called you to love and serve. There is also often a form of pride in refusing to believe and receive the forgiveness of God. Did you confess your sin? Then God has removed it as far as the East is from the West. Stop asking for forgiveness. He has buried at the bottom of the sea. He doesn&rsquo;t remember it anymore. Stop bringing it up. But when you climb on to the spit of your memory and insist on roasting for an afternoon or an evening or another week or month, you are arrogantly insisting to God that you know better than Him, that the blood of Jesus is not enough for you. Your sin is so bad and so important, that it requires some additional suffering that you are now providing for yourself. But that is of course ludicrous. You are not God; you are not Jesus. And you are terrible god, a terrible savior. And who do you think you are, telling God, &ldquo;no.&rdquo; He said that you are forgiven and clean. He told you to walk free with your head held high. He told you to shut up and smile because His grace is sufficient for you, because the blood of Jesus is enough. It is finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So do it. Smile. Preach the gospel to your heart, to your soul. Believe in the cross and resurrection. Confess your sins (the real ones), and maybe confess your introspection or prideful self-obsession, receive the forgiveness of God, and then walk in obedience. Don&rsquo;t look down, don&rsquo;t look back. Look to Christ, look ahead, look up, and remember that Christ is all. Christ is God. We are not that important; we are not the saviors of the world. And therefore, we are free to just be ordinary people, ordinary people who confess their sins regularly and therefore have clean hearts. And that is how to be happy.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Comedian Next Door!&nbsp; Jeff Hicks is a pastor and friend-of-a-friend.&nbsp; This is his first conversation with John outside of social media. Get to know the two of them as they get to know each other! We'll see whether there's any truth to the idea that having Christ is common makes two men brothers, even when they're strangers...</p>
<p>First, John shares bits of his testimony from early college days, listening to church leaders spar and debate. He quickly learned not every Christian was tough enough to sharpen iron.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, why do pastors seems to talk differently with their peers than they talk when they're with the rest of the Church?</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Christian nationalism arises out of justification for civil government and civil liberty grounded in bad theology.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden spars over classified documents in garage with Fox News' Peter Doocy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden sparred with Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy on Thursday, following revelations that a second batch of classified documents had been discovered at one of Biden's homes in Delaware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House Counsel's Office announced the discovery on Thursday, saying it had initiated a search of Biden's homes in Rehoboth Beach and Wilmington after news of the first stash broke this week and found documents in the Wilmington home's garage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Il8R4BEhrjo"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;Fox News presses Biden over classified docs in garage: 'What were you thinking?'&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Il8R4BEhrjo&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">Fox News presses Biden over classified docs in garage: 'What were you thinking?'</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Play Video</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House lawyers say they immediately contacted the DOJ when they discovered the documents this week. There has been no indication of what the documents contain or whether Biden or anyone else read them after he left office as vice president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wilmington documents are the second stash of Obama-era classified documents to be uncovered. The first collection was found at the Washington office of the Penn Biden Center, a Biden-aligned think tank.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/more-americans-id-as-republicans-than-democrats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/more-americans-id-as-republicans-than-democrats</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Americans identify as Republicans than Democrats</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in decades, more people identify as Republicans than Democrats, a striking change that bolsters polls showing that the United States is a moderate-conservative nation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest massive Gallup survey of 10,000 adults, 45% identified as Republicans and 44% as Democrats. That&rsquo;s a tiny edge for sure, but it&rsquo;s the first time the GOP has had the lead since former President George H.W. Bush launched the Gulf War in 1991.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup said: &ldquo;A virtual tie in party identification and leaning represents one of the better outcomes for the Republican Party over the past three decades.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when the choice of independents is thrown in, more U.S. adults picked that label. &ldquo;Since 2009, independent identification has grown and reached levels not seen before. Now, political independents (41%) greatly outnumber Republican (28%) and Democratic (28%) identifiers,&rdquo; said Gallup on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a related survey, the polling giant also said that America politically is a moderate-conservative nation. When asked to describe their political views, 47% of adults said moderate, 30% conservative, and 21% liberal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That survey also revealed that the Democrats are more liberal than ever. &ldquo;After hovering near 50% in recent years, the percentage of Democrats who identify as politically liberal rose four percentage points in 2022 to 54%, a new high for this group,&rdquo; said Gallup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.based-politics.com/2023/01/11/these-5-states-lost-the-most-population-in-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.based-politics.com/2023/01/11/these-5-states-lost-the-most-population-in-2022/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These 5 states lost the most population in 2022</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another year is in the books, which means there&rsquo;s another year of data to analyze, too. And the Tax Foundation just published an interesting analysis shedding light on which states gained the most population in 2022&mdash;and which ones saw residents leave in droves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis examined the time period between July 2021 and July 2022 and found overall US population growth was at 0.4%, but some states&rsquo; populations shrank while others grew. As it turns out, the state that gained the most population was Florida, which saw 1.9% population growth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states that gained 1% population include Idaho, South Carolina, Texas, South Dakota, Montana, Delaware, Arizona, North Carolina, Utah, Tennessee, Georgia, and Nevada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the 5 states that lost the most population were:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York (-0.9%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois (-0.8%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana (-0.8%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Virginia (-0.6%)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii (-0.5%)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noticing any trends yet?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, the states losing population are blue states with high taxes and heavily restricted economies. On the other hand, the booming states, like Florida, South Carolina, and Texas, are red states with lower tax burdens and less-regulated economies. That&rsquo;s just speculation, but it&rsquo;s borne out in the data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;People move for many reasons,&rdquo; the Tax Foundation explains. &ldquo;Sometimes taxes are expressly part of the calculation. Often, they play an indirect role (by contributing to a broadly favorable economic environment). And other times, of course, they don&rsquo;t factor in at all. The Census data and these industry studies cannot tell us exactly why each person moved, but there is no denying a very strong correlation between low-tax, low-cost states and population growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It really is becoming so glaring that even New York Governor Kathy Hochul recently admitted their state needs to address its population drain&mdash;months after telling Republicans to &ldquo;get out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As twitter user Jim Stinson tweeted: If you tell people to leave, they will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you over-regulate them and overtax them, they will leave faster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/out-of-left-field-uscs-school-of-social-work-bans-the-word-field-because-its-racist-apparently"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/out-of-left-field-uscs-school-of-social-work-bans-the-word-field-because-its-racist-apparently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USC&rsquo;s School Of Social Work Bans The Word &lsquo;Field&rsquo; Because It&rsquo;s Racist, Apparently</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever aspired to be the best in your field? Did you ever refer to doing a job outside of the office as &ldquo;field work?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if you answered yes to any of those questions, then you may unwittingly be promoting racism and bigotry &mdash; according to the University of Southern California School of Social Work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems wokeness knows no bounds &mdash; which is entirely the point of those who promote it. They have no limit in their zeal to assert power and are willing to coerce you into following along with their plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 9, the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work sent an email to faculty, staff, and students notifying them that the department has new speech code guidelines in order to ensure &ldquo;inclusive language and practice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Specifically, we have decided to remove the term &lsquo;field,&rsquo; from our curriculum and practice and replace it with &lsquo;practicum,'&rdquo; the letter explained.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is so egregious about the word &ldquo;field&rdquo;? Well, according to the brainiacs out on the West Coast, it is offensive to black and immigrants everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Language can be powerful, and phrases such as &lsquo;going into the field&rsquo; or &lsquo;fieldwork&rsquo; may have connotations for descendants of slavery and immigrant workers that are not benign,&rdquo; according to the letter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a word isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;benign&rdquo; that would mean it is malignant. Per the letter sent around, the word &ldquo;field&rdquo; is so malevolent that merely using it promotes &ldquo;white supremacy, anti-immigrant and anti-blackness ideologies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the school is beginning to put its words into action by banning the term altogether.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In doing so, of course, they are unwittingly revealing their own racism by implying that only black people and immigrants work in &ldquo;fields.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t need to be said, but of course, every civilization on earth has had &ldquo;fields&rdquo; in one form or another and somebody who worked there.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italian PM Giorgia Meloni Pulls a DeSantis, Sends Migrants to Left-Run Cities</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is facing a fierce backlash from their left-wing detractors after directing NGO ships carrying illegal migrants to ports in cities governed by pro-migration mayors, a move immediately compared to a policy ordered by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a recent security decree, authorities are now redirecting vessels that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to ports located farther away from the search and rescue area, frequently opting for cities governed by leftist mayors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the decree has been met with opposition from the left-leaning Democratic Party and the mayors of the affected cities, both of whom argue the measures are excessive and go against the supposed advantages of mass illegal migration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these concerns were rubbished by Wand Ferro, the undersecretary at Italy&rsquo;s Interior Ministry, who said: &ldquo;The left protests because NGO ships are finally disembarking in other regions of central Italy and no longer only in the South. Evidently, on the left, they would like to transform Calabria and Sicily into the refugee camp of Europe, a completely unacceptable prospect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferro stated that the asylum centers in southern Italy have faced persistent strain for years and that the government's action to alleviate that pressure amount to a necessary response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also dismissed the criticisms from NGOs who operate the migrant transport ships, pointing out that it is not unusual for these ships to keep refugees at sea for extended periods while waiting to pick up more migrants, adding that these ships have a tendency to take migrants to European ports instead of closer ports located in North Africa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Perhaps the left suffers from a sort of NIMBY [not in my backyard] syndrome, preaching welcome as long as it is away from their backyard,&rdquo; Ferro continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, NGOs who help facilitate these routes of illegal migration complained in a joint statement that the policy is hindering their efforts to save stranded migrants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Among other rules, the Italian government requires civilian rescue ships to head to Italy after each rescue immediately," the statement reads. "This delays further lifesaving operations, as ships usually carry out multiple rescues over the course of several days."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy of the Meloni conservative government, which came to power in last October's general election, immediately drew comparisons to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who last year sent illegal migrants to the wealthy, heavily liberal island enclave of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move sparked outrage from wealthy residents, with local authorities opting to activate the National Guard in order to have the individuals quickly removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Garrison Hardie with your CrossPolitic Daily Newsbrief for Thursday, January 12th, 2022. We&rsquo;ve got a lot of news to get to folks, so let&rsquo;s get right to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-vote-against-bill-requiring-medical-care-babies-born-alive-abortion-attempt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-vote-against-bill-requiring-medical-care-babies-born-alive-abortion-attempt</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">210 Democrats vote against bill requiring medical care for babies born alive after abortion attempt</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly every House Democrat on Wednesday voted against legislation that would require immediate medical attention for babies who are born alive after an attempt was made to abort them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which says any infant born alive after an attempted abortion is a "legal person for all purposes under the laws of the United States." Doctors would be required to care for those infants as a "reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill passed 220-210, and all 210 of the "no" votes came from Democrats. Only one Democrat voted for the bill &mdash; Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas &mdash; and one other Democrat, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, voted "present."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that level of care, doctors would be required admit those infants to a hospital for further care. Any violation of this standard would result in fines and imprisonment for up to five years, or both.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans argued on the floor that comments from Virginia&rsquo;s former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam are an example of why the law needs to be clarified to protect newborn infants who survive abortions. Northam was talking about third-trimester abortions and appeared to indicate support for delivering babies that might still be alive before taking their life outside the womb.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We all know in 2019, then-Gov. Northam of the state of Virginia stated this: 'The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that&rsquo;s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,'" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The cavalier attitude he displayed towards human life is just wrong," Jordan said. "It is simple. Infants born alive following an abortion are kids, are children. All newborns deserve the same level of care."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Democrats overwhelmingly rejected the bill. Some, like Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., argued that the bill would set up new requirements that would "directly interfere with the doctors&rsquo; medical judgment and dictate a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all circumstances."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and other Democrats said the requirement to eventually take infants who survive abortion to a hospital may not be in the best interest of the family.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats said the bill is unnecessary because it is already illegal to kill newborn infants, but Republicans accused Democrats of opposing the legislation to further their radical agenda of abortion on demand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAA grounds all outbound domestic flights as system crashes; Update: FAA lifts ground stop</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this writing, the FAA has grounded all outbound domestic flights until at least 9 am ET. It may take longer than that to restore service to its NOTAM system, the on-line platform that all commercial and military pilots must consult before taking off.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disruption began hours earlier, and the FAA has apparently struggled to overcome it. Savannah Guthrie calls it a &ldquo;sweeping outage,&rdquo; and it will almost certainly impact flights for hours even after the FAA restores it:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1613145694923096065"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1613145694923096065</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FAA lifted the national ground stop a few minutes ago, but it&rsquo;s not clear whether the NOTAM system has been fully restored or they&rsquo;re using work-arounds. They reopened two airports without out NOTAM due to &ldquo;air congestion&rdquo; prior to ending the ground stop:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well over 500 flights got cancelled this morning and over three thousand delayed. The snarl in air travel today will be massive. Stay tuned.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican President Praises Biden for Not Building Border Wall Even When &lsquo;Conservatives Don&rsquo;t Like It&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has praised President Joe Biden for taking a stand against the U.S. border wall, and criticized conservatives during the North American Leaders&rsquo; Summit on Tuesday. It comes as the United States sees a surge in illegal immigration across the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You, President Biden, you are the first president of the United States in a very long time that has not built not even one meter of wall. And that&mdash;we thank you for that, sir, although some might not like it&mdash;although the conservatives don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Lopez Obrador said in a joint press conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thanked Biden for maintaining a &ldquo;relationship of cooperation&rdquo; with Mexico and for not subjecting Mexicans who &ldquo;live and work in a very honest fashion&rdquo; in the United States to harassment. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not suffering raids as it unfortunately used to happen in the past,&rdquo; the Mexican president added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez Obrador asked Biden to insist that Congress &ldquo;regularize the migration situations&rdquo; of millions of Mexicans who have been living in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 21, 2021, a day after becoming president, Biden issued an executive order that halted construction of the border wall, commenting that a massive wall spanning the entire southern border is &ldquo;not a serious policy solution&rdquo; and a &ldquo;waste of money.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2017 and 2020, 450 miles of the wall were authorized and built under the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July last year, the Department of Homeland Security announced that the remaining funds, which were allocated for the construction of the wall along the Mexico&ndash;U.S. border, would be spent on &ldquo;environmental remediation and mitigation&rdquo; as well as for installing cameras, lighting, and detection technology in places where barriers are already built.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Biden administration, illegal immigrants entering via the southern border have surged. During fiscal year 2020, there were 458,088 apprehensions. This rose to 1.73 million in fiscal year 2021, a jump of 278 percent, data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During fiscal year 2022, apprehensions rose to 2.3 million. In the first two months of fiscal year 2023, apprehensions exceeded the total apprehensions of fiscal year 2020. According to Steven Kopits with Princeton Policy Advisors, the rise in border crossers is set to continue its upward trend this year as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kopits had earlier predicted around 2 million apprehensions for 2021 and 2.3 million for 2022, which is close to the actual numbers. For 2023, Kopits is predicting apprehensions to hit 2.6 million, another record in terms of annual illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Kopits&rsquo;s projections are true, it would mean that 6.9 million illegal aliens would have been apprehended between 2021 and 2023 under the Biden administration.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-life pregnancy center hires private investigators to look into attack, blasts FBI: 'Where's the manhunt?'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A network of pro-life pregnancy centers in New York hired private investigators to probe a firebomb attack against a facility last June after what they describe as an inadequate response from federal law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They've been responsive, but what they've done we don't know," Tom Brejcha, president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Society, told Fox News Digital of the FBI.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CompassCare, which has multiple pro-life pregnancy centers in upstate New York, announced last week that it was joining forces with the society, a nonprofit law firm, to hire private investigators to find those behind the incident at their Buffalo office last summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vandals reportedly smashed windows and lit fires in the building's reception room and nurses&rsquo; office, then defaced the building with "Jane was here" graffiti, an apparent reference to the radical pro-abortion group Jane's Revenge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pro-life pregnancy center was able to rebuild quickly, but the individuals responsible have not been apprehended.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brejcha, who told Fox News Digital that his own home was targeted last July by "40 to 50 masked, black-clad thugs," said the investigation has expanded to include all 78 of the attacks against pro-life facilities in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Along with CompassCare and others, we're looking to investigate connections here," the lawyer explained. "We have security video of attackers. We have license plates. We're pursuing the kind of investigation that lawyers pursue when they're looking to achieve justice on behalf of their clients, civil and criminal. So we're not sitting on our hands just writing letters to the editor about it."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brejcha said they hope to reveal "some of the folks that are behind this," and he is optimistic that they will succeed.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biological males blocked from competing in women's school sports in West Virginia: federal court</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge in West Virginia has upheld a state law preventing male athletes who identify as female from participating in female school sports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a ruling on January 5, Judge Joseph R. Goodwin of the Southern District of West Virginia said that HB 3293, the Save Women&rsquo;s Sports Bill, was "constitutionally permissible." The bill defines "girl" and "women" as biologically female for the purpose of secondary school sports and Goodwin found that this was "substantially related to its important interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law was first introduced in March 2021 but was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The ACLU represented trans-identified male middle school student Becky Pepper-Jackson who was barred from the girls' cross-country team. This, the ACLU argued, was a violation of Pepper-Jackson&rsquo;s rights under the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, the federal state statute that prohibits sex-based discrimination, reports Fox News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Goodwin ruled in favor of the ACLU and blocked the law at the preliminary stage, ruling that Pepper-Jackson was being excluded from school sports on the basis of sex making it a Title IX violation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Goodwin acknowledged in his new decision that the law was seeking to "prevent transgender girls from playing on girls&rsquo; sports teams," he highlighted the biological differences between males and females that give males a significant sporting advantage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While some females may be able to outperform some males, it is generally accepted that, on average, males outperform females athletically because of inherent physical differences between the sexes. This is not an overbroad generalization, but rather a general principle that realistically reflects the average physical differences between the sexes," said the judge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwin also noted that while Pepper-Jackson had taken puberty blockers, not all transgender athletes do. Some only socially transition, while others take blockers and hormones at a later stage in puberty. Goodwin stated that "there is much debate over whether and to what extent hormone therapies after puberty can reduce a transgender girl's athletic advantage over cisgender girls."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The fact is, however, that a transgender girl is biologically male and, barring medical intervention, would undergo male puberty like other biological males. And biological males generally outperform females athletically. The state is permitted to legislate sports rules on this basis because sex, and the physical characteristics that flow from it, are substantially related to athletic performance and fairness in sports," Goodwin ruled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West Virginia ACLU had filed the lawsuit alleging that banning girls from participating in school sports because they are transgender is unconstitutional.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2019 speech, developmental biologist Dr. Emma Hilton demonstrated just how wide the gap between the athletic performance of biological males and females is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"So big is the gap, there are 9000 males between 100m world record holders Usain Bolt and FloJo. So early does the gap emerge, the current female 100m Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson, is slower than the 14-year-old schoolboy record holder," said Hilton.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so long ago, the American dream was alive and well.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEYTON HILLIS IS REPORTEDLY STILL IN CRITICAL CONDITION</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors have given an update on the condition of former NFL running back Peyton Hillis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Hillis was rushed to the hospital after a swimming incident at a Florida beach. He reportedly rescued his two children who were in danger of drowning in the ocean. Both children were reportedly uninjured in the incident</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WREG Memphis reporter Otis Kirk reported that he had been told that Hillis is &ldquo;battling and definitely needs as many prayers as he can get.&rdquo; He also reported that the former Razorback&rsquo;s kidneys and lungs were the primary reasons why he was still in the hospital. WREG&rsquo;s report mentioned that Hillis&rsquo; kidneys are now the main concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirk did not reveal who gave him this information or their relationship with Hillis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He played both high school and college football in the state, before embarking on an NFL career that took him to Cleveland, Denver, New York, and Kansas City.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at Arkansas, Hillis was one part of a running back triumvirate comprised of himself, Darren McFadden, and Felix Jones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report on Hillis&rsquo; condition comes just as a prayer vigil was being held in his native Arkansas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillis volunteers as an assistant for his son&rsquo;s football team. Bryant Davis, who is coach and head of the program, was at the vigil and spoke to KSFM-TV. He talked about the importance of community support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;One of the great things about being a body of believers is relationship and community, and it&rsquo;s about being not only here to pray for people, but it&rsquo;s also here, Bryant said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also to be here to support them through times like this.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On today&rsquo;s show Tom introduces the topic of atheism and its various types. Drawing from John Gray&rsquo;s book: Seven Types of Atheism, the conversation unpacks and engages each type mentioned by Gray. Noting how not all atheisms are the same, the guys critically interact with each, showing the various kinds of challenges each bring to the cultural context. The result is a rich conversation around unbelief and it&rsquo;s weaker and more challenging forms which require a more substantive theological critique.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republican files articles of impeachment against DHS Sec. Mayorkas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon has filed impeachment articles against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, delivering on a promise he made last week before the 118th Congress was officially sworn in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The articles of impeachment against Mayorkas for "high crimes and misdemeanors," known as House Resolution 8, were introduced by Fallon in the House on Monday and have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Fallon vowed to file impeachment articles against Mayorkas after the Congress was sworn in. The effort from Republicans in the House is one of many that the new GOP majority will take as it works to fight the Biden administration on issues related to immigration and the southern border crisis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is currently no text available for the impeachment articles filed against Mayorkas, Fox News reported last week that Fallon's first article alleges that Mayorkas has failed to faithfully execute the "Secure the Fence Act of 2006." The article says that law requires the secretary of Homeland Security to "maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second article alleges that Mayorkas, "in violation of his constitutional oath, willfully provided perjurious, false, and misleading testimony to Congress." To back up that charge, the article quotes Mayorkas' testimony during April 26 and Nov. 15 congressional hearings in which he said the border was secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final of the three articles charges that Mayorkas "publicly and falsely slandered" border agents who were accused &ndash; but later cleared &ndash; of whipping Haitian migrants in Del Rio, Texas, in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayorkas on Sunday said he will not resign over his handling of the border crisis and insisted he will be ready for future investigations by House Republicans while continuing to fulfill his daily responsibilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/10/kevin-mccarthy-adam-schiff-eric-swalwell-ilhan-omar-committees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/10/kevin-mccarthy-adam-schiff-eric-swalwell-ilhan-omar-committees/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reps. Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell, Ilhan Omar To Officially Be Kicked Off Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committees</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy confirmed Monday night that Democratic California Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell will be removed from the House Intelligence Committee and the House will vote on the removal of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, McCarthy told the Daily Caller that if he is elected Speaker that he intends to strip Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee and Swalwell and Schiff from the Intelligence Committee. On Monday, McCarthy confirmed to The Associated Press (AP) that he would be moving forward with that decision, saying both Swalwell and Schiff should not have seats on the committee.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy has said Swalwell&rsquo;s reported relationship with a Chinese spy and Schiff&rsquo;s defense of the Steele dossier are some of the reasons they should be removed from the committee. McCarthy has said Omar&rsquo;s anti-Semitism is a reason she should be removed from Foreign Affairs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Swalwell can&rsquo;t get a security clearance in the private sector. I&rsquo;m not going to give him a government security clearance. Schiff has lied to the American public&hellip;,&rdquo; McCarthy told The AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Caller contacted Swalwell, Schiff, and Omar&rsquo;s offices about McCarthy&rsquo;s decision to move forward and have them removed from committee assignments to which they did not immediately respond.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Tate to remain in Romanian jail after losing appeal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former kickboxer and controversial social media personality Andrew Tate lost his appeal against not being held for 30 days at a Romanian detention center. Andrew, along with his brother Tristan, were detained last month pending a criminal investigation into alleged human trafficking and organizing a crime group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A document from the judge who instated the 30-day detention wrote that "the possibility of them evading investigations cannot be ignored" and the suspects could "leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition," reports Mirror.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In this sense, I would like to point out, at least from this point of view, I am also somehow amazed, there is not a single piece of evidence apart from the victim's statement that leads to the idea that a crime of rape was committed. In my view, there is no evidence to the formation of an opinion of reasonable suspicion regarding the commission of offenses provided for and punishable by criminal law. In this case we are talking about human trafficking and organized crime," said the Tate brothers' lawyer Eugen Vidineac.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/oregon-pledges-to-affirm-sex-changes-for-kids-as-reading-proficiency-plummets?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/oregon-pledges-to-affirm-sex-changes-for-kids-as-reading-proficiency-plummets?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon pledges to affirm sex changes for kids as reading proficiency plummets</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Oregon Department of Education released guidance for schools to better support "Gender Expansive Students" that include bathroom and pronoun policies aligned with radical gender ideology and include links for minors to seek "gender-affirming healthcare"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LibsofTikTok posted "Oregon Dept of Education released new guidelines on affirming LGBTQ+ students. They promote the use of pronouns, using bathrooms based on gender identity, and support 'gender affirming care' for minors. It also provides links to kids with info on 'tucking' &amp; 'chest binding'."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon Department of Education Director Colt Gill said, "It is our responsibility to move beyond mere tolerance and inclusion toward respectful, affirming, and celebratory school communities where all students belong and succeed."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new guidance comes as a growing number of Oregon students are falling behind in their reading proficiency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Oregon Live, "A staggering 61 percent of third graders and 54 percent of seventh graders aren&rsquo;t fully proficient at reading, including 30 percent of seventh-graders found to be substantially below grade level" in the Beaver State.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures of success according to the guidance include telling students, "You have the ability to change your first name in your school record and student information system, without legal documentation" and "You have the ability to change your sex/gender marker in your school record and student information system."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You have the ability to use school restrooms and changing rooms that align with your gender identity or safety needs," according to the guidance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance also includes informing students they can "date who you want, if you want" and can form student groups focused on LGBTQ2SIA+.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan offers textbooks and guidance to students so they can learn "inclusive and affirming information about the LGBTQ2SIA+" community and inform the students they can participate in "sports, PE, and school activities according to your gender identity."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"If you are 15 or older, you have the ability to seek gender-affirming healthcare from an Oregon medical provider," according to the list of resources, which also remind students they can seek mental health resources if they are 14 or over and get birth control if they are "any age."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance provides a detailed list instructing students where they can receive "gender affirming care" that includes details on "tucking" and "chest binding."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent guidance release is part of Oregon's larger LGBTQ2SIA+ Student Success Plan that was developed in 2020 "amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/irs-chopping-block-first-day-legislative-work-speaker-mccarthy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/irs-chopping-block-first-day-legislative-work-speaker-mccarthy</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS on the chopping block on first day of legislative work under Speaker McCarthy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House of Representatives is slated to vote on a bill Monday night that would cut more than $70 billion in Internal Revenue Service funding in an effort to prevent the agency from conducting new audits on Americans &mdash; fulfilling newly elected House Speaker Kevin McCarthy&rsquo;s promise ahead of taking the gavel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act from Reps. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., and Michelle Steel, R-Calif., would roll back the billions of dollars of funding for the IRS that was approved in the Inflation Reduction Act last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith&rsquo;s bill leaves in place funding for customer service and improvements to IT services at the IRS but rescinds several categories of unobligated funding, including money that could be used to conduct any new audits on Americans. In total, it would claw back $72 billion of the funding Congress approved for the IRS last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inflation Reduction Act granted an $80 billion boost to the IRS over a 10-year period, and more than half of those funds were aimed at helping the agency crack down on tax evasion. In 2021, the Treasury Department estimated that $80 billion would be used to hire 87,000 auditors and other new staff. Republicans have said they would fight this aggressive expansion that would more than double the agency&rsquo;s current size.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The last thing the American people need right now are more audits from an out-of-control, bloated IRS," Smith told Fox News Digital on Monday. "The Inflation Act funding for IRS would lead to the hiring of 87,000 new IRS employees tasked with raising enough revenue to pay for Democrats&rsquo; Green New Deal priorities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital just days before the midterm elections, McCarthy vowed that if he became speaker of the House, protecting Americans from the IRS would be his first order of business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whats-house-rules-package-tough-limits-federal-spending"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whats-house-rules-package-tough-limits-federal-spending</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What's in it: House GOP rules package aims to curb trillions in yearly heaps of new debt</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 55-page set of rules for the House that Speaker Kevin McCarthy hopes to pass on Monday will set ambitious new curbs on federal spending, part of the GOP's effort to stop piling on trillions of dollars in new debt each year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest changes is a return to a "Cut-As-You-Go" policy that says legislation cannot be considered if it increases mandatory spending over a 5- or 10-year period. This "CUTGO" policy requires bills that call for new spending to find offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the federal budget.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is a more aggressive stance compared to the "Pay-As-You-Go" policy under Democratic control. "PAYGO" also requires offsets to new spending, but those offsets can either be spending cuts or tax increases &ndash; and in either case, PAYGO rules were often waived entirely by Democrats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to go with CUTGO shows the new GOP&rsquo;s aversion to possible tax hikes, which can be seen elsewhere in the new rules package. For example, the rules require a supermajority in the House to approve new tax increases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"A bill or joint resolution, amendment, or conference report carrying a federal income tax rate increase may not be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a vote of not less than three-fifths of the Members voting, a quorum being present," the rules state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another push to stop piling on new debt, the rules will end the practice of allowing the House to automatically increase the debt ceiling through passage of a budget resolution that would require borrowing above the current ceiling. Instead, the GOP will require separate votes to raise the debt ceiling in a bid to restore accountability to Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current debt ceiling is $31.38 trillion, and the government is on the verge of hitting that cap.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules package also instructs House committees to prepare plans for strict oversight of the Biden administration, including an assessment of which programs continue to receive funding from Congress even though their authorization lapsed. It calls on committees to make recommendations on how to either consolidate or terminate those programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The package brings back the so-called Holman Rule, which allows members to chop specific agencies or even the salaries of specific federal employees when appropriations bills are being considered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-twitter-was-pressured-by-pfizer-to-suppress-posts-questioning-covid-vax-efficacy-twitter-files?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-twitter-was-pressured-by-pfizer-to-suppress-posts-questioning-covid-vax-efficacy-twitter-files?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter was pressured by Pfizer to suppress posts questioning Covid vax efficacy: Twitter Files</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Berenson dropped records from the Twitter Files on Monday, stating that a board member for Pfizer pressured Twitter to suppress and censor any posts questioning the efficacy of the company's mRNA vaccine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 27, 2021, Pfizer Board Member Dr. Scott Gottlieb emailed Todd O&rsquo;Boyle, a Senior Manager of Public Policy at Twitter&rsquo;s Washington, DC location, according to LinkedIn, and also Twitter&rsquo;s point of contact with the White House, Berenson reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email subject line contained a tweet from Dr. Brett Giroir, who had briefly served under Gottlieb in the Food and Drug Administration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That tweet read: "It&rsquo;s now clear that [Covid-19] natural immunity is superior to [vaccine] immunity, by ALOT. There&rsquo;s no scientific justification for [vax proof] if a person had prior infection."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Declares State of Emergency in California After Deadly Storms</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in California on Jan. 9 after a series of storms hit the Golden State, leaving about a dozen people dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several storms, as part of an &ldquo;atmospheric river,&rdquo; have hit California over the past two weeks and caused hundreds of thousands of customers to lose power, according to Poweroutage.us. As of the morning of Jan. 9, the website shows that more than 100,000 people are without power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Dec. 26, 2022, San Francisco has received more than 10 inches of rain, while Mammoth Mountain, a popular ski area in the Eastern Sierra, got nearly 10 feet of snow, the National Weather Service said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergency declaration allows the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and use emergency resources, the White House said in a Jan. 9 statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, who&rsquo;s currently in Mexico, declared that an &ldquo;emergency exists&rdquo; in California following &ldquo;successive and severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides.&rdquo; FEMA is authorized to provide &ldquo;equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency,&rdquo; according to the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, in anticipation of more storms, the National Weather Service warned of a &ldquo;relentless parade of atmospheric rivers&rdquo; that will likely hit California.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second storm system will hit on Jan. 10 with lower rainfall totals but will affect locations in Southern California, according to the federal agency. Heavy snow of as much as six feet will fall across higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains, located in the eastern portion of California, before tapering off on Jan. 11.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will likely be &ldquo;additional instances of flooding&rdquo; across California this week, according to the agency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian anti-Lula protestors storm presidential palace and National Congress</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The headquarters of Brazil's executive and legislative branches were stormed by demonstrators protesting against the election of socialist President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva on Sunday, breaking into the presidential palace as well as the National Congress building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pal&aacute;cio do Planalto, or Planalto Palace in English, is the workplace of Brazilian presidents, and is located in the same plaza as the National Congress of Brazil, as well as the Supreme Federal Court. The Pra&ccedil;a dos Tr&ecirc;s Poderes, or Three Towers Plaza, is in the capital city of Bras&iacute;lia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian outlet Metropoles reports that a hundreds of "Bolsonarists," or supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, "broke through blocks that prevent the entry of non-accredited people and entered the Planalto parking lot," before eventually making their way into the Planalto Palace and National Congress buildings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footage shared by American conservative activist ALX shows the moment protestors broke through the barrier as police attempted to subdue them. Eventually the police had to retreat while the crowd stormed through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video from inside the Planalto Palace shows the protestors, decked out in patriotic outfits, walking through the gas around the offices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 2:40 pm, the protestors also entered the National Congress building under a "shower of tear gas bombs."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More footage shows masses of protestors climbing up the ramps on the outside of the congressional building to get inside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Bolsonaro is suspected to have been in Orlando, Florida, since December, reported The Hill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diario 98 columnist George Marques reported that while the buildings were being invaded, a portion of the Bolsonaro supporters stayed behind to pray.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lula, who was inaugurated just one week ago, won 50.83 percent of the vote compared to conservative incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who won 49.17, in the country's October 2 vote. There was a runoff election afterwards on October 30 which Lula won, and that win was immediately ratified by the Superior Electoral Court.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;God&rsquo;s Real&rsquo;: Bills Quarterback Josh Allen Fights Back Tears While Recounting &lsquo;Spiritual&rsquo; Moment on Field as Damar Hamlin Recovers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been a harrowing, terrifying, and yet oddly optimistic time for the Buffalo Bills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, just shy of a week after Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed and went into cardiac arrest during a football showdown between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals, the Bills returned to the field and won against the New England Patriots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that was only a bonus to the amazing news Hamlin is recovering and was able to watch the game from his hospital bed, sharing in the joy the 35-23 victory brought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamlin&rsquo;s healing has been an answer to prayer for a nation on the edge of its seat, wondering if the 24-year-old player &mdash; whose initial medical state was dire &mdash; would pull through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That emotional toll was palpable, particularly after the Bills&rsquo; win Sunday. Quarterback Josh Allen delivered an emotional statement and gave God all the glory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It was just spiritual &hellip; I was going around my team and saying, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s real,'&rdquo; Allen said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t draw that one, write that one up any better.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He continued, as he got emotional, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been three years and three months since the last kickoff return.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allen was addressing the first play of the game, a 96-yard kickoff return &mdash; a resulting touchdown that left the Bills in celebration. The significance here, of course, is Hamlin&rsquo;s number, which is 3.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&rsquo;s the great Jim Nantz and Tony Romo on the call:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1612148627904032768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1612148627904032768</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the players coming out donning Hamlin&rsquo;s number, Allen clearly saw significance in the fact it had also been three years and three months since that last kickoff return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allen also said during the post-game news conference he can&rsquo;t remember another play that impacted him in such a profound way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You want the truth? It was spiritual. It really was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bone-chilling. It was special. I can&rsquo;t remember a play that touched me like that in my life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that today&hellip; is why I love sports.</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the table, Neighbor. When you're listening to this podcast, we call you "Pkarlgh." On this FIRST episode of 2023, The Comedian (John Branyan) interviews Jason Farley!&nbsp;You've heard him on Knox Unplugged and CrossPolitic.&nbsp;This is Part Two of their conversation about "deconstructionism."</p>
<p>"What are you even saying to me right now?!" That's what the guys feel like shouting when they're talking to Deconstructionists. Atheists and other Postmodern Deconstructionists only want to UN-define words--never define them.</p>
<p>Pull up a chair and join the conversation. You're visiting the Comedian Next Door.&nbsp;(If you missed part 1, what's wrong with you?! Go back to last week and listen!)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Gaetz vows to continue speaker stalemate until McCarthy concedes or limits power</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Rep. Kevin McCarthy&rsquo;s most stubborn opponents in his House speaker bid is vowing not to fold and to continue the current stalemate until the California Republican either agrees to the defectors&rsquo; demands or drops out altogether.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who has been one of McCarthy&rsquo;s most vocal opponents, pledged not to back down in the House speaker showdown, intensifying what has already been a dayslong fight as the chamber looks to elect its next leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think this ends one of two ways,&rdquo; Gaetz told Fox News after the House adjourned on Wednesday. &ldquo;Either Kevin bows out, realizing there is no path to become speaker of the House even with one or two or three or five of the 20 who have opposed him half a dozen times on the floor, or he essentially has to wake up, bring the House into session, and put on a straitjacket with a rules package that we&rsquo;ve presented to him that doesn&rsquo;t allow a lot of discretion for the speaker of the House.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After failing to make headway in three rounds of roll call votes on Wednesday, McCarthy proposed a new bout of concessions to some of his most stubborn opponents in a last-ditch effort to win their support before the chamber reconvenes. As part of his latest concessions, McCarthy agreed to a proposal to add more Freedom Caucus members to the House Rules Committee, as well as further lowering the number of members needed to call for a floor vote to oust a sitting speaker, according to CNN.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compromise builds on previous concessions in which McCarthy agreed to lower the number of votes needed to oust him from the position possibly should he be elected, marking a significant win for far-right conservatives such as Gaetz.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The reason we&rsquo;ve demanded that is we do not trust Kevin McCarthy, and it&rsquo;s not a small body of work,&rdquo; the Florida Republican said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if those demands are met, however, Gaetz has vowed not to back McCarthy&rsquo;s bid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty GOP lawmakers voted against McCarthy to back Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) in the latest round of voting, with one Republican voting present. Donalds initially voted for McCarthy in the first two roll call votes before backing Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) in the third round on Tuesday, conceding that &ldquo;at the end of the day, we&rsquo;ve got to get to 218."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black couple given plot of land in reparations sells it back to LA for $20 million</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heirs to Bruce's Beach, the prime beachfront property in California's Manhattan Beach, have sold the land back to the county for $20 million after receiving it just over a year ago in an act of restorative justice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The direct descendants of the black couple who were run off of their land and business got a form of "reparations," according to LA County.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1912, Charles and Willa Bruce, a black couple, bought the plot of land for $1,225 and opened up a black beach club, reported the Los Angeles Times. These clubs were common in southern California during that period, when segregation kept black people out of "whites-only" beaches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing mounting pressure from racist individuals and groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, city officials condemned the property to eminent domain in 1924, claiming that they needed it to build a park.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Los Angeles County website, no park was actually built until nearly 30 years later, and the real reason for seizing the land was racially motivated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It is well documented that the real reason behind the eminent domain process was racially motivated with the intention of bringing an end to the successful Black business and to thwart other African Americans from settling in or developing businesses in Manhattan Beach," the government site reads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county ended up forcing the black couple off of their land, paying them only $14,000 when the plot was actually valued at $70,000, according to Daily Mail. The Bruces left the beach and closed their business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to their family, they never financially recovered. In July 2022, LA County returned the land to direct descendants Marcus and Derrick Bruce as well as Derrick's sons, Anthony and Michael.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It destroyed their chance at the American Dream. I wish they could see what has happened today," Anthony said when the land was finally returned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, it was announced that the Bruces had opted to cash out on the land instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Janice Hahn, stated that the selling of the land will help rebuild "generational wealth" that the family lost out on after their great-grandparents' business was destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This fight has always been about what is best for the Bruce family, and they feel what is best for them is selling this property back to the county for nearly $20 million and finally rebuilding the generational wealth they were denied for nearly a century," she said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is what reparations look like and it is a model that I hope government across the country will follow," the county official added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Non-Binary&rsquo; Founder of Indigenous Artists&rsquo; Collective Accused of Faking Native American Heritage</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-owner of a &ldquo;queer Indigenous artists&rsquo; collective&rdquo; in Wisconsin reportedly faked her Native American background and &ldquo;used the front to make money,&rdquo; the New York Post reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kay LeClaire, a woman who identifies as &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; was accused in an online forum of being white after claiming for years that she was of Metis, Oneida, Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Cuban and German descent. LeClaire is a founding member of an art collective and is well-known in the Indigenous arts community in Madison, Wisconsin. LeClaire went by the Indigenous name &ldquo;Nibiiwakamigkwe,&rdquo; the Post noted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reportedly, LeClaire earned artist stipends, a paid residency at the University of Wisconsin, paid speaking gigs, and art exhibitions based on her Native American background. But, a &ldquo;hobbyist genealogist&rdquo; who did not reveal their identity posted evidence of LeClaire&rsquo;s real ancestry on an online forum. It showed that LeClaire is of German, Swedish, and French Canadian descent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; LeClaire reportedly told local outlet Madison365. &ldquo;A lot of information has come to my attention since late December. I am still processing it all and do not yet know how to respond adequately. What I can do now is offer change.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The art collective said in an Instagram post that it had parted ways with LeClaire on Dec. 31, 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anonymous user who published LeClaire&rsquo;s ancestry online went by the screen name &ldquo;AdvancedSmite.&rdquo; They spoke with Madison365 and revealed they are of Native American heritage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Townhall reported that several high-profile activists had been caught pretending to have Native American ancestry, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Canadian academic Carrie Bourassa, and actress Sacheen Littlefeather, whose sisters came forward late last year after her death to reveal that she was of Mexican descent.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny&rsquo; Reportedly Pacing Far Behind &lsquo;Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts&rsquo; And &lsquo;Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3&rsquo; In Audience Interest</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report from Puck&rsquo;s Matthew Belloni claims that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny significantly underperformed compared to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 after the three films released trailers during Brazil Comic Con back at the beginning of December.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to studio source Belloni reports that Transformers: Rise of the Beasts racked up over 506 million views in two weeks across YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 drew in 187 million views while Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny only brought in 79 million views.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a peek at the YouTube numbers, as of today, the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny trailer only has 10 million views on the Lucasfilm YouTube channel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transformers: Rise of the Beasts has 26.3 million views on the official Paramount Pictures YouTube channel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 isn&rsquo;t trailing Transformers: Rise of the Beasts as much as Belloni reported after two weeks, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is still significantly off the pace compared to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, both films have more than doubled up on trailer views compared to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is not only trailing these films when it comes to trailer views as noted by both Belloni&rsquo;s inside source as well as spot-checking YouTube, but Belloni also claims the film is already at a disadvantage because Stephen Spielberg is not directing the film and Harrison Ford is 80 years old and is supposedly the leading man in a film franchise known for its action adventure heroics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film&rsquo;s promotion has also been plagued by director James Mangold&rsquo;s antagonistic behavior to concerned fans about what he and Lucasfilm have planned for the film.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucasfilm has a track record of destroying their male-led franchises, one needs only look at the the desecration of Han Solo in The Force Awakens that turned his character into a deadbeat dad, who then gets murdered by his own son.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This anti-male theme would be doubled down on in Rian Johnson&rsquo;s The Last Jedi that shows Luke Skywalker as a man who has abandoned everything he believed in and even tosses his lightsaber away like a piece of garbage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This theme is not isolated to the sequel trilogies, The Mandalorian turns what was pitched as a ruthless bounty hunter living in the outer reaches of the galaxy into a glorified baby sitter for a child-like Yoda character that is apparently not a child at all. The Book of Boba Fett also turned the famed bounty hunter into an incompetent town manager.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this track record, fans have a healthy skepticism of what Lucasfilm and Mangold will do to the franchise and have especially had their hackles up following the casting of self-proclaimed feminist Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to one fan concern, Mangold decided to attack him and then proceeded to lie about his attacks on the fan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Kadish shared his concerns writing on Twitter, &ldquo;To anyone thinking Indiana Jones 5 might be good, just let me point out&hellip; 1. Steven Spielberg is not directing. 2. Kathleen Kennedy is producing. 3. Harrison Ford is 78 years old. 4. It&rsquo;s written by Jonathan Kasdan, who wrote SOLO.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mangold responded writing, &ldquo;Thanks, Matt! 1) Keep making the world a better place crapping on things in the 1st week of production from your basement. 2) Never seen a script by Jon. Nothing against him. Just reality. Butterworths &amp; I started from a blank page. 3) 1-3 r hugely talented &amp; all at my side.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny does not appear to be connecting to people via trailer views and on top of that it has an antagonistic director who not only confirmed fan fears about Lucasfilm&rsquo;s production are legitimate, but he&rsquo;s openly degrading them for expressing such concerns.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-its-his-intention-visit-u-s-mexico-border-amid-historic-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-its-his-intention-visit-u-s-mexico-border-amid-historic-crisis</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden says it's his 'intention' to visit US-Mexico border amid historic crisis</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden says it's his "intention" to visit the U.S-Mexico border amid a record high number of border crossings, according to a report.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden made the comments Wednesday at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, saying that it's his "intention" to visit the border during his trip to the North American Leaders' Summit on Jan. 9-10, which will include meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visit would mark Biden's first trip to the border during his presidency.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People familiar with discussions surrounding the potential visit told the Wall Street Journal that Biden will not be making a policy announcement if he visits the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential trip comes amid a record-breaking crisis at the southern border, with 617, 250 total migrant encounters occurring so far in FY 2023 as of Dec. 29, 2022, according to Customs and Border Protection sources, adding that there's an average of 6,858 encounters per day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In FY 2022, migrant encounters reached 2.3 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 6, Biden said that "there are more important things going on" when asked why he'd visit a border state but not the U.S. -Mexico border itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has pushed for Title 42 &mdash; the pandemic-era policy which allows immigration officers to quickly remove migrants from the country on the basis of public health &mdash; to be lifted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled in favor of immigration advocates and gave Title 42 an end date of Dec. 21, the Supreme Court temporarily halted the policy's termination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without providing evidence, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in November that Biden has been to the border.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;White House Defends COVID Travel Restrictions as Beijing Threatens &lsquo;Countermeasures&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House is defending its decision to issue travel restrictions related to COVID-19 following several threats from China&rsquo;s communist regime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration said there was no cause for retaliation from Beijing after its communist leadership criticized Washington&rsquo;s decision to require a negative COVID-19 test from those who travel from China to the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no cause for retaliation here just because countries around the world are taking prudent health measures to protect their citizens,&rdquo; White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a Jan. 3 press conference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which rules China as a single-party state, announced that it will reopen its borders on Jan. 8. The move comes just one month after the regime abruptly terminated its zero-COVID policy in response to mass unrest, causing cases of COVID-19 to surge throughout China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move prompted a global outcry, and nations around the world are hurrying to put in place testing requirements for all arrivals from China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Dec. 28, 2022, saying that passengers would need to present a negative COVID-19 test result or proof of recovery before boarding a U.S.-bound flight from China. The CDC said the move was meant to &ldquo;slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States during the surge in COVID-19 cases in the PRC [People&rsquo;s Republic of China] given the lack of adequate and transparent epidemiological and viral genomic sequence data being reported from the PRC.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States joins the UK, Australia, Canada, France, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Malaysia, Qatar, and other nations seeking to place stronger restrictions on arrivals from China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the CCP said that the testing requirements were &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and vowed that the regime would &ldquo;take countermeasures&rdquo; against nations that issue travel restrictions on flights originating in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House defended the decision to require testing from all China-originating travelers based on the international consensus that COVID-19 is currently ravaging China&rsquo;s populace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s funny though&hellip; anyone remember when Trump shut down travel to China?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CCP has attempted to cover up the scale of COVID-19 infections in China and the number of deaths it&rsquo;s causing among the Chinese population, which has no natural immunity following almost three years of constant lockdowns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaked images of papers from a CCP conference in December 2022 revealed that Party authorities believe that as many as 248 million Chinese became infected within the first 20 days of December. Publicly, the regime claims that only 10 people died from the disease throughout the month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s generally what happens when you don&rsquo;t allow for herd immunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://bigleaguepolitics.com/report-at-least-769-recently-vaxxed-athletes-collapsed-last-year-during-competition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://bigleaguepolitics.com/report-at-least-769-recently-vaxxed-athletes-collapsed-last-year-during-competition/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report: At Least 769 Recently Vaxxed Athletes Collapsed Last Year During Competition</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the underlying stories of 2022 is the enormous number of professional athletes &ndash; primarily men with an average age of 23 &ndash; collapsing during competition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many of these instances have been documented in singular reports. Mainstream media outlets appear reluctant to link this unprecedented surge in collapses to the Covid-19 jab. Or to even bother asking follow up questions as to why or how this is happening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially suspicious considering the majority of these collapsing instances involved recently vaccinated and or boosted athletes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One America News Network (OAN) did some digging and discovered more than 769 athletes have collapsed on the field during a game from March 2021 to March 2022.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As outlined by The Defender, this spike &ldquo;in cardiac arrest and other heart issues among elite athletes coincides with the rollout of COVID-19 jabs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pearson Sharp of OAN asks:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many 23-year-old athletes were collapsing and suffering heart attacks before this year? Do you know any 23-year-old people who had heart attacks before now? And these are just the ones we know about. How many have gone unreported?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 800 athletes &mdash; young, fit people in the prime of life &mdash; falling down on the field. In fact, 500% more soccer players in the EU are dropping dead from heart attacks than just one year ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharp discussed how this unprecedented surge is not a coincidence. Especially because &ldquo;the Pfizer vaccine is known to cause heart inflammation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also alluded to the fact this number may be grossly underreported.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for these unreliable figures stems from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) showing only between 1 and 10% of adverse reactions according to past investigations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Warner, for example, is an athlete who filed a VAERS report about his own health injuries following the COVID-19 jab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Dr. Joseph Mercola put it; the filing took Warner 45 minutes &ndash; &ldquo;a length of time that many doctors can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t devote when it comes to reporting adverse vaccine reactions seen among their patients.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, elite athletes collapsing in game increased so much in 2022 that even a mainstream media sports channel in Australia has speculated that the health issues could be linked to COVID-19 shots.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1513542808531046409"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1513542808531046409</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this number steadily grows, mainstream outlets appear to be ignoring these collapses and their potential linkage to the Covd-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the White House and other institutions continue pushing for more to take the experimental jab and get boosted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recession predicted in 2023 for US economy by economists at major banks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-thirds of top economists at the United States' largest financial institutions are predicting a recession in 2023, according to a survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary concerns cited in the survey of 23 primary dealers, including those from Barclays PLC, Bank of America Corp, TD Securities, and UBS Group AG, were a dwindling of pandemic savings, a decline in the housing market, and a tightening of lending rules as potential warning signs of an incoming recession.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prediction follows a year of soaring inflation, accompanied by rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve that have risen from nearly zero in March, to 4.5 percent by the year's end. The Federal Reserve reportedly plans to continue its increase to 5 percent, then 5.5 percent in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists predict that this will force unemployment rates above five percent, resulting in millions of Americans losing their jobs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank doesn't forecast a decline in interest rates until 2024 at the earliest, as it attempts a balancing act of attempting to lower inflation levels without triggering a recession.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation began to increase at the beginning of 2022, rising at its fastest pace in 40 years. It currently sits at three times the government's preferred rate of two percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans' savings during the pandemic from decreased spending and government stimulus measures have started to dwindle, as consumers increasingly dig in to weather rising prices of most products, from groceries to gas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Households have also increasingly had to take out lines of credit to afford their lives, as total household borrowing increased by $351 billion between the second and third quarter, to a total of $16.51 trillion, the fastest increase in 14 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high interest rates have hit the housing market particularly hard, as mortgage rates continue to soar and home sales plummeted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks have also significantly tightened their lending standards, more often than not an indicator of an incoming recession.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the 23 primary dealers surveyed, only five believed that there would not be a recession: Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, and Morgan Stanley.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Schwartz, Senior US Economist at Credit Suisse, one of the five banks that didn't predict a recession, wrote of the outlook for 2023, "Several historically reliable lead indicators are sending recession signals, but in our view these measures are unable to correctly gauge recession risk in the current environment."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy warns Russia planning &lsquo;prolonged&rsquo; attack with Iranian Shahed drones</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Kyiv has gained intelligence suggesting that Russia is planning a prolonged attack by using Iranian-supplied Shahed drones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an overnight address Monday, Zelenskyy warned that in the two days since the world welcomed in 2023, Ukraine has stopped more than 80 drone strikes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds," he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy said that Russia is looking to exhaust "our people, our air defense, our energy sector" by constantly pummeling the country with air strikes &ndash; a strategy Moscow has been employing for months but which it has escalated as winter sets in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive," he said addressing Ukrainian pilots and those in charge of air defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow and Tehran, Iran, have repeatedly denied any drone partnership or the use of Iranian supplied drones in Ukraine despite evidence supplied by Kyiv and backed by Western defense officials.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zelenskyy urged his forces on the front lines, particularly those fighting in areas like Bakhmut &ndash; which has seen intense ground warfare for months &ndash; to continue to hold the line amid harsh winter conditions, which has likely slowed fighting in other areas like Kherson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian forces have continued to push the lines eastward in areas like Donetsk, and fighting has begun to intensify in the Donbas region where Russian backed forces have fought since 2014.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine&rsquo;s Armed Forces championed this week that Ukrainian forces have liberated 40% of the territory Russia occupied following its invasion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said that in the regions where Russian forces remain Moscow has lost roughly 28% of the land.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for my favorite topic, sports!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a listen to ESPN football analyst Dan Orlovsky on the hospitalized Damar Hamlin:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Vs59RDITc"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;fple-t&quot;:&quot;ESPN's Dan Orlovsky Praying for Damar Hamlin on NFL Live&quot;,&quot;fple-u&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Vs59RDITc&quot;,&quot;fple-mt&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;first-party-link&quot;}">ESPN's Dan Orlovsky Praying for Damar Hamlin on NFL Live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Play video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That took place on ESPN ladies and gentleman. This is why I love sports&hellip; sports has gone woke in recent years, but it&rsquo;s situations like this, that bring people together&hellip; God is always at work, but it&rsquo;s amazing to see His handiwork in this situation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI Paid Twitter $3.4 Million to Ban Accounts for &lsquo;Misinformation&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Bureau of Investigation paid Twitter $3.4 million to ban or suspend accounts for &ldquo;foreign influence&rdquo; and &ldquo;misinformation&rdquo; on the social media platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI has been policing speech on the social media site for years, eventually paying Twitter the money as reimbursement for the work, The New York Post reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inner workings of Twitter and its cooperation with federal authorities have been coming out in tranches released by independent journalist Matt Taibbi &mdash; what have become known as the Twitter Files &mdash; since business magnate Elon Musk took over Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taibbi has been tweeting and The Post has been reporting screenshots of emails between the FBI and Twitter staff, with FBI flagging specific accounts for alleged &ldquo;civic misinformation policy violations,&rdquo; &ldquo;spam behaviors,&rdquo; &ldquo;platform manipulation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ban evasion,&rdquo; asking Twitter to suspend or ban users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The files show that Twitter held monthly meetings with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, The Post reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI and other federal agencies focused on social media after the 2016 election, Taibbi noted on Twitter, as the FBI&rsquo;s social media task force grew to 80 agents and Department of Homeland Security worked with outside security contractors and think tanks &ldquo;to pressure Twitter to moderate content.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapper Zuby identifies as female to smash weightlifting record</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has become an unlikely feminist icon: the weightlifting hip-hop artist and Oxford graduate who set out to demonstrate that athletes who are genetically male should not be competing alongside women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapper, whose stage name is Zuby, was filmed last week smashing the British women&rsquo;s deadlift record, in which the weights are raised from the ground to thigh level, while he said he was &ldquo;identifying as a woman&rdquo;. The video has had almost 1m views on Twitter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 32-year-old later beat the UK women&rsquo;s bench press record too, joking that his work was &ldquo;strong, stunning and brave&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes amid a debate about the participation of transgender athletes in sport.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics including the tennis champion Martina Navratilova, who is a long-term campaigner for LGBT&hellip;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho murders suspect Bryan Kohberger arrives in Pennsylvania court for extradition hearing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suspect in the quadruple murders at the University of Idaho arrived on Tuesday in court in Pennsylvania, where he is expected to waive extradition and be transported to Idaho for a criminal trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Kohberger, 28, arrived at the Pennsylvania court in handcuffs Tuesday morning and is scheduled to appear before a judge at 3:30 p.m., according to the Daily Mail. The hearing won't be livestreamed, but a group of journalists and photographers will be permitted inside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kohberger, who is accused of killing four university students in their off-campus home in November, is expected not to challenge his extradition to Idaho, with his state-appointed attorney calling Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing a &ldquo;formality proceeding.&rdquo; Kohberger is likely to plead not guilty in the case, and his attorney has said he &ldquo;believes he&rsquo;s going to be exonerated.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kohberger was arrested on Friday in connection to the quadruple slayings, with police saying they don&rsquo;t expect to make any other arrests in the case. Kohberger has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder, as well as felony burglary.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We believe we have our guy, the one that committed these murders,&rdquo; Moscow Police Chief James Fry told ABC News on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/guy-idaho-murders-police-chief-96025071"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/guy-idaho-murders-police-chief-96025071</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be extradited, law enforcement need only prove that Kohberger is the person on the Idaho arrest warrant and that he was in the area at the time of the murders, according to Monroe County Chief Public Defender Jason LaBar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kohberger is a doctoral student studying criminal justice at the Washington State University campus in Pullman, which is roughly 15 minutes away from the University of Idaho. The suspect had driven home to Pennsylvania with his father for the holidays, with the pair returning to the state around Dec. 17, according to LaBar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s still unclear Kohberger&rsquo;s connection to the victims in the quadruple slayings, and police have not identified a motive. The probable-cause affidavit that would provide these details is not set to be released until Kohberger arrives in Idaho.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington State University identifies Kohberger as a Ph.D. student in its department of criminal justice and criminology. He completed his first semester in its criminal justice program earlier this month, the university said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A white Hyundai Elantra spotted near the victims' house around the time of the crime is believed to be Kohberger's, Fry said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police had previously said they believe the occupant had "critical" information in the case. Police do not believe anyone else was in the car at the time, Fry said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement personnel seized the car from Kohberger's parents' Pennsylvania home and it is being processed, according to Fry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement sources told ABC News that police identified Kohberger as a suspect, at least in part, by using DNA technology, and police then tracked the grad student to Pennsylvania through his car.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow police's only other prior interaction with Kohberger was a traffic citation for not wearing a seatbelt, which was issued while he was in the white Elantra, Fry said. The chief said he cannot release whether the suspect has any prior criminal history elsewhere.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damar Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest during game, heartbeat restored on field, Bills say</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest following a hit in Monday night&rsquo;s game against the Cincinnati Bengals causing him to collapse on the field, the team said Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bills said Hamlin&rsquo;s "heartbeat was restored on the field and he was transferred to the UC Medical Center for further testing and treatment."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"He is currently sedated and listed in critical condition," the team said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scary incident occurred with 5:58 remaining in the first quarter and Cincinnati leading the game, 7-3. The Bengals were on their second drive of the game when quarterback Joe Burrow threw a pass to Tee Higgins. Bills safety Hamlin came over to make a tackle to end the play.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamlin was on the ground for a while as he received CPR from the medical staff on the ground before he was put into the ambulance. Hamlin was being rushed to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Buck &amp; Troy Aikman described the incident on ESPN:&nbsp;</span></p>

On this FIRST episode of 2023, The Comedian (John Branyan) interviews Jason Farley!&nbsp; You've heard him on Knox Unplugged and CrossPolitic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Deconstruction. What is it? Why is everyone doing it?&nbsp; Even the people who are practicing "deconstruction" don't seem to know how to define it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jason helps John understand why nothing is really understandable... or something?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pull up a chair and join the conversation. You're visiting the Comedian Next Door.&nbsp;</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>A high level of expectancy fills the early pages and events of the New Testament Gospels. Herod, the Magi, Anna, Simeon, and "all of Jerusalem"&mdash;to name but a few&mdash;were all eager and expecting God to act. Thanks in part to the prophecies in Daniel and other prophets, Jerusalem was on edge before and after Jesus' birth. As we say goodbye to 2022 and welcome 2023, Christians need to be reminded that God is always "doing something," and to keep our own high level of expectancy and hope.</p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today Chris responds to the truism attributed to Francis Bacon, "Knowledge is power." The question he raises is, "If that is all there is to it, what does that imply--that forms of knowledge that don't lead to power are worthless, do they fail the test of knowledge then?" Chris warns, this is the road to totalitarianism. It isn't a fast road, necessarily--but it certainly gets you there eventually. Tune in to see what the Pugsters have to say about why the old truism isn't entirely true.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>We bring our series in Thomas Aquinas to a close by restating six significant differences between Thomistic thought and the reformation worldview that we believe is more consistent with Scripture. On the question of origins, nature and grace, ontology and anthropology, apologetics and Christian philosophy, the medieval thought of Aquinas falls short of the biblical position.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-asks-supreme-court-end-title-42-short-delay-lifting-restrictions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-asks-supreme-court-end-title-42-short-delay-lifting-restrictions</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden admin asks Supreme Court to end Title 42, but with short delay on lifting restrictions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration on Tuesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to let the pandemic-era policy Title 42 come to end, but requested a brief delay until at least after Christmas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a filing on Tuesday, the administration acknowledged to the Supreme Court that the end of Title 42 will likely lead to "disruption and a temporary increase in unlawful border crossings" but asked the court to reject efforts by a group of conservative-leaning states to keep Title 42 in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migrants have been denied requests to seek asylum under U.S. and international law 2.5 million times since March 2020 on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19 under a public-health rule called Title 42.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-gov-abbott-polar-vortex-threatens-migrants-bidens-border-disaster"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-gov-abbott-polar-vortex-threatens-migrants-bidens-border-disaster</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Gov. Abbott warns polar vortex threatens migrants due to Biden&rsquo;s border &lsquo;disaster&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told President Joe Biden on Tuesday that his "disaster" immigration policy is putting lives at risk as a polar vortex expected this week will create bitter conditions for the thousands of illegal immigrants who continue to trek into the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"With cold temperatures gripping Texas, your inaction to secure the southern border is putting the lives of migrants at risk, particularly in the City of El Paso," the Republican governor told Biden in a letter. "Your policies will leave many people in the bitter, dangerous cold as a polar vortex moves into Texas."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This terrible crisis for border communities in Texas is a catastrophe of your own making," Abbott wrote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor said Biden has failed in his constitutional duty to protect the border, which disproportionately impacts Texas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott warned that the situation would only get worse if the Title 42 policy ends this week. That pandemic-era policy allows border agents to turn migrants away at the border, and ending it could lead to a surge of migrants at the southern border just as Texas faces some of its coldest temperatures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Title 42 policy was set to expire Wednesday, but an appeal is being heard by the Supreme Court, which could decide as early as Tuesday evening. The Department of Homeland Security projects between 9,000 and 15,000 migrant encounters a day once the policy ends, which would add to the already highest annual total of encounters in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted an end to Title 42 would not mean the border is open. To suggest so, she said, is misinformation and "doing the work of these smugglers." Vice President Kamala Harris, who was tasked with identifying the root cause of mass migration to the southern border, has insisted in recent months that the border is secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott said he would continue to work with state-based officials to stem the tide of illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-confirms-zelenskyys-travel-us-ahead-massive-bill-funding-ukrainian-military"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-confirms-zelenskyys-travel-us-ahead-massive-bill-funding-ukrainian-military</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House confirms Zelenskyy's travel to US ahead of massive bill funding Ukrainian military</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration confirmed early Wednesday morning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on his way to the U.S. to discuss more assistance for the country during its ongoing conflict with Russia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to meeting with President Biden, Zelenskyy is slated to address Congress Wednesday afternoon as lawmakers plan to shell out more money for Ukraine in its latest $1.7 trillion spending bill. The budget includes more than $45 billion in new military and humanitarian aid for his country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A press statement from the Biden admin Wednesday morning said Zelenskyy's address to a joint meeting of Congress will demonstrate the "strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its official statement, the White House added President Biden has been rallying the world to support Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Three hundred days ago, Russia launched a brutal assault against Ukraine. In response, President Biden rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity," the statement read. "During the visit, President Biden will announce a significant new package of security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensive security measures were already underway in the nation's capital early Wednesday morning as the District prepared for the high-profile visit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 4:30 a.m., Capitol Police cruisers could be seen lined up outside the Capitol building along with cement barricades blocking roads leading up to the building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On behalf of bipartisan Congressional leaders, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent a letter to Zelenskyy encouraging his visit to Washington, D.C., in a letter explaining the leaders' "immense respect and admiration" for the Ukrainian president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending aid would be the U.S.' largest amount of financial assistance to Ukraine since the war started and is intended to support the fight against Russia for months to come, according to the Associated Press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress is also expected to announce a major package of $1.8 billion in military aid on Wednesday, which will include a Patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for Ukraine's fighter jets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. officials said the package will include about $1 billion in weapons from Pentagon stocks and $800 million in funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, according to the AP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the massive spending bill is expected to receive support from many Republicans in the House and Senate, not all are on board with the additional funding. Some GOP lawmakers argued the new round of aid, which will bring the U.S. commitment to the war to over $110 billion, is improper without greater accountability.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Senate Advances $1.66 Trillion Government-Funding Bill</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $1.66 trillion government spending bill drew overwhelming bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday as lawmakers steered it toward passage before a weekend deadline to avoid a partial shutdown of federal agencies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic and Republican negotiators agreed early Tuesday morning on the sweeping bill to fund the federal government through the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, raising funding from about $1.5 trillion in the last fiscal year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate voted 70-25 to proceed to debate of the bill, with some Republican senators hoping to offer amendments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of conservative Senate Republicans on Tuesday said they objected to the bill, but would not try to stop its passage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill includes other measures agreed on by negotiators from both parties, including a ban on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices and clarification of Congress&rsquo;s role in certifying elections, an attempt to avoid a repeat of the U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate and House leaders aim to pass the 4,155-page bill and send it to Democratic President Joe Biden for signing by the end of the week to ensure there are no interruptions to the government&rsquo;s activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tuesday vote was the first in a series of steps clearing the way for passage by Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to pass legislation in time could bring a partial government shutdown beginning Saturday, just before Christmas, and possibly lead into a months-long standoff after Republicans take control of the House on Jan. 3, breaking the grip of Biden&rsquo;s Democrats on both chambers of Congress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget experts found fault with the bill&rsquo;s size.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in the bill is $44.9 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies and $40.6 billion to assist communities across the United States recovering from natural disasters and other matters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ukraine funds would be used for military training, equipment, logistics and intelligence support, as well as for replenishing U.S. equipment sent to Kyiv. It also includes funding to prepare for and respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not ruled out the use of nuclear weapons in the conflict with Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in the Ukraine package is $13.4 billion in economic aid and $2.4 billion to help resettle Ukrainians in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The military aid would be on top of the record $858 billion in U.S. defense spending for the year, which is up from last year&rsquo;s $740 billion and also exceeds Biden&rsquo;s request.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. lawmakers also included a proposal to bar federal employees from using the Chinese short-video app TikTok on government-owned devices. And they backed a proposal to lift a looming deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of Boeing Co&rsquo;s 737 MAX aircraft.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Intruder&rsquo; able to walk into Uvalde school unchallenged as new report slams medical response</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Texas safety inspector posing as an intruder was recently able to stroll unchallenged into a Uvalde school &mdash; as a damning new investigation also blamed a &ldquo;flawed medical response&rdquo; for failing to save some of the 21 slaughtered in a mass shooting at Robb Elementary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspector was even able to enter through a back door that did not latch, eerily similar to how 18-year-old madman Salvador Ramos got into Robb Elementary before killing 19 fourth-graders and two teachers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shocking breach was revealed at a Uvalde school board meeting Monday night, attended by at least a dozen family members of victims of the May shooting, the San Antonio Express-News said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grieving loved ones were furious that &ldquo;somebody just walked right in&rdquo; seven months after one of the deadliest school shootings in history, KSAT also said of the meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a state-mandated security audit, an inspector posing as an intruder attempted to gain access to three different schools in the grief-stricken area &mdash; strolling into one unchallenged, the meeting heard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interim district Superintendent Gary Patterson admitted the error, saying the ongoing security lapse &ldquo;is really 100 percent my responsibility,&rdquo; telling the meeting: &ldquo;We have got to secure those areas.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlinda Arreola, the grandmother of Uvalde victim Amerie Jo Garza, shared a picture of a school safety officer sitting and looking at his phone.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kari Lake Trial Reveals 42.5% of Randomly Examined Ballots Were Improper</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Republican governor candidate Kari Lake&rsquo;s legal team, 42.5% of examined ballots in Maricopa County for the 2022 governor&rsquo;s race were illegitimate. Lake&rsquo;s trial began on Wednesday were she is attempting to prove that wide scale fraud took place in Maricopa County on election day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lake War Room tweeted on Wednesday that 48 of the 113 ballots that were reviewed during examination were &ldquo;19-inch ballots produced on 20-inch paper,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate tweet, the Lake War Room wrote, &ldquo;This Is how they disenfranchised Maricopa County voters on Election Day. The ballots were designed to be unable to be read through the machines. This wasn&rsquo;t an error. It was malice. The process worked exactly as they intended it to.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One commenter on Twitter noted that there was no way the improper ballot size could have been because of &ldquo;error.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The expert testified there are only 2 ways for the 19 inch image to have bee projected onto the 20 in ballot which would cause tabulator errors. Both methods require an administrator to change. This could not have happened by chance or error. It was fraud.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race between Hobbs and Lake was decided by less than 18,000 votes. The counts put forward by Lake&rsquo;s team contest her loss. Most counts were thrown out by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson, with 8 being tossed while two counts were allowed to proceed. Those counts deal with alleged intentional misconduct.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake told Turning Point USA&rsquo;s AmericaFest on Tuesday that this marked a &ldquo;huge win&rdquo; for her legal team, saying, &ldquo;we got great news. We&rsquo;re taking these b*stards to trial!&rdquo; Adding that Hobbs would take the stand in the trial.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was later announced by Lake&rsquo;s attorneys that they had withdrawn the subpoena for Hobbs to testify.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Maricopa County wants you to believe that they are so incompetent that all of the problems on Election Day can be written off as mistakes.</span></p>

It is a premier institution that forges evangelical leaders who don&rsquo;t fear or hate the world.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb bans the listing of former slave plantations and slave houses</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb has outlawed the listing of rental properties on its site where slaves have lived or worked, according to an update to their anti-discrimination policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moves come after a TikTok video from July calling out the company for listing an "1830s slave cabin" went viral.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The online short-term rental marketplace immediately removed the listing, then sought out others like it, enlisting the help of historical experts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb's "Work to fight Discrimination and Build Inclusion" now includes a section called "Prohibiting the Glorification and Marketing of Slavery," which states that in July 2022, the company "took a series of steps to address the listing of properties in the US that were known to include former slave houses," as they "have no place on Airbnb."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three main policies, which only apply to the United States, prohibit "prohibiting the listing of any home or other structure on a former plantation where enslaved people lived or worked if structures that existed during the time of slavery are still present on the property," bar "any structure specifically designed only to house enslaved people and that did house enslaved people," and prohibit "the promotion of slavery-related features as a selling point of a stay."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exceptions will be made for certain Experiences that "provide important educational context" led by "reputable partners and experts."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Currently we have removed listings and experiences associated with roughly 30 properties that are violating our policies," an Airbnb spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris blames Republicans for border crisis: 'Unwillingness to engage in any meaningful reform'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice President Kamala Harris blamed Republicans for the border crisis during an interview with NPR on Monday and said they were unwilling to engage on the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"And sadly, what we have seen in particular, I am sad to say, from Republicans in Congress is an unwillingness to engage in any meaningful reform that could actually fix a lot of what we are witnessing," Harris told NPR.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, who was tapped by President Biden to address the root causes of the border crisis and effectively became the "border czar" in 2021, told NPR that the White House plans to increase technology and provide more agents to help at the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris told NBC's "Meet the Press" in September that the border is secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular, over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed," she told NBC's Chuck Todd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court temporarily blocked an order that would lift Title 42's restrictions that allowed border officials to deter migrants throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The order was set to expire on Wednesday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nineteen states asked the court to keep Title 42 in place as immigration is expected to surge when the measure expires.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said she was unable to lay out what Harris' work on the border crisis looks like during a press briefing on Monday.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">20,000 Migrants Were Waiting Near El Paso for Title 42&rsquo;s Expiration</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, 20,000 migrants were reportedly waiting for Title 42 to end so they could cross the border into the United States, El&nbsp; Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser said this week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title 42 was scheduled to expire on Wednesday, Dec. 21. The order had been in place since 2020 that allowed Border Patrol to expel migrants at the southern border due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Post, Leeser said on Monday that the shelters on the other side of the border were &ldquo;completely full&rdquo; as migrants awaited for Title 42&rsquo;s removal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reportedly, Border Patrol has used Title 42 to turn away thousands of migrants trying to enter through the U.S.-Mexico border since its implementation under President Trump in 2020</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford proposes adding 'American' to 'harmful language' list</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Stanford University developed the "Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative" to replace certain words and phrases on its website with approved alternatives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of soon-to-be banned terms includes the label "American," which Stanford argues is too US-centric and ignorant of the other forty-one countries that also exist in the region. The university suggests "US citizen" as an alternative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford grouped their list of words and phrases into eight categories, "Ableist, Ageism, Culturally Appropriative, Gender-based, Imprecise Language, Institutionalized Racism, Person-First, and Violent."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list, which was recently password protected following backlash, was widely shared and criticized on social media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author and ardent feminist Christina Hoff Sommers blasted the university over the terms included in the "Gender-Based" category.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Don't use 'preferred pronouns'," she tweeted, citing the list, "because 'that suggests non-binary gender identity is a choice'."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also included on that portion of the list is the phrase "balls to the wall," which Stanford argues "attributes personality traits to anatomy."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one user pointed out, however, the "balls" in this case are not testicles, making the university's suggestion laughable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phrase is widely acknowledged to have originated among fighter pilots, who when making their planes go faster would have to push the throttle levers, which were topped with balls, to the wall of the dashboard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms under other categories include "handicap parking," "addict," and "Karen," which Stanford suggests should be replaced with "accessible parking," "person with a substance abuse disorder," and "demanding or entitled White woman," res</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&rsquo;s the iron law of academic writing," the Wall Street Journal quipped. "Why use one word when four will do?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Stanford, the list was compiled over an 18-month period in "collaboration with stakeholder groups," and is encouraged to be utilized by all students and staff.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Approves $10 Million Settlement for Health Care Workers Fired Over COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A U.S. judge approved a multimillion-dollar settlement on Dec. 19 for workers who were fired by an Illinois health care system for refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 500 workers who were terminated or, after seeing their exemption requests denied, got a COVID-19 vaccine, will receive compensation as part of the $10.3 million settlement, a preliminary version of which was first announced in July.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge John Kness, a Trump appointee overseeing the lawsuit brought by the workers, issued verbal approval for the settlement during a hearing, lawyers for Liberty Counsel and NorthShore University Healthsystem said. Kness plans to release a written judgment in the next week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a brief statement emailed to The Epoch Times after Kness&rsquo;s approval, NorthShore wrote, &ldquo;We are pleased with the Court&rsquo;s approval of a supportive resolution to this matter and continue to prioritize the health and safety of our patients and team members.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Mihet, vice president of legal affairs for Liberty Counsel, said in a statement that the group was &ldquo;pleased to finally get the court&rsquo;s final approval of this classwide settlement for these health care workers who were unlawfully discriminated against and denied religious exemptions from the COVID shot mandate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This case should set a precedent for other employers who have violated the law by denying religious exemptions for their employees,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty Counsel, a legal group that brings cases of alleged religious discrimination, was representing the 13 named plaintiffs in the case. The group successfully won class certification for all workers who were denied religious exemptions, a group that was initially believed to be 499 former and current workers but swelled after the preliminary settlement agreement to at least 519.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Dec. 12, 493 class members had submitted claims for a piece of the settlement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each worker who was fired stands to receive $24,225. Each worker who remained at the company stands to receive $3,725.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The named plaintiffs are in line to receive an extra $20,000. Those payments, described as service awards, will provide compensation for the plaintiffs helping advise on court filings, gathering documents, and serving as lead plaintiffs &ldquo;in a sensitive case involving personal health choices and religious beliefs over a matter of intense public debate, even when it was uncertain whether they would have to disclose their identities to the public,&rdquo; according to a recent filing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three workers objected to the settlement, but both parties urged the judge to disregard the objections, which were largely based on pay the trio felt they were owed after being fired.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marzena Novak, one of the objectors, said her actual losses from being fired and losing pay approached $140,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many health care systems, NorthShore imposed a vaccine mandate on employees in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NorthShore told workers that they could file a request for a religious exemption using a form that said the worker in question needed to provide &ldquo;a description of my sincerely held religious principle or practice that guides my objection to receiving the required vaccination.&rdquo; Northshore explicitly instructed applicants to not fill out lengthy answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NorthShore initially approved some of the exemption requests but then reversed the decisions and denied &ldquo;all or virtually all of them,&rdquo; according to filings from the plaintiffs. Officials said the employees failed to meet the standard for religious exemptions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees who wanted a second look were told to file an appeal that included their vaccination history since they were 18. NorthShore then said that any religious objections based on &ldquo;aborted fetal cell lines, stem cells, tissue, or derivative materials&rdquo; would result in denials because those products were &ldquo;not in NorthShore administered vaccines.&rdquo; All of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States have links to aborted fetal cell lines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs said the treatment violated the Civil Rights Act, which requires employers to treat workers similarly, and the Illinois Health Care Right of Conscience Act, which forbids discrimination on the basis of &ldquo;right of conscience.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NorthShore repeatedly denied that it violated the law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system also stated that it was &ldquo;an undue hardship&rdquo; to let unvaccinated staff work at NorthShore and that &ldquo;it initially denied many exemption requests and that on appeal it reconsidered some decisions and chose not to challenge that the requests were made based on sincerely held religious beliefs.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Christianity is no longer relevant to civil law and government. Many Christians want it to be or become relevant again. Today David uses Abraham Kuyper to explain why Christianity has made itself irrelevant. Without that understanding, we will have no clue why it will remain irrelevant despite all our Christian political action.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-sues-arizona-gov-doug-ducey-over-shipping-container-border-wall"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-sues-arizona-gov-doug-ducey-over-shipping-container-border-wall</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden Admin Sues Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey Over Shipping Container Border Wall</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department (DOJ) is suing Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and his administration over the use of shipping containers to build a wall along the state&rsquo;s southern border with Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on Wednesday, claiming that the project trespasses on federal property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Arizona has unlawfully and without authority failed to remove the shipping containers from lands owned by the United States or over which the United States holds easements, thereby damaging the United States,&rdquo; the lawsuit argues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal move comes after Ducey issued an executive order in August directing the state&rsquo;s Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to begin a Yuma County project. The 3,820 feet of the previously open border was closed with 130 shipping containers in just 11 days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project then expanded to other parts of the border, with 6,680 feet of containers stacked two-high throughout Cochise County by early November. That section is estimated to take more than 2,700 shipping containers to fill the 10-mile gap along the southern border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, the state filed its own lawsuit to affirm its right to continue using the shipping containers to help curb unlawful crossings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Our border communities are overwhelmed by illegal activity as a result of the Biden administration&rsquo;s failure to secure the southern border,&rdquo; Ducey said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Arizona is taking action to protest on behalf of our citizens. With this lawsuit, we&rsquo;re pushing back against efforts by federal bureaucrats to reverse the progress we&rsquo;ve made. The safety and security of Arizona and its citizens must not be ignored. Arizona is going to do the job that Joe Biden refuses to do &mdash; secure the border in any way we can. We&rsquo;re not backing down,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit came after Ducey refused to comply with a demand by the Biden administration to remove containers in the Yuma County area. Arizona officials told the Biden administration that the state would not remove the containers until a permanent barrier is constructed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has warned that Ducey&rsquo;s containers have interfered with land near both the Morelos Dam and land belonging to the Cocopah Indian Tribe&rsquo;s West Reservation. It has also argued the barriers interfere with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection&rsquo;s future project to fill holes in the existing wall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, environmental activists have recently targeted Ducey&rsquo;s shipping container project. The Washington Post reported efforts by climate activists to halt the container border wall, including using their bodies to stand in the way of machinery and sitting on containers in protest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ducey leaves office in January, with Democratic Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs set to take over. She is expected to stop any further container wall work along the border.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/sam-brinton-biden-nonbinary-official-hide-student-sex-changes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/sam-brinton-biden-nonbinary-official-hide-student-sex-changes</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonbinary ex-Biden official Sam Brinton helped craft policy to hide student sex changes from parents</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Brinton, the nonbinary ex- Energy Department nuclear waste official facing major prison time, once helped a nonprofit group craft a model school policy adopted in several states that tells schools to hide alleged gender identity or sexual orientation changes from "unaffirming" parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2017 and 2020, Brinton was head of advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, an LGBT group focused on youth suicide prevention, according to Brinton's LinkedIn. In 2019, Brinton played a role in developing a 37-page booklet titled "Model School District Policy on Suicide Prevention," which puts restrictions on how much teachers can talk to parents or guardians if their LGBT child is suicidal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"While parents and guardians need to be informed and actively involved in decisions regarding the student&rsquo;s welfare, the school mental health professional should ensure that the parents&rsquo; actions are in the best interest of the student (e.g., when a student is LGBTQ and living in an unaffirming household)," read the model, which was also published by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the American School Counselor Association, and the National Association of School Psychologists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brinton, 35, was appointed in January as deputy assistant secretary for spent fuel and waste disposition at the Energy Department's Office of Nuclear Energy. The former official was charged with allegedly stealing a suitcase in September worth an estimated $2,325 and, in July, another suitcase in Las Vegas valued at $3,670, according to the DOJ .</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brinton, a biological male who identifies as nonbinary and was the first purported nonbinary person to work as a top Energy Department official, faces up to 15 years in prison. The former official oversaw a $45 million budget and 100 federal government staff members in his short time at the Energy Department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State education departments in Arizona , Idaho, and Virginia have adopted the Trevor Project's model policy in full or partially. In addition, so have school districts in places such as Oregon, California, and New Hampshire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one section of the model, which is titled "Special Considerations," schools are instructed to conceal a child's sexual orientation or alleged gender identity from their parent or guardian unless the student gives consent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When a parent is notified of perceived suicide risk or an attempt, it is essential that the school maintain student confidentiality related to personal information such as sexual orientation or gender identity, especially when the student has not already disclosed to the parent or guardian and does not want it shared," read the model. "Information shared should be restricted to the perceived risk of suicide or facts of the attempt."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrat Rep. Porter says calling person a 'pedophile' brands them a criminal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Democrat Rep. Katie Porter says calling a person a "pedophile" or "groomer" is alleging that they are a criminal because of their "identity."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This allegation of groomer and pedophile, it is alleging that a person is criminal somehow, and engaged in criminal acts merely because of their identity, their sexual orientation and their gender identity," Porter said at Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday titled, "The Rise of Anti-LGBTQI+ Extremism and Violence in the United States."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter also said the "groomer narrative is an age-old lie to position LGBTQ+ people as a threat to kids."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson said at the hearing: "When we use words and phrases like groomers and pedophiles to describe people ... it is dangerous and it's got one purpose. It is to dehumanize us and make it feel like we are not a part of this American society."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter's comments were criticized after the hearing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/universal-basic-income-hits-the-bay-area-if-youre-black/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/universal-basic-income-hits-the-bay-area-if-youre-black/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Basic Income Hits the Bay Area&mdash;If You&rsquo;re Black</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least three guaranteed income initiatives in the San Francisco Bay Area openly discriminate against white residents, limiting or entirely preventing their participation in programs that dole out no-strings-attached cash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programs&mdash;all of which are publicly funded&mdash;violate both the United States and the California state constitution, lawyers say, as well as civil rights laws that ban race discrimination in contracting and by the recipients of government funds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiatives include the Black Economic Equity Movement, which provides $500 a month exclusively to "Black young adults," the Abundant Birth Project, which provides $1,000 a month to "Black and Pacific Islander mothers," and the Guaranteed Income for Transgender People program, which will dole out $1,200 a month and "prioritize enrollment" of transgender "Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC)."&nbsp; They are financed by the National Institutes of Health, the California Department of Social Services, and the city of San Francisco, respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These programs offer a preview of what could soon be the norm in the Golden State. In July 2021, California lawmakers set aside $35 million dollars in grant funding for guaranteed income pilots across the state. Though the law did not include any racial or ethnic qualifiers, in keeping with the California constitution, the state&rsquo;s social services department said that it would only give out the grants to pilots that "center equity." Grant applicants were encouraged to "embed an equity-focused approach throughout each dimension" of their programs, including their "eligibility."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three initiatives appear to violate the 14th Amendment, which bans states from discriminating based on race, said Dan Morenoff, the executive director of the American Civil Rights Project, as well as the California constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which ban racial discrimination in contracting. In addition, the Black Economic Equity Movement appears to violate Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans racial discrimination by the recipients of federal funds. The National Institutes of Health, whose "health equity" initiative funded the program, did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blueprint for these programs comes from private philanthropic ventures, which have experimented with supplemental income schemes in Jackson, Miss., and Atlanta that are only available to black women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though both the Mississippi program, underwritten by the W.K. Kellogg foundation, and the Atlanta program, funded by the Georgia Resilience and Opportunity Fund, discriminate based on race, they probably don&rsquo;t violate any laws, said David Bernstein, a professor of constitutional law at George Mason Law School.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But their California counterparts are another ball game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The publicly funded programs are clearly unconstitutional," Bernstein said. "It&rsquo;s not a close call."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an implicit admission of the legal stakes, every agency involved in the Abundant Birth Project denied using the racial criteria listed on the program&rsquo;s website. The San Francisco Department of Public Health, which oversees the program, told the Washington Free Beacon that it is "open to all San Franciscans," albeit "with focused efforts" to reach black and Pacific Islander "pregnant and parenting people." Jason Montiel, a spokesman for the California Department of Social Services, which in November wrote a $5 million grant to the Abundant Birth Project so it could expand to other parts of the state, said the expansion "will not use race as a basis for eligibility."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That might come as news to Grant Colfax, the director of the San Francisco health department: In a December 6 press release trumpeting the grant, he said it would "help hundreds more Black birthing parents in California." San Francisco mayor London Breed likewise implied that the expansion was racially targeted, calling the Abundant Birth Project "a model to address racial birth disparities."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Economic Equity Movement and the Guaranteed Income for Transgender People program did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech Soccer Player Who Was Benched For Refusing To Kneel During National Anthem Sees Lawsuit Move Forward</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Virginia Tech Hokies soccer player Kiersten Hening now has her opportunity to sue the university after she was allegedly benched for refusing to take a knee as other woke athletes were during the playing of the National Anthem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Thomas T. Cullen gave the approval for the lawsuit to go forward since Hening claimed that her freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment was violated after her coach, Charles Adair, allegedly benched Hening since she refused to join in the team&rsquo;s &ldquo;unity statement&rdquo; of kneeling during the National Anthem during a game in 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hening filed a lawsuit against Virginia Tech and Coach Adair in 2021 but Virginia Tech immediately attempted to file a motion to have the suit tossed. The athlete stated that when she refused to take part in the kneeling, which at the time was a virtue signal statement indicating public support for the Black Lives Matter movement, Adair began to insult and demean her as well as limiting her time to play during matches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge also stated that the facts in this particular case firmly show that the coach singled out Hening specifically because of her political views, not because of her ability as an athlete.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then declared, &ldquo;For these reasons, the court will deny Adair&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, and this matter will proceed to trial.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed raises interest rates half a point to highest level in 15 years</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 15 years, indicating the fight against inflation is not over despite some promising signs lately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping with expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to boost the overnight borrowing rate half a percentage point, taking it to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5%. The increase broke a string of four straight three-quarter point hikes, the most aggressive policy moves since the early 1980s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the increase came an indication that officials expect to keep rates higher through next year, with no reductions until 2024. The expected &ldquo;terminal rate,&rdquo; or point where officials expect to end the rate hikes, was put at 5.1%, according to the FOMC&rsquo;s &ldquo;dot plot&rdquo; of individual members&rsquo; expectations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors initially reacted negatively to the expectation that rates may stay higher for longer, and stocks gave up earlier gains. During a news conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said it was important to keep up the fight against inflation so that the expectation of higher prices does not become entrenched.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases,&rdquo; the chair said at his post-meeting news conference. &ldquo;But it will take substantially more evidence to have confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward&rdquo; path.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new level marks the highest the fed funds rate has been since December 2007, just ahead of the global financial crisis and as the Fed was loosening policy aggressively to combat what would turn into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time around, the Fed is raising rates into what is expected to be a moribund economy in 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members penciled in increases for the funds rate until it hits a median level of 5.1% next year, equivalent to a target range of 5%-5.25. At that point, officials are likely to pause to allow the impact of monetary policy tightening to make its way through the economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consensus then pointed to a full percentage point worth of rate cuts in 2024, taking the funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. That is followed by another percentage point of cuts in 2025 to a rate of 3.1%, before the benchmark settles into a longer-run neutral level of 2.5%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was a fairly wide dispersion in the outlook for future years, indicating that members are uncertain about what is ahead for an economy dealing with the worst inflation it has seen since the early 1980s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newest dot plot featured multiple members seeing rates heading considerably higher than the median point for 2023 and 2024. For 2023, seven of the 19 committee members &ndash; voters and nonvoters included &ndash; saw rates rising above 5.25%. Similarly, there were seven members who saw rates higher than the median 4.1% in 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FOMC policy statement, approved unanimously, was virtually unchanged from November&rsquo;s meeting. Some observers had expected the Fed to alter language that it sees &ldquo;ongoing increases&rdquo; ahead to something less committal, but that phrase remained in the statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed officials believe raising rates helps take money out the economy, reducing demand and ultimately pulling prices lower after inflation spiked to its highest level in more than 40 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After spending much of 2021 dismissing the price increases as &ldquo;transitory,&rdquo; the Fed started raising interest rates in March of this year, first tentatively and then more aggressively, with the previous four increases in 0.75 percentage point increments. Prior to this year, the Fed had not raised rates more than a quarter point at a time in 22 years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed also has been engaged in &ldquo;quantitative tightening,&rdquo; a process in which it is allowing proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off its balance sheet each month rather than reinvesting them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A capped total of $95 billion is being allowed to run off each month, resulting in a $332 billion decline in the balance sheet since early June. The balance sheet now stands at $8.63 trillion.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David DePape case to move forward to trial, judge rules</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David DePape&rsquo;s case will move forward to trial and the alleged Paul Pelosi attacker will be tried on all charges, a San Francisco Superior Court judge ruled on Wednesday. DePape, who appeared in court wearing an orange jumpsuit Wednesday, was arrested on Oct. 28 after allegedly attacking Speaker Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s husband with a hammer inside their Pacific Heights home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superior Court Judge Stephen Murphy just ruled that the San Francisco District Attorney&rsquo;s Office has enough evidence against David DePape to move the case forward to trial on all charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape&rsquo;s defense attorney never disputed that his client was in fact the person who broke into the Pelosi&rsquo;s home and beat Paul Pelosi with a hammer. DePape made a full confession to police during interrogations and video of the interrogation was played in court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most serious charge is premeditated attempted murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defense attorney Adam Lipson tried to argue that the attack was not premeditated, nor attempted murder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defense pointed to DePape&rsquo;s statements to Mr. Pelosi and police, in which he said he was targeting Nancy Pelosi, not Paul Pelosi, and intended to break Nancy&rsquo;s kneecaps &ndash; not kill her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Judge Murphy disagreed with the defense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco Police Department Lt. Carla Hurley said when she interrogated David DePape, he revealed that he had other political targets. DePape said he planned to kidnap Hunter Biden, who lives in Malibu, California, so he could talk to Hunter about &ldquo;all the corruption&rdquo; in Washington, Hurley testified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape said he planned to travel to Los Angeles to confront Biden at home. (As the son of President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden is protected by Secret Service agents at his Malibu mansion.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape also said he planned to target California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Hurley testified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DePape told Hurley that he was on a &ldquo;suicide mission&rdquo; and would do whatever it took to stop Congress&rsquo; &ldquo;corruption and lies.&rdquo; Hurley said, in addition to Newsom and Hunter Biden, DePape also had two more targets:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post announces layoffs in early 2023</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post will be making layoffs early in the coming year, said CEO Fred Ryan on Wednesday morning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to several staffers, Ryan announced at a company town hall that there will be layoffs at the paper early next year, reported Max Tani of Semafor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/v20nj6a-washington-post-announces-layoffs-in-early-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://rumble.com/v20nj6a-washington-post-announces-layoffs-in-early-2023.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As seen on video footage captured by a member of the town hall audience, the crowd became upset at their boss's announcement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What are you going to do to protect people's jobs? Are they going to be treated like the magazine staffers were?" one employee can be heard asking as Ryan began to make his exit while other personnel also attempted to get answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Post ended their Sunday print magazine and laid off its employees, according to the Washingtonian.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of the downsizing comes as the Post faces backlash for the characterization of journalists Bari Weiss and Matt Taibbi as "conservative."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taibbi, who previously worked for Rolling Stone, and Weiss, who was an editor at The New York Times, have both shared many left-leaning views in the past, however, they both are now under fire from the left for their documentation of the "Twitter Files," the internal documents shared by Twitter owner Elon Musk showing the tech giant taking massive steps to suppress and censor conservatives and politically-inconvenient news, such as the Hunter Biden laptop story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a now-edited article, The Post labeled the two as "conservative journalists" for reporting on the &ldquo;Twitter Files,&rdquo; reports the Daily Caller.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedophile spared prison after judge says web chat with 12-year-old girl &lsquo;motivated by boredom&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A British man who engaged in a number of graphic online chats with a girl he believed to be 12 years old has been spared jail time, the Daily Mail reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge presiding over the case argued that the man was "motivated by boredom rather than sexual interest in children" and that his "shame and remorse seem genuine."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Teale, 43, began his chat innocently enough, but the conversation quickly turned sexual, with the married father eventually performing an act over Skype.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won&rsquo;t read exactly what was said, as it is quite graphic in nature&hellip; but I&rsquo;ll just say it was giving me Chris Hanson with to catch a predator vibes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbeknownst to Teale, he was saying all of these things to an undercover police officer, which ultimately resulted in his arrest in January.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He admitted to attempting to engage in sexual activity in the presence of a child and attempting to engage in sexual communications with a child.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge gave him a 12-month suspended jail sentence, meaning that he doesn't have to physically go to prison so long as certain requirements are met, including 150 hours of community service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the sentencing, his previous good character, job loss, as well as the overall impact on his family life were also noted, although these comments were criticized as being an "insult to injury" by a former head of the national online police child protection unit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formerly the Head of Innovation at British investment firm AJ Bell, Teale resigned from his position in July without informing the company of the criminal charges he was facing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teale's lawyer says that he put a stop to his behavior and sought help.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi State football Coach Mike Leach Dies at 61</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Leach, the gruff, pioneering and unfiltered college football coach who helped revolutionize the passing game with the Air Raid offense, has died following complications from a heart condition, Mississippi State said Tuesday. He was 61.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leach, who was in his third season as head coach at Mississippi State, fell ill Sunday at his home in Starkville, Mississippi. He was treated at a local hospital before being airlifted to University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Mike was a giving and attentive husband, father and grandfather. He was able to participate in organ donation at UMMC as a final act of charity,&rdquo; the family said in a statement issued by Mississippi State. &ldquo;We are supported and uplifted by the outpouring of love and prayers from family, friends, Mississippi State University, the hospital staff, and football fans around the world. Thank you for sharing in the joy of our beloved husband and father&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leach fought through a bout with pneumonia late in this season, coughing uncontrollably at times during news conferences, but seemed to be improving, according to those who worked with him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of him falling gravely ill swept through college football the past few days and left many who knew him stunned, hoping and praying for Leach&rsquo;s recovery under grim circumstances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His impact on college football over the last two decades runs deep and will continue for years to come.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leach was known for his pass-happy offenses, wide-ranging interests &mdash; he wrote a book about Native American leader Geronimo, had a passion for pirates, a taught a class about insurgent warfare &mdash; and rambling, off-the-cuff news conferences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leach&rsquo;s teams were consistent winners at programs where success did not come easy. In 21 seasons as a head coach at Texas Tech, Washington State and Mississippi State, Leach went 158-107. And his quarterbacks put up massive passing statistics, running a relatively simple offense called the Air Raid that he did not invent but certainly mastered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interview with Leach was as likely to veer off into politics, wedding planning or hypothetical mascot fights as it was to stick to football. He considered Donald Trump a friend before the billionaire businessman ran for president and then campaigned for him in 2016.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He traveled all over the world and his curiosity knew no bounds. He most appreciated those who stepped outside of their expertise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Leach enjoyed digging into topics other than football, he was excellent at the Xs and Os.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six of the 20 best passing seasons in major college football history were by quarterbacks who played for Leach, including four of the top six.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling plays from a folded piece of paper smaller than an index card, Leach turned passers such as B.J. Symons (448.7 yards per game), Graham Harrell (438.8), Connor Halliday (430.3) and Anthony Gordon (429.2) into record-setters and Heisman Trophy contenders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I covered this one due to Mike Leach&rsquo;s time at WSU, where he spent 8 successful seasons at the helm of my father&rsquo;s alma mater. We shared great memories watching his cougars together. Rest in peace Leach, rest in peace.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>One from the archives. Many people get bent out of shape when they see &lsquo;Xmas&rsquo; or &lsquo;X-Mas.&rsquo; They think it&rsquo;s a way of removing Jesus Christ from Christmas. Every year you see the signs and the bumper stickers saying, "Put Christ back into Christmas" as a response to this substitution of the letter X for the name of Christ. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/lawmakers-unveil-bipartisan-bill-that-aims-to-ban-tiktok-in-the-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/lawmakers-unveil-bipartisan-bill-that-aims-to-ban-tiktok-in-the-us.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers unveil bipartisan bill that aims to ban TikTok in the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new bill from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, if passed, would ban TikTok in the U.S. after years of broad concern across the Trump and Biden administrations about potential Chinese government influence on the company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media stocks including Meta and Snap were positive Tuesday when the news broke. Meta shares were up more than 6% and Snap was up more than 3% as of late morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has raised fears in the U.S. that Chinese government officials could gain access to U.S. user data under Chinese law that could compel the company to hand over information. TikTok has insisted U.S. user data is safely stored outside of China, which it says should keep it out of reach of government officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the company&rsquo;s reassurances have done little to turn down the heat on TikTok. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. is in talks with the company about how to resolve some of the data concerns, though a solution has reportedly been delayed. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before Congress recently that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;extremely concerned&rdquo; about the Chinese government&rsquo;s potential influence through TikTok on U.S. users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bill, introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Reps. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., and Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., would ban &ldquo;all transactions from any social media company in, or under the influence of, China, Russia, and several other foreign countries of concern,&rdquo; according to a press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ANTI-SOCIAL CCP ACT &mdash; which stands for Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party &mdash; explicitly names ByteDance and TikTok as subject to the restrictions in the bill, &ldquo;unless and until the date on which the President certifies to Congress that the company no longer meets any of the conditions described,&rdquo; such as being subject to &ldquo;substantial influence&rdquo; by a country of concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is troubling that rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically-motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States,&rdquo; a TikTok spokesperson said. &ldquo;We will continue to brief members of Congress on the plans that have been developed under the oversight of our country&rsquo;s top national security agencies&mdash;plans that we are well underway in implementing&mdash;to further secure our platform in the United States.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis to investigate Covid vaccine-related injuries</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Tuesday morning roundtable with health regarding Covid-19 mRNA vaccine accountability, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he will be petitioning for a statewide grand jury to investigate "any and all wrongdoing in Florida with respect to Covid-19 vaccines."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1602711034921619461"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1602711034921619461</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking in regards to the information that came about during the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, where people were told to stay inside but George Floyd protestors were allowed to congregate in large groups, DeSantis announced a "panel of experts" who will "counteract nonsense when it&rsquo;s coming out of these institutions" like the CDC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of the CDC!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/cdc-mask-tripledemic/2022/12/12/id/1100143/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/cdc-mask-tripledemic/2022/12/12/id/1100143/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC Urging Return to Masks Amid 'Tripledemic'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention again is urging people to wear masks indoors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for encouraging mask use is what health officials are calling a "tripledemic:" the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC's Dec. 8 report said that 13.7% of Americans live in communities rated "high" for COVID-19 community levels, up from 4.9% the previous week, The Hill reported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional 38.1% of Americans are in "medium" areas and 48.2% are in "low" areas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"[We] encourage you to wear a high quality, well-fitting mask to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, most especially for those in the 5% of the population currently living in counties with high COVID-19 community level," Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week during a conference call.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"CDC continues to recommend masking for anyone choosing to travel by plane, train, bus, or other form of public transportation, or for anyone who may be immunocompromised or increased risk of severe disease."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hill reported that several major cities are mulling a return to masking mandates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 10 counties in California fall under the "high" areas.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles County health officials are recommending that everyone wear masks indoors. Hospitals in LA saw an average of 1,245 COVID-positive patients every day &mdash; a nearly 20% jump from previous week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When you put on your mask for these few weeks during this surge, it is about the people of LA County. It is about every individual, every visitor, our health care workers, essential workers and other people who serve. In addition to vaccination, it is one of the easiest things everyone can do right now,&rdquo; Barbara Ferrer, Los Angeles County director of public health, wrote in a Dec. 9 press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York, state officials urged schools to return to indoor masking to curb the spread of respiratory illnesses, and a health advisory notice alerted hospitals, local health departments, emergency rooms and labs to prepare for rapidly rising cases of respiratory illness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do they want you to mask up, but they&rsquo;re coming for our guns too!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/states-tighten-second-amendment-rules-as-scotus-lifts-restrictions_4915179.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theepochtimes.com/states-tighten-second-amendment-rules-as-scotus-lifts-restrictions_4915179.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=BonginoReport</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Tighten Second Amendment Rules as SCOTUS Lifts Restrictions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a list of pro-gun rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court over the past 13 years, Rev. Mark Knutson of Portland, Oregon, who has been advocating against gun access, gives one reason for his support of stricter firearms laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This will save lives,&rdquo; says Knutson, a pastor at Augustana Lutheran Church and chairman of the &ldquo;Lift Every Voice Oregon&mdash;YES on Measure 114&rdquo; campaign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knutson was the chief petitioner of the campaign in support of Oregon Measure 114, which narrowly passed in the midterm election in November. He described the campaign as &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; and said it was in response to the recent shootings in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a well-funded campaign based on reports filed with the Oregon Secretary of State&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;Lift Every Voice Oregon&rdquo; spent just shy of $2.4 million.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top three contributors to the campaign were Connie Ballmer of Bellevue, Washington, who contributed $750,000. Ballmer is an Oregon native and married to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Together, they have started several organizations to support charitable and political causes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Education Association, a teacher&rsquo;s union, contributed $500,000, and the 1630 Fund contributed $250,000. The 1630 Fund is described by the website Influencewatch.org as a possible &ldquo;dark money&rdquo; fund that supports progressive causes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the fund, Knutson pointed out that, as a 501c4, it is not required to disclose its donors. He said the fund was set up to help progressive political campaigns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Oregon, Measure 114 requires Oregonians apply for a permit to purchase firearms, along with background checks and certification from the purchaser for passing an approved safety course. The law also requires the state police to compile a firearms database, and prohibits the sale of magazines that can hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, is involved in a Second Amendment battle on the opposite side of the country. He denies that safety is motivating New York state officials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about intimidation,&rdquo; King said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His organization sued New York state over its previous requirement that concealed weapons permit applicants show &ldquo;proper cause,&rdquo; or in other words, a legitimate reason for applying for a concealed firearm permit. According to King, the law was to disarm the populace while making exceptions for the wealthy and politically connected. The original case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court this year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court decided last June that the proper cause requirement was unconstitutional. The court also held that Second Amendment regulations must align with constitutional text and history. In other words, since the Constitution did not mention &ldquo;proper cause&rdquo; and historically this had not been required, the state could not require it either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost immediately, Gov. Kathy Hochul called the legislature into session to pass the Concealed Carry Improvement Act. The act removed mention of &ldquo;proper cause&rdquo; but expanded all other requirements. An applicant&rsquo;s social media will be scrutinized, and must provide contact information for a list of close family and friends. The CCIA also requires 16 hours of training, including two hours of training on a firing range.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the new law expanded the government&rsquo;s list of &ldquo;sensitive places&rdquo; where it sought to prohibit the carrying of firearms. This includes private property unless the property owner posts a sign granting permission or has given express permission to the permit holder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-Second Amendment groups, including Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, sued the state and a judge found several elements of the new law unconstitutional. However, that judge&rsquo;s ruling is on hold as state officials vow to continue the fight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armored Republic</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand bans cigarettes for all those born after 2009</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiwis born after 2009 will not be able to purchase legal cigarettes, according to a new law by Jacinda Ardern's Labour party that seeks to make the country smoke-free.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law would grandfather tobacco use to those born before January 1 of 2009, reports the Daily Mail. This would mean that 50 years from now, one would have to be 63 or older to buy cigarettes in New Zealand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health authorities are aiming to make the country smoke-free by 2025.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law will also reduce the number of retailers who can sell tobacco by 90 percent, which would leave just 600 stores.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand's associate minister of health said that the legislation seeks to ban cigarettes from use, saying that "There is no good reason to allow a product to be sold that kills half the people that use it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"And I can tell you that we will end this in the future, as we pass this legislation," she continued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Zealand health system hopes that billions of dollars will be saved by cutting smoking, as it causes cancer, increases blood pressure, strokes, and causes a variety of other diseases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers voted to pass the legislation 76 to 43.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand's right-wing ACT party, which voted against the bill, said that corner stores would go out of business without cigarettes to sell.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics New Zealand has found that 8 percent of New Zealand adults smoked daily, down from 16 percent a decade ago. 8.3 percent of adults vape daily, an increase of 1 percent from six years ago. Indigenous Maori populations smoke more than the average New Zealander, with around one-fifth reporting that they smoke.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s the news for today&hellip; but before I end today&rsquo;s newsbrief&hellip; I want to stop and take a moment to talk about someone who is likely very dear to some of you&hellip; Mike Lawyer&hellip; Just before I came to do this newsbrief, I received a church email that announced that Dr. Lawyer, had passed away, and has gone to glory, to be with his wife Eileen, and with our creator, whom with no doubt is saying, well done, my good and faithful servant. Dr. Lawyer was a faithful counselor to many in the Moscow community, but also to many around the world, who would always ask the question, &ldquo;where is God in all this?&rdquo; To me&hellip; Mike was more than just a counselor&hellip; he was a dear friend, and a father figure. He came into my life during a dark time, and God used him as a tool to reshape me in Christ&rsquo;s image. Mike, all I can say is I love you, and my heart aches at your passing. But I am comforted to know that you are in glory with our creator and Eileen.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-worker-productivity-tanked-year-what-gives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-worker-productivity-tanked-year-what-gives</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US worker productivity has tanked this year. What gives?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American workers aren't getting nearly as much done this year as they used to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. labor productivity plunged first quarter in the largest decline since 1947, then dropped by the highest annual amount on record in the second according to the Bureau of Labor Statics. The third quarter data indicates year-over-year output saw three consecutive declines for the first time since 1982.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is going on? One expert says there are several factors contributing to the drop in productivity, and the problem is likely to persist for some time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Bauke, founder and chief career strategist with The Bauke Group, told FOX Business the decline in output from the current workforce was largely inevitable &ndash; COVID just sped it up. In short, she says, "The world of work right now is a mess."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. workforce is stretched thin in this tight labor market &ndash; and people are just plain burnt out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, Bauke noted, the pandemic caused many older, seasoned workers to retire early, and the spots left behind by those "boomers" are being filled by an insufficient number of less-experienced workers from younger generations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do Gen X and Gen Z workers lack some of the institutional knowledge as older workers, Bauke says, but they are also less willing to put in the long hours their boomer managers might expect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the older workers that remain now tend to be less willing to sacrifice their health or family time to take on loads of extra work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the problem, month upon month of persistent talent shortages means workers are being asked to do more than just their own job because employers have been unable to fill many open positions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With recession fears growing, the problem is getting even worse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bauke says the first thing companies do when they are looking at cutting back their workforce is to cancel open positions, and "What message does that send to the people back at work who have been doing two jobs? It says the cavalry is not coming."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She argues companies have been pushing their employees to the point that the workers don't care anymore. But, with fewer positions open and a recession looming, workers are scared to leave their jobs out of fear that they would be the first to be laid off if they took a new position elsewhere.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/household-wealth-down-by-13-5-trillion-in-2022-second-worst-destruction-on-record-11670623787?siteid=bullytweet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/household-wealth-down-by-13-5-trillion-in-2022-second-worst-destruction-on-record-11670623787?siteid=bullytweet</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Household wealth dropped by $13.5 trillion from January to September, second-worst destruction on record</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American households lost about $6.8 trillion in wealth over the first three quarters of 2022 as the stock market shed more than 25% of its value, the Federal Reserve reported Friday in the government&rsquo;s quarterly financial accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nominal net worth fell 4.6% to $143.3 trillion, as the market value of assets fell by $6 trillion and liabilities rose by about $900 billion. Households&rsquo; balance sheets -assets minus liabilities&mdash;were propped up by a 10% increase in home equity, which is the greatest source of wealth for most American families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the loss in real wealth from January through September was about twice as large as the nominal loss &mdash; $13.5 trillion in current dollars&mdash;after accounting for the rapid inflation experienced this year. Inflation makes both debts and liabilities worth less in terms of purchasing power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 8.6% drop in real wealth over three quarters is the second-fastest decline on record (the data series begins in 1959). The only greater drop was following the financial crisis of 2008-09. (The wealth lost during the Great Depression of the 1930s would likely hold the record if we had the data.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after adjusting for inflation, real household wealth was about 10% higher than it was in late 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Household balance sheets&mdash;in the aggregate&mdash;remained in excellent shape despite the losses on Wall Street and the erosion of purchasing power. Wealth as a share of annual disposable (after-tax) personal income slipped slightly to 769%, not far off the record 825% in the first quarter of the year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At $18.8 trillion, liabilities were just 103% of annual disposable incomes, far below the peak of 136% seen in 2008, just as that housing bubble burst. In real terms, liabilities are lower today than they were back then, despite the much larger economy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners, in particular, were in good shape financially as September ended, with the equity in their houses rising to a near-record 70.5% of market value from a record low of 46% in 2012. But if home prices continue to fall as they have done in the past several months, homeowners without much exposure to the stock market will begin to feel poorer. What will happen to home prices as mortgage rates rise is a major unknown facing policy makers and homeowners alike.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warning signs are also flashing as household debt has awakened, like Rip Van Winkle, after a 10-year nap. Following a decade of no growth in debt in inflation-adjusted terms, real household debt grew at a 4.3% annual rate in the third quarter, the fastest growth since 2007.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disgraced Loudon County school superintendent indicted for cover-up in student rape case inquiry</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documents unsealed on Monday have revealed that a special grand jury in Loudon County, Virginia has indicted former superintendent of schools Scott Ziegler for his role in the handling of student sexual assault cases in the county's schools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to LoudonNow, the jury has issued four indictments against two Loudon County Public Schools officials, with the indictments being unsealed on Monday by a county judge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler has been indicted on one count of false publication, one count of prohibited conduct, and one count of penalizing an employee for a court appearance, all of which are misdemeanors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Information Officer Wayde Byard was indicted on one count of felony perjury, which reportedly carries a maximum sentence of up to 12 months in jail and a fine of up to $2,500.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special grand jury, which was assembled in April by the Office of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to investigate the handling of two sexual assaults carried out by the same student at two separate schools in 2021, released their report last week regarding the investigation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler was fired the following day during a closed-door meeting with the Loudon County School Board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their report, the jury stated that "we believe that throughout this ordeal LCPS administrators were looking out for their own interests instead of the best interests of LCPS."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 28, 2021, a girl was sexually assaulted in the women's bathroom at Stone Bridge High School by a male student. This student was temporarily detained in July of 2021, but was released and transferred to another school within the district. Then on October 6, another sexual assault by that same student took place at Broad Run High School.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We believe that throughout this ordeal LCPS administrators were looking out for their own interests instead of the best interests of LCPS. This invariably led to a stunning lack of openness, transparency, and accountability both to the public and the special grand jury. There were several decision points for senior LCPS administrators, up to and including the superintendent, to be transparent and step in and alter the sequence of events leading up to the October 6, 2021 BRHS sexual assault. They failed at every juncture," the report said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Idaho Settles Christian Students&rsquo; Lawsuit</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Christian students and a faculty member have settled a lawsuit against the University of Idaho that acted to limit their freedom of religious speech.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit, filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) attorneys in April, blamed university officials for targeting the students&rsquo; First Amendment rights by punishing them for their religious speech. The university had issued no-contact orders on students&mdash;Peter Perlot, Mark Miller, and Ryan Alexander, who are members of the university&rsquo;s Christian Legal Society (CLS) chapter&mdash;as well as CLS faculty advisor Professor Richard Seamon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the settlement, the university rescinded the no-contact orders and agreed to pay $90,000. Following the settlement, CLS attorney Laura Nammo criticized university officials for censoring differing viewpoints as it &ldquo;needlessly exacerbates polarization and harms all students&rsquo; ability to learn from one another,&rdquo; according to ADF Media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s university students will be tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders, judges, and school administrators, so it&rsquo;s imperative that university officials model the First Amendment freedoms they are supposed to be teaching their students,&rdquo; said ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conflict which triggered the lawsuit occurred during spring. The University&rsquo;s College of Law held a public event on the campus in Moscow, Idaho, to condemn an anti-LGBTQ slur that was found on a whiteboard at the Boise campus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event was attended by members of the CLS who also prayed publicly. The members follow a code that classified non-heterosexual marriage as immoral. One university student, referred to as Ms. Doe in court documents, questioned the presence of CLS at the event, pointing to the group&rsquo;s stance on LGBTQ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorneys representing CLS students claim that they had responded respectfully, presenting their beliefs as per their Biblical interpretation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But lawyers representing the university claimed that a CLS member would keep on insisting LGBTQ students will go to the &ldquo;gallows of hell&rdquo; if they fail to &ldquo;repent for their sins,&rdquo; according to AP. Seamon is accused of having reinforced such statements. This caused Ms. Doe to be in tears, the university says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Doe is then said to have received a note from another CLS member on her desk, asking for a discussion on the matter so that both sides can understand each other&rsquo;s views.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She later complained to officials that the contact made her feel harassed and uncomfortable, asking that no-contact orders against everyone, including herself, be issued so that she can feel safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a panel with the American Bar Association, several people publicly denounced CLS&rsquo; religious beliefs. One of the CLS students who attended the meeting claimed that it was his organization and its beliefs that faced the greatest amount of discrimination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When no-contact orders were issued against CLS students, they were given no opportunity to defend themselves or review the allegations leveled against them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CLS members eventually sued the University. In July, a federal judge asked the university to rescind the orders, pointing out that Ms. Doe has not alleged any sexual harassment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge also noted that CLS students would likely succeed in arguing that the university was suppressing their First Amendment rights.</span></p>
