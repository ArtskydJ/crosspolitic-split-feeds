<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/putin-turkey-grain-deal/2023/09/04/id/1133111/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/putin-turkey-grain-deal/2023/09/04/id/1133111/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Putin Won't Renew Grain Deal Until the West Meets His Demands</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that a landmark deal allowing Ukraine to export grain safely through the Black Sea amid the war won&rsquo;t be restored until the West meets Moscow's demands on its own agricultural exports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed the Kremlin&rsquo;s demands as a ploy to advance its own interests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Still, Putin's remarks dashed hopes that his talks with the Turkish President could revive an agreement seen as vital for global food supplies, especially in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russia refused to extend the deal in July, complaining that a parallel agreement promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertilizer hadn&rsquo;t been honored. It said restrictions on shipping and insurance hampered its agricultural trade, though it has shipped record amounts of wheat since last year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Putin reiterated those complaints Monday, while also telling reporters that if those commitments were honored, Russia could return to the deal &ldquo;within days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Turkish President also expressed hope that a breakthrough could come soon. He said Turkey and the U.N. &mdash; which both brokered the original deal &mdash; have put together a new package of proposals to unblock the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;I believe that we will reach a solution that will meet the expectations in a short time,&rdquo; Erdogan said at the news conference held with Putin in the Russian resort of Sochi.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Earlier, a German Foreign Minister lashed out, saying Putin's &ldquo;game with the grain agreement is cynical.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A lot is riding on the negotiation. Ukraine and Russia are major suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other goods that developing nations rely on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Data from the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, which organized shipments under the deal, show that 57% of the grain from Ukraine went to developing nations, with the top destination being China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Grain prices shot up after Russia pulled out of the deal but have since fallen back, indicating that there isn't a big crunch in the market for the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">But failure to revive the agreement will have &ldquo;drastic impacts&rdquo; in countries such as Somalia and Egypt that rely heavily on Black Sea grain, according to Galip Dalay, an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Russia may be hoping it can use its power over Ukraine&rsquo;s Black Sea exports as a bargaining chip to reduce Western economic sanctions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/04/university-michigan-students-hotel-rooms-covid-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/04/university-michigan-students-hotel-rooms-covid-19/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Major University will Kick Students out of Dorms if they Gev Covid-19</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The University of Michigan (UM) is asking students who test positive for COVID-19 to get a hotel room in order to quarantine for five days, according to the university&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The university reminded students on Sept. 1 of the school&rsquo;s rules surrounding COVID-19, suggesting if they are sick stay home, wear masks and get tested, according to the website. The university also asked students to create an &ldquo;isolation plan&rdquo; in case they contract COVID-19, noting that no students are allowed in the residence halls if they test positive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;This could include relocating to your permanent residence, staying with a nearby relative or friend, or finding a hotel space. Students in Michigan Housing must leave their residence halls during isolation, even if they are in a single room,&rdquo; the website reads.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The UM Department of Environment, Health &amp; Safety (EHS) is supposed to get in touch with the students within 24 hours to discuss the &ldquo;care and isolation options,&rdquo; according to the website. If a student must pay for a hotel room, the university did not clarify on the website whether or not they will compensate the student.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/05/oil-prices-mixed-on-receding-support-from-chinas-steps-to-recovery.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/05/oil-prices-mixed-on-receding-support-from-chinas-steps-to-recovery.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Oil prices settle at 10-month high as Saudi, Russia extend supply cuts</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Oil prices rose a dollar a barrel on Tuesday to their highest since November, after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year, worrying investors about potential shortages during peak winter demand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Brent crude futures rose by $1.04, or 1.2%, to settle at $90.04 a barrel, closing above the $90 mark for the first time since November 16, 2022. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October futures gained $1.14, or 1.3%, to settle at $86.69 a barrel, also a 10-month high.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Investors had expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend voluntary cuts into October, but the three-month extension was unexpected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would review the supply cuts monthly, and could modify them depending on market conditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;With the production cut extended, we anticipate a market deficit of more than 1.5 million barrels per day in 4Q23,&rdquo; UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo wrote in a note to clients. UBS now expects Brent crude to rise to $95 a barrel by year-end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Reflecting concerns about the short-term market supply, front month Brent and WTI contracts were also trading at their steepest premium since November to later-dated prices. This structure, called backwardation, indicates tightening supply for prompt deliveries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Also supporting oil prices on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it now sees the probability of a U.S. recession starting in the next 12 months at 15%, down from an earlier forecast of 20%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Along with the Saudi supply cuts, which began in July, prospects of the U.S. economy avoiding a hard recession have helped lift oil demand and prices in recent months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Both Brent and WTI futures have gained more than 20% since the end of June.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In other news&hellip; have you guys been noticing Mcconell lately and his freezing episodes?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/mcconnell-physician-says-no-evidence-seizures-stroke-second-freezing-episode"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/mcconnell-physician-says-no-evidence-seizures-stroke-second-freezing-episode</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>McConnell physician says &lsquo;no evidence&rsquo; of seizures or stroke after second freezing episode</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The attending physician of the Capitol is ruling out a seizure, stroke, or other movement disorder after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) had difficulty speaking during a press conference in Kentucky last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;My examination of you following your August 30, 2023 brief episode included several medical evaluations: brain MRI imaging, EEG study and consultations with several neurologists for a comprehensive neurology assessment,&rdquo; Dr. Brian P. Monahan said in a new letter released by McConnell's office. &ldquo;There is no evidence that you have a seizure disorder or that you experienced a stroke, TIA or movement disorder such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The incident occurred last Wednesday when a reporter in Covington, Kentucky, asked him about his political plans when his term is up in 2026.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At first, the Senate Republican leader acknowledged the question but trailed off and stopped speaking. An aide stepped in and asked if he had heard the question. McConnell responded "yes" but continued to freeze. This prompted the aide to say, "We're going to need a minute."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The senator appeared to regain his composure and then briefly answered two additional questions after aides stepped in to repeat questions from reporters and then led him away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In late July, the minority leader was briefly escorted from the Senate Republicans' weekly press conference after he froze in front of the cameras, the first such public incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">McConnell, 81, was hospitalized earlier this year after suffering a fall that required him to complete physical therapy. He experienced a concussion and a minor rib fracture that sidelined him from the Senate for nearly six weeks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Monahan last week attributed the most recent freezing episode to dehydration and lightheadedness related to his concussion but said he was "medically clear" to continue his duties as usual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The Republican leader's office also had attributed the two freezing moments to &ldquo;lightheadedness."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">McConnell was previously hospitalized in 2019 after fracturing his shoulder from a fall on his patio at home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">McConnell and the rest of the Senate returns to Washington Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>]]></description>

   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Neighbor!&nbsp; Welcome to the kitchen table of the Comedian Next Door, hosted by the Fight Laugh Feast Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to solve the Cone Palace Problem.&nbsp; Since this is a community-wide issue with far-reaching consequences, you already know exactly what we're talking about: There's constantly gridlocked traffic at the corner of US31 and Center Road, caused by Kokomo's inexplicable craving for mediocre icecream from 4:00pm to 9:00pm DAILY... It's awful. Let's whine about it.</p>
<p>Next, celebrate Luke's special accomplishment with us!</p>
<p>Later... People have no idea how to stay married the "lust phase."&nbsp; Let's dissect a meme that often gets shared by Divorced People to justify their 3rd or 4th or 5th new relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact the Comedian Next Door by emailing <a href="mailto:nextdoor@johnbranyan.com">nextdoor@johnbranyan.com</a>. We'll see you at the Conference in October! (Details at flfnetwork.com)</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Just how deep a dive is possible when it comes to Tolkien and metaphysics? About as deep as Thomas Acquinas goes, according the New Saint Andrews Fellow, Jonathan McIntosh. In this free ranging discussion the Pugs dive into the creation story of the Silmarillion, the nature of power and language, G. K. Chesterton, and dozens of other things.

   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Just how deep a dive is possible when it comes to Tolkien and metaphysics? About as deep as Thomas Acquinas goes, according the New Saint Andrews Fellow, Jonathan McIntosh. In this free ranging discussion the Pugs dive into the creation story of the Silmarillion, the nature of power and language, G. K. Chesterton, and dozens of other things. Tolkien nerds will now be able to nerd out in a whole new way!</p>

<p><strong>America Last: Biden Admin Pledges Mass Campaign To Give Work Permits To Migrants</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration committed to working with the state of New York on Wednesday to help fill job vacancies with migrants who are straining the city&rsquo;s social safety net, according to a press release.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul asked the Biden administration on Aug. 24 to expedite work permits for immigrants who are flooding New York City, provide more funds to build shelters and reimburse the state for the cost of deploying National Guard troops in response to the migrant crisis. Senior Biden administration officials met with Hochul on Wednesday, pledging to launch a campaign that will help migrants within the state apply for employment authorization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;First, following the deployment of a Department of Homeland Security assessment team, the Administration highlighted data indicating that substantial number of recent migrants who arrived in New York City are currently work eligible but have not yet applied to get a work permit,&rdquo; the press release states. &ldquo;For example, nationwide, only around 16% of working-age CBP One entrants have applied for work authorization. To date, roughly 20% of the noncitizens indicating New York, New Jersey or Pennsylvania as their intended destination this year were paroled in following an appointment scheduled through CBP One and are eligible to work immediately, if they apply.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration and the New York state government will use text messages and email beginning in September to provide migrants who are &ldquo;work eligible&rdquo; with information on how to apply for employment authorization, the press release states. New York will also receive support from the federal departments of Health and Human Services, Education, Housing and Urban Development and the Interior to assist with the migrant surge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Republican governors began busing migrants to New York City, the state has had to care for about 100,000 migrants, despite not having enough shelter and resources. The Biden administration was previously apprehensive about allowing Democrat-run cities to grant migrants work permits, fearing that the move could lead to more border crossings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders previously requested that the Biden administration temporarily waive the 180-day required waiting period before migrants can receive work authorization.</span></p>

<p><strong>Parental Rights Win as Mom Settles With School District That 'Transitioned' Daughter Without Consent</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transgender mob has made no bones about exactly what their agenda is, and they are quick to brand anyone who speaks out about it a bigot or a transphobe. Much of their indoctrination is taking place in the nation's public schools. They love to claim that they are just helping kids to be their "true selves" or some such nonsense. But if what they are doing is so great, why don't they feel the need to involve parents, or in many cases, even tell them? One California mom fought back against the trans agenda, and the case could be a landmark victory for the rights of parents of public school children all over the country.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Konen's 11-year-old daughter, Alicia, is a student in the Spreckels Union School District in Monterey County, California. Alicia was told at school that she might be "upset" because "she didn't know who she 'truly was inside.'" Was she displaying signs of being "upset," such as failing grades or acting out in class? How did the school conclude she was upset about anything? The school then began socially transitioning Alicia's gender. She was allowed to use the boys' restroom and use male pronouns. All of this going on without Konen's knowledge or consent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jessica Konen found out about this, she sued the school district. Konen was represented by the Center for American Liberty and obtained a settlement from the school district for $100,000. Thankfully, Jessica Konen's daughter continues to be her daughter. But Konen says the fight is far from over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the school district settled with Konen, they did not admit any fault. It would have been surprising if they had.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spreckels Union School District is just one of several school districts in liberal Democrat-run California where parents have had enough of being told they have no say in their children's education.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping parents out of the gender loop is a problem that is not going away. Roughly 168 school districts overseeing 5,904 schools around the nation have guidance that prevents parents from knowing if their child identifies as a gender other than their birth gender at school. Faculty and staff cannot disclose this information without the student's permission. These numbers shake out to approximately 3.2 million public school students.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Argentine Presidential Front-Runner Javier Milei: Biden a &lsquo;Threat to Western Values&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argentina&rsquo;s presidential front-runner Javier Milei described socialists as &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; and &ldquo;human excrement&rdquo; during a radio interview, to which Colombia&rsquo;s far-left President Gustavo Petro, a former member of a Marxist guerrilla group, responded Tuesday by comparing Milei to Adolf Hitler.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petro, a former member of the Marxist M19 guerrilla and Colombia&rsquo;s first-ever leftist president, made the outrageous comparison on his Twitter account hours after Colombia&rsquo;s RCN radio published an exclusive interview with Milei on Tuesday. During the interview, Milei suggested socialism was the greatest threat to his country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What is a socialist on the inside? He is garbage, he is human excrement,&rdquo; Milei railed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere in the interview, Milei listed leftist values as &ldquo;envy, hatred, resentment, unequal treatment before the law, theft and murder&rdquo; and branded American President Joe Biden a &ldquo;threat to Western values.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Biden is a left-wing president,&rdquo; Milei said. &ldquo;So it is not surprising that he is also putting the world&rsquo;s leading power in check. Biden himself is a threat to Western values.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milei&rsquo;s remarks garnered condemnation from Petro.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is what Hitler said,&rdquo; Petro wrote. Milei has not publicly responded to Petro&rsquo;s comparison as of press time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milei, a lawmaker and anti-establishment presidential candidate for the (&ldquo;Liberty Advances&rdquo;) coalition, is known for his outspoken and no-holds-barred contempt for communism, denouncing it as a &ldquo;murderous system&rdquo; and socialism as a &ldquo;disease of the soul.&rdquo; Milei is a far-right candidate who describes himself as libertarian and anarcho-capitalist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milei emerged as the most voted candidate in Argentina&rsquo;s Open Primary election process this month, leading to October&rsquo;s general election, with roughly 30 percent of the votes. During the open primary, all individuals who wish to be presidential candidates appear on the ballot; those who receive over 1.5 percent of the vote appear formally on the official ballot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milei continued his explanation by giving his hypothesis on the expansion of leftism in Latin America following the fall of the Berlin Wall, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the rise of the Sao Paulo Forum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;After the fall of the Berlin Wall, here in 1989 the Sao Paulo Forum was set up and the intention of the Sao Paulo Forum was to create the Latin American Soviet Union,&rdquo; Milei said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is a very concrete plan, there are three parts. In the first part, 90 percent of the battle is cultural and 10 percent is how to obtain resources,&rdquo; Milei continued his explanation. &ldquo;The second stage is 50 percent cultural and 50 percent advancing in regulation and attacking companies. Perhaps the last part is the expropriation part.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sao Paulo Forum is a coalition of Latin American and Caribbean leftist governments and political parties established in 1990 by the Brazilian Worker&rsquo;s Party (PT) &mdash; a political party founded by Brazil&rsquo;s radical leftist President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva. The Forum was established to help leftists in Latin America coordinate messaging, ideology, and policy execution across the region.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;What is, deep down, a socialist? He is garbage, he is human excrement, [someone] who basically, because he does not want to support the brilliance of another human being, is willing for everyone to be in misery,&rdquo; Milei asserted. &ldquo;To be a socialist, deep down, is a sickness of the spirit, a sickness of the soul. They are bad people, that is the reality.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The values of socialism are envy, hate, resentment, unequal treatment before the law, theft, and murder,&rdquo; he asserted.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO RELEASED OF NEBRASKA TE ARIK GILBERT AFTER BREAKING INTO VAPE SHOP, STEALING $1.6K IN PRODUCTS</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for my favorite topic, sports!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska tight end Arik Gilbert is in a world of trouble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert, 21, was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of burglary after breaking into SJ&rsquo;s Liquor and Vape Shop in Lincoln. Gilbert allegedly stole $1,672 worth of products, including cigars and vapes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities booked Gilbert at Lancaster County Jail. Bond was set at $5,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A security video circulating on social media shows a shirtless Gilbert, hiding behind a makeshift mask&nbsp; made from his shirt, using cement from the store&rsquo;s parking lot to break through the initial glass door. Once inside, Gilbert attempts to kick down another door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert joined LSU in 2020 before leaving for Georgia ahead of his second year. The former top TE prospect posted 35 catches for 368 yards and two touchdowns in eight games with LSU.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert also flirted with going to Florida before joining the Bulldogs. Buried in Georgia&rsquo;s offense, Gilbert transferred to Nebraska this offseason but awaits eligibility from the NCAA for his second transfer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule reacted to news of the arrest, as relayed by KETV7, and spoke on the ongoing struggles for Gilbert this offseason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rhule said in a press conference: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to help him through some of the issues he&rsquo;s dealing with in his life, have been really proud of the job he had done in the spring and summer. But to be honest, during camp, he said he&rsquo;s had some struggles, he&rsquo;s working overcome them.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-idalia-landfall-florida-big-bend-category-3-tens-thousands-without-power"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-idalia-landfall-florida-big-bend-category-3-tens-thousands-without-power</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Hurricane Idalia makes landfall over Florida's Big Bend as a Category 3, hundreds of thousands without power</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Hurricane Idalia made landfall over Florida&rsquo;s Gulf Coast as a "catastrophic" Category 3 storm Wednesday at 7:45 a.m., leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power, officials said. It has since been downgraded to a Category 1 storm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Idalia produced storm surges that reached several feet in some areas and brought damaging winds that howled up to 130 miles per hour at one point, according to the National Hurricane Center. It also caused flooding that completely encompassed Floridian roadways when it passed the Apalachee Bay and made landfall over Florida's Big Bend region, where the peninsula merges into the Panhandle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he had directed law enforcement to "protect people's property.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"We are not going to tolerate any looting in the aftermath of a natural disaster. I mean it's just ridiculous that you would try to do something like that on the heels of an almost Category 4 hurricane hitting this community," DeSantis said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">He warned would-be looters that they could very well be walking into the home of a Second Amendment advocate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"I've seen signs in people's yards, and I would say it's probably here, &lsquo;You Loot, We Shoot.&rsquo; You never know what's behind that door," DeSantis said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Biden said he had spoken with the governors of states most impacted by the storm and vowed all federal assistance, including 1,500 personnel and 900 Coast Guard personnel throughout the southeast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">"Federal teams on the ground are going to continue to work with the first responders in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, to get people to safety," Biden said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">At least two people have died in vehicle accidents since the storm made landfall, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. In Pasco County, a 40-year-old male lost control of his Ford Ranger and collided into a tree after driving too fast for the weather conditions, while a 59-year-old male died in Alachua County after his Toyota Tacoma plunged into a ditch and crashed into a nearby tree line, officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The storm has been impacting Gainesville, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Dowling Park, Lake City, Cedar Key, Chiefland, Newberry, Cross City, Apalachicola, and Perry. Its impact will also be felt in Orlando, Spring Hill, Bradenton, Bartow, Ocala, Lake Placid, Tampa, Sarasota, and Fort Myers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">By 11 a.m. Wednesday, the storm was a Category 1, with sustained winds of 90 mph, and its impact was being felt in Georgia, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Authorities continue to urge caution as, despite the slight decline, the storm remains dangerous and potentially life-threatening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">More than 340,000 Americans were without power as Idalia continued to blast Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolina, according to Fox Weather.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Further outages are expected as the storm continues pummeling the state as Idalia continues its northeast path to Georgia, the Carolinas and then the Atlantic Ocean.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The National Weather Service in Tallahassee had called Idalia "an unprecedented event" as it rapidly intensified over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and obtained Category 4 status within 24 hours. It downgraded slightly, officially becoming a high-end Category 3 storm when it made landfall, before downgrading again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The NWS also said "no one" has witnessed a storm strengthen to such magnitude in such a short time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/08/30/trump-raises-more-than-20-million-in-august-n574661#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/08/30/trump-raises-more-than-20-million-in-august-n574661#google_vignette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Trump raises more than $20 million in August</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Donald Trump has raised $20M in August, according to his campaign. Since he was processed in the Fulton County jail and had a mugshot taken, he has raised more than $9.4M.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite the multiple indictments and the first-ever presidential mugshot, his contributors continue to send in campaign contributions. The campaign knew the mugshot would be a money-maker and fundraising came swiftly as soon as it was released. The angry scowl seen around the world is marketed on various merchandise on Trump&rsquo;s website. Trump haters are buying up merchandise on other sites and displaying their purchases on social media like it is a badge of honor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;Since the moment my mugshot was plastered all over the Internet in a vicious attempt to wrongfully turn me into a criminal, our movement has RAISED $9 MILLION from grassroots patriots like YOU,&rdquo; Trump said in a statement released by the Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;In fact, our campaign recorded its SINGLE GREATEST FUNDRAISING DAY EVER,&rdquo; the 77-year-old said of his Georgia surrender bounty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">His fundraising numbers spiked once the mugshot was released &ndash; which it immediately was &ndash; with supporters particularly pleased with the &ldquo;never surrender&rdquo; slogan. Critics noted the irony since the mugshot was taken when he surrendered to authorities to be processed at the jail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The merchandise sales are impressive so far. The totals reported include 36,000 T-shirts, 24,000 coffee mugs and 8,600 posters. One thing that people talk about is the amount of money Trump is spending on legal bills and how a lot of those bills are being paid by campaign donations. It&rsquo;s being reported that the mugshot merchandise money is being earmarked by the campaign for political and campaign activities and won&rsquo;t be used to cover legal expense. Trump has spent tens of millions of dollars on legal bills since the season of indictments began. Altogether, Trump is facing 91 counts in all four indictments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Trump raised $5M in the first 48 hours after the indictment in Manhattan and $10M over five days. After the indictment over the mishandling of classified documents, his campaign said it raised $6.6M. Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said that last Friday was the biggest fundraising day for the Trump campaign so far, with $4.18M raised on the day alone. Trump&rsquo;s mugshot was taken on Thursday night.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>Chicago TV news reporter on assignment to cover thefts robbed of video camera at gunpoint</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A pair of Chicago journalists were held up at gunpoint by three men wearing ski masks &mdash; while covering the spate of robberies and carjackings that plagued the Windy City over the weekend, according to local police and news outlets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">A Univision Chicago reporter and a cameraman were set to do a live shot in the upscale Wicker Park section at around 4:30 a.m. on Monday when a black SUV and a gray sedan pulled up alongside them, according to the news site CWBChicago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The two male journalists &mdash; one 28 and the other 42 &mdash; were standing near the 1200 block of North Milwaukee Ave. when &ldquo;three unknown male offenders exited the vehicles, wearing ski masks and displaying firearms,&rdquo; Chicago police officials told The Post on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The thugs made off with their video camera before fleeing, cops said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">No injuries were reported and none of the suspects were in custody as of Tuesday afternoon, police said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The brazen attack was part of a spree that involved at least 30 others who were either robbed or carjacked in the crime-ravaged city on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, according to local authorities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Luis Godinez, the vice president of Univision Chicago, circulated an email to employees confirming that their colleagues were the ones who were robbed, according to the news site Block Club Chicago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">The fact that the news personnel were now part of the story is &ldquo;total irony,&rdquo; the Univision reporter, who wished to remain anonymous, told the site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">&ldquo;As a journalist, you never want to be the story, right?&rdquo; the reporter told Block Club Chicago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Earlier this month, a Chicago TV news videographer had two of his phones robbed while preparing to cover a news conference on the city&rsquo;s West Side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Law enforcement officials have yet to make arrests in those cases, according to reports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><a href="https://beckernews.com/99-of-fatalities-in-united-states-not-primarily-caused-by-covid-19-cdc-data-51670/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://beckernews.com/99-of-fatalities-in-united-states-not-primarily-caused-by-covid-19-cdc-data-51670/</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;"><strong>99% of Fatalities in United States Not Primarily Caused by Covid-19: CDC Data</strong></span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite the rampant fear being spread in the U.S. media about new Covid subvariants, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Infection cast doubt on any cause for alarm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">CDC statistics reveal that only 1% of all weekly deaths across the United States are attributed to Covid-19. For the week ending on August 19, the CDC&rsquo;s Covid dashboard reports 324 Covid-related fatalities, constituting a mere 1.7% of all deaths during that period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Although the percentage of deaths due to Covid for the week ending August 19 reflects a minor uptick from the prior week, it is substantially lower than the pandemic&rsquo;s apex, when the CDC cited Covid as the cause of nearly one in three deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Data highlights that states such as Washington, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina, Maryland, and New York are experiencing higher rates of Covid-induced deaths. Maryland and Florida lead with 3.4%, while Washington, Tennessee, North Carolina, and New York are around the 2% mark. In contrast, more than 24 states recorded between one and nine Covid-related deaths for the week ending August 19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Additional data points out that the fatality rate is marginally higher among women than men, and is most elevated among individuals aged 75 and older.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">This latest data may offer some comfort at a time when anxieties are escalating across the country due to the spread of highly transmissible new Covid variants, resulting in an increase in infections and hospitalizations, as well as the reintroduction of certain Covid mandates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Recently detected variants like EG.5 (Eris) and BA.8.26 (Pirola) have emerged in multiple countries, including the United States. These variants have undergone extensive mutations, making them potentially more adept at dodging vaccine and natural immunity, and contributing to a rise in infections.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Despite the appearance of these variants, infections in the U.S. have doubled and hospital admissions have risen for the fifth consecutive week, but they remain near historical lows. Importantly, Covid-related deaths have not surged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Last week&rsquo;s concerns over a Covid resurgence led Hollywood&rsquo;s Lionsgate studio to enforce mask mandates at its Santa Monica, California offices. This decision was later rescinded within days. Similarly, Rutgers University in New Jersey and Morris Brown College in Georgia both declared that face coverings will be mandatory for faculty and students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Medical facilities like Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Santa Rosa, California, and Upstate Community Hospital in Syracuse, New York, have reinstated mask requirements for healthcare workers, patients, and visitors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">In Kentucky, the Lee County School District shut down classes less than two weeks after reopening, as nearly 20% of its student body fell ill with a &lsquo;tripledemic&rsquo; of illnesses, including Covid, strep throat, and influenza.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">President Biden indicated on Friday that his administration will &ldquo;likely&rdquo; recommend another Covid booster vaccine soon. He also signed a proposal asking Congress for additional funds to modify Covid vaccines to better counteract the new variants. Nevertheless, public interest in booster shots remains tepid, with only 18% of eligible Americans having received any form of booster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">As pointed out by the Mayo Clinic, about 81% of Covid-related deaths in the United States have been in people age 65 and older, adding that &ldquo;risks are even higher for older people when they have other health conditions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;">Even when accounting for the difficulty in assessing cause of death in a predominately elderly population with comorbidities, the Covid-19 pandemic nonetheless had a 99.7% survival rate in the United States.</span></p>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DeSantis expands Florida's state of emergency as Hurricane Idalia to make landfall Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded a state of emergency to include more counties as the southern U.S. braces for Hurricane Idalia to make landfall Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 33 of Florida's 67 counties were under the previous executive order, DeSantis' updated order issued Monday now includes 46 counties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service said Tuesday that Idalia is "expected to rapidly intensify into an extremely dangerous major hurricane" before making landfall.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis said Monday that Idalia is expected to develop into at least a category 3 hurricane by the time it makes landfall, according to CBS News.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service states that with a category 3 hurricane, "devastating damage will occur," and things such as utilities, trees and well-built homes may incur major damages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for Idalia's landfall, DeSantis fully activated the Florida National Guard, and 5,500 are expected to be mobilized to respond to the storm. Additionally, dozens of public schools have closed down and the state government is taking additional steps to ensure people have access to food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden posted Monday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that he spoke with DeSantis "to inform him that we've approved the Emergency Declaration for Florida as they prepare for Hurricane Idalia," and he said, "Florida has my full support as they prepare for Idalia and its aftermath."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/kyle-rittenhouse-sued-by-estate-of-the-child-molester-he-blew-away-in-self-defense"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.theblaze.com/news/kyle-rittenhouse-sued-by-estate-of-the-child-molester-he-blew-away-in-self-defense</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Rittenhouse sued by estate of the convicted child molester he blew away in self-defense</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Rittenhouse shot three attackers who mobbed him during a leftist riot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020. Two of the three are no more. He was cleared of all charges in 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being found not guilty by a jury of his peers, Rittenhouse has since had to fight various efforts to paint him as a villain and to punish him for defending himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent attempt comes in the form of a civil lawsuit filed by the convicted child molester Joseph Rosenbaum's estate Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Scorecard reported that the suit names Rittenhouse as a defendant along with local sheriff's departments, Kenosha officials, the City of Kenosha, the City of West Allis, and various counties, demanding "compensatory and punitive damages" for the "wrongful death" of Rosenbaum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post noted that Rosenbaum spent most of his adult life in prison after preying upon five preteen boys.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears his life on the outside was marked by rage and rootlessness. For instance, one month prior to his demise, Rosenbaum's fianc&eacute;e, Kariann Swart, pressed charges against him for domestic abuse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just hours before catching four bullets, the homeless and bipolar 36-year-old had been released from a hospital following a suicide attempt, reported NPR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh out of the hospital, Rosenbaum joined in the destructive riots that kicked off in response to the non-fatal police shooting of Jacob Blake, whom state prosecutors indicated had been wanted on a felony warrant and was armed with a knife.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rittenhouse's lawyers claimed during his murder trial that Rosenbaum attempted to "engage" the youth, at which point Rittenhouse attempted to flee. Rosenbaum gave chase, threw a sack of belongings at him, then, according to witness testimony, attempted to disarm the then-17-year-old by force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footage of the incident shows that it was only when the 17-year-old appeared cornered in a car lot did he open fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to claiming Rosenbaum was a peaceful protester who "was not a danger to himself or others," the Rosenbaum estate cast Rittenhouse in the lawsuit as a menace who "fired his assault rifle indiscriminately multiple times," despite the 17-year-old's documented restraint and sure aim.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Rosenbaum can be seen on film chasing down the boy, the suit alleges that "there was no justification for Defendant Rittenhouse to point his weapon at Joseph Rosenbaum."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/federal-judge-dismisses-university-wyoming-students-lawsuit-trans-sorority-member"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.foxnews.com/media/federal-judge-dismisses-university-wyoming-students-lawsuit-trans-sorority-member</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Federal judge dismisses University of Wyoming students' lawsuit against trans sorority member</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Wyoming sorority members&rsquo; lawsuit for the inclusion of a transgender student in their organization was dismissed by a federal judge on Friday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, several current and former members of the University of Wyoming&rsquo;s Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority sued the national sorority to revoke the membership allowing what they described as "peeping" transgender student Artemis Langford. Despite the women&rsquo;s descriptions of Langford&rsquo;s alleged actions, the judge ruled that the school did not violate any policies by allowing the student to join.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The University of Wyoming chapter voted to admit - and, more broadly, a sorority of hundreds of thousands approved - Langford. With its inquiry beginning and ending there, the Court will not define &lsquo;woman&rsquo; today. The delegate of a private, voluntary organization interpreted &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, otherwise undefined in the nonprofit's bylaws, expansively; this Judge may not invade Kappa Kappa Gamma's freedom of expressive association and inject the circumscribed definition Plaintiffs urge," the judge said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling continued, "Holding that Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege their derivative, breach of contract, tortious interference, and direct claims, the Court dismisses, without prejudice, Plaintiffs' causes of action."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit brought by seven members of Kappa Kappa Gamma claimed that Langford violated sorority policies by joining a sorority despite not being a woman or making efforts to appear female.</span></p>

<p><strong>Biden Seeks Long-Term Military Aid to Ukraine to Prevent Next President From Scaling Back Funding</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration is seeking to hammer out a long-term Ukraine aid agreement with European allies in hopes of both preventing Russia from gaining an edge on the battlefield and hamstringing a future president&rsquo;s ability to scale back U.S. commitments, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scheme emerged during sideline talks among Group of Seven leaders at a NATO summit in July, and so far involves negotiations between the U.S. and Ukraine, and between the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ukraine, according to the WSJ. It&rsquo;s an attempt, in part, to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin he can simply wait until a new American administration, as several top GOP political contenders have expressed intention to reduce or eliminate U.S. aid that makes up the brunt of Western support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building up Kyiv&rsquo;s defense forces in the long term can theoretically deter Russia from invading again, officials calculated, according to the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump has maintained a lead in Republican primary candidate polling and could face a second showdown with President Joe Biden in the 2024 election. Trump has claimed he could solve the war &ldquo;within 24 hours.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the first Republican primary debate Wednesday, several candidates indicated they would support drawing down aid for Ukraine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighteen countries not belonging to the G-7 wealthy democracies, including the Netherlands and Sweden, have also agreed to the long-term security assistance pledge for Ukraine, according to the WSJ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European capitals want to cement support and restrict ways countries could renege on pledges, fearing what might happen during a second Trump administration, according to the WSJ. At present, Western European nations lack the industrial and financial capacity to match the billions in annual military aid provided by the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has devoted more than $40 billion worth of weapons and equipment, as well as training and investment into U.S. weapons companies, for the purpose of aiding Ukraine&rsquo;s resistance. The aid has exposed weaknesses in American military readiness and industrial base capacity, provoking criticism that the U.S. should be using those funds to shore up defenses with an eye toward China as the war in Ukraine drags on with no end in sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the practical workings of the agreement pose significant hurdles to the Biden administration&rsquo;s goals, the WSJ reported, citing officials. A sitting president has limited ability to bind his successor to any initiative or policy.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>UNC-Chapel Hill faculty member killed in shooting that sent campus into lockdown</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill faculty member was killed Monday in a shooting that prompted a campuswide lockdown while officials searched for an "armed and dangerous person," university officials said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A suspect was captured about an hour and a half after the shooting at Caudill Laboratories, and an all-clear alert was issued for the campus about two hours after that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No other injuries were reported, schools officials said at a briefing Monday afternoon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am devastated and saddened by today&rsquo;s shooting in one of our campus buildings, a place where we conduct our important work of teaching, mentoring and research every day," UNC Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz said in a letter to the university community. "This shooting damages the trust and safety that we so often take for granted on our campus. We will work to rebuild that trust and safety."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university first alerted students of an armed and dangerous person on or near campus shortly after 1 p.m.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 2:24 p.m., the university issued an alert to remain sheltered in place because a suspect was at large. Video from campus showed a large police presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When campus police released a photo of a person of interest at 2:35 p.m., they warned, "If you see this person, keep your distance, put your safety first and call 911."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school said at 3:14 p.m. that all classes and events were canceled Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement that officials "are taking precautions to protect campus safety following today&rsquo;s shooting."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is a tragic way to start a new semester and the state will provide any assistance necessary to support the UNC community,&rdquo; Cooper said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one with the university was immediately reached Monday afternoon for additional comment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials with the FBI in Charlotte said the federal agency is assisting local law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-trumps-dc-trial-date-set-for-march-4-one-day-before-super-tuesday?utm_campaign=64487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-trumps-dc-trial-date-set-for-march-4-one-day-before-super-tuesday?utm_campaign=64487</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trump's DC trial date set for March 4&mdash;one day before Super Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DC federal Judge Tanya Chutkan has set March 4, 2024 as the trial date for Trump's case over the aftermath of the 2020 election. This is the day before Super Tuesday, when 14 states, including California and Texas, head to the polls to determine the GOP nominee for president.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case, brought by special counsel Jack Smith, alleges that Trump engaged in conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct and official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Trump's trial in Manhattan, brought by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, is set to start March 25, 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In setting the date, Chutkan reportedly spoke to the New York judge who is overseeing the "falsified business documents" case in New York.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Setting a trial date does not depend and should not depend on a defendant's personal obligations," Chutkan said, comparing Trump's campaign obligations to those of a professional athlete, whose schedule would also not be considered when setting trial dates in a criminal case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 12.8 million pages of discovery have been given by the DOJ to Trump's defense. Special counsel prosecutor Molly Gaston said that "at this point, discovery is now substantially complete."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's attorneys are likely to file many motions in the coming weeks, and John Lauro, representing the president, said that Trump is essentially being prosecuted for "being President Trump." Lauro is reportedly preparing a motion to dismiss the entire case over selective prosecution, saying "it provides an advantage to these prosecutors' boss who's running a campaign against President Trump."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has asserted his belief that the 4 cases currently against him, two from Biden's DOJ and one each in Georgia and New York, constitute election interference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Trump was impeached the first time, it was on the basis of election interference. Congress alleged that Trump encouraging an investigation by Ukraine into Joe Biden's influence on the judicial system while he was VP, more than a year prior to the US presidential election of 2020, constituted election interference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House said that Tump "acting both directly and through his agents within and outside the United States Government&mdash;corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into&mdash; a political opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the Biden administration is ordering these public trials, and that is not being characterized as election interference. Just weeks before the first indictment, Biden officials reportedly met with Jack Smith. This despite Biden continuously saying that the DOJ is independent.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mask study published by NIH suggests N95 Covid masks may expose wearers to dangerous level of toxic compounds linked to seizures and cancer</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgical N95 mask has been held up as the gold standard when it comes to protecting against Covid.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a study quietly re-shared by the National Institutes of Health in spring suggests the tight-fitting mask may expose users to dangerous levels of toxic chemicals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers from Jeonbuk National University in South Korea looked at two types of disposable medical-grade masks, as well as several reusable cotton masks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that the chemicals released by these masks had eight times the recommended safety limit of toxic volatile organic compounds (TVOCs).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inhaling TVOCs has been linked to health issues like headaches and nausea, while prolonged and repeated has been linked to organ damage and even cancer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">'It is clear that particular attention must be paid to the VOCs associated with the use of KF94 [medical] masks their effects on human health,' the researchers wrote in the study published April.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are ways to reduce the danger, they said. 'Exposure can be significantly reduced if a mask is opened and left to sit for at least 30 min,' the researchers wrote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This suggests that the packaging of these masks could play a role in the amount of chemicals they have.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TVOCs are a large group of odorous chemicals, many of which are released by cleaning and beauty products, burning fuel and cooking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest study, researchers tested 14 disposable and cloth masks purchased online by measuring the amount of TVOCs in them. The disposable masks were KFAD and KF94 models, which were made from thermoplastics polypropylene and polyurethane nylon.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These masks have been popularized in South Korea, where the study was conducted, whereas KN95s are more popular in the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, their differences are miniscule. KFADs and KF94s filter 94 percent of particles, while KN95s filter 95 percent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources of TVOCs in the home include aerosol sprays, cleansers and disinfectants, moth repellents, air fresheners and automotive products.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other sources include building materials and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, permanent markers, correction fluids, carbonless copy paper and craft materials including glues and adhesives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research carried out by the Cochrane Institute, for example, suggested that face masks made 'little to no difference' in Covid infections and deaths.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers said harms caused by masks - including hampering children's schooling - were poorly measured in the studies, meaning any small benefit on infection rates may be outweighed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a controversial study suggested that wearing face masks raises the risk of stillbirths, testicular dysfunction, and cognitive decline in children.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tucker Carlson in Negotiations to Interview Putin</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news has the left-wing media up in arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news was first announced by the Russian state-owned media outlet Russia Today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan said on Sunday that Tucker Carlson has been seeking an interview with Putin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlson has yet to comment on the news.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putin is known to shy away from one-on-one interviews with foreign media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news was broke by Kanekoa The Great on X: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1695898131781853682"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1695898131781853682</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last interview Putin did of this type with a Western journalist was an interview with CNBC anchor Hadley Gamble on the sidelines of the Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow in October 2021.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, President Donald Trump&rsquo;s interview with Carlson was viewed 261 Million times, according to the view counter displayed on Twitter.</span></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Bohnet Music Academy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&rsquo;t it about time to take action on how you're going to give your children and grandchildren a good music education? Moses, David, and all the Saints of the church have worshiped God with musical might, so let&rsquo;s be confidently found doing the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohnet Music Academy instructs children and adults in how to be musically literate. That&rsquo;s everything you need to know and do as the musician God made you to be. Lessons are available locally in Moscow, ID and online. What&rsquo;s great is that in addition to getting vocal training, you can also study the piano, guitar, violin, cello, drums, or the trumpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Trump supporters, counter-protesters clash outside of Fulton County jail ahead of his arrival</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, both supporters and opponents of 2024 GOP frontrunner Donald Trump gathered outside the Fulton County jail in expectation of his arrival to surrender to authorities in the 2020 election case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the afternoon, police had blocked off the road leading up to the jail, as a crowd gathered at the end of the road.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One person was seen standing with a "Donald J Trump did nothing wrong sign," while others flew American flags and wore red MAGA hats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One anti-Trump man wearing a black and white striped jail suit blasted a bullhorn alarm into the ear of a Trump supporter. Three more behind him were dressed as rats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday morning, Trump replaced his lead Georgia lawyer with Steve Sadow, who last represented Atlanta rapper Gunna in the YSL RICO case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump and 18 codefendants have been charged with violation of the Georgia RICO Act, solicitation of violation of oath by public officer, false statements and writings, impersonating a public officer, conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, forgery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit false statements and writings, criminal attempt to commit filing false documents, conspiracy to commit filing false documents, criminal attempt to commit influencing witnesses, influencing witnesses, conspiracy to commit election fraud, conspiracy to commit computer theft, conspiracy to commit computer trespass, conspiracy to commit computer invasion of privacy, conspiracy to defraud the state, and perjury.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying with Trump&hellip;</span></p>

<p><strong>Trump Claims Debate Victory, and He Has Some Incredible Numbers to Support the Claim</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican debate was Wednesday night, and some were somewhat disappointed that the debate didn't spend time on the economy, how horrible Joe Biden is, and the weaponization of the government against political opponents and the American people. It seems like the candidates spent more time trying to verbally take on Vivek Ramaswamy than Joe Biden. It was clear that they were concerned about Ramaswamy's numbers when the rest were mainly in single digits,. They were hoping to have that springboard moment off of him. But it seemed that only focused more attention on him, rather than on them. "Vivek" was trending this morning on polls running this morning like the Drudge poll had him polling as the winner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here was perhaps one of the funniest moments of the debate when Ramaswamy came back at Chris Christie</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1694525968021647466"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1694525968021647466</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I think the problem for the folks at the debate was the guy Fox referred to as the "elephant not in the room" --- President Donald Trump. In the Fox debate format, you don't get the chance to expound on your thoughts. You're given a very limited time to make an impression, sometimes in the. midst of being shouted down or attacked by another candidate. Meanwhile, as we reported, Trump was free to speak at length and benefitted from the long-form interview format.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here was a hilarious moment where he eviscerated the abilities of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and speculated that other folks might come forward in the primary because those two were so bad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1694527574955761965"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/i/status/1694527574955761965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Play Video&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that I found commendable in the Trump interview was that even in the face of four indictments, what was Trump talking about? The concerns about China's movements in our hemisphere, trying to build bases in Cuba, and their influence over the Panama Canal. There was precious little foreign policy in the GOP debate apart from asking about continued funding for Ukraine, which most seemed to be okay with and Ramaswamy wanted to stop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a strategic understanding that we've seen from Trump in the past for example in trying to warn Germany and NATO about being beholden to Russia for their oil. It's something that Biden completely fails at because he doesn't seem at all concerned about America's security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did any of the candidates at the GOP debate have that springboard moment to shake up the polls and move past Trump? I don't think so. There might be some minor jockeying around, but they faced an almost impossible task to begin with, with Trump so far ahead. How do you gain on him if he isn't even there?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's team released a statement after the debate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"President Trump won this evening's Republican debate in dominating fashion," said the statement attributed to Trump campaign senior adviser Susie Wiles. "More people watched President Trump's interview with Tucker Carlson than the rest of the field on the debate stage combined. Tonight, voters saw a clear contrast between President Trump engaging in a thoughtful policy discussion about what his second term will look like versus 90-second canned sound bites and platitudes from the debate stage."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiles' statement continued: "What is clear after the dust settles: none of the other candidates looked ready to take on Crooked Joe Biden. Only one leader can Make America Great Again, and that's President Donald J. Trump."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this juncture, if winning is determined by attention and eyes on you, then Trump has some receipts for the claim. According to the view count, it's almost 200 million views -- 195+ million at this juncture, after not even a full day.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Maui Survivors on Instructions from Government During Fire: &ldquo;Only Those Who Disobeyed Survived&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents in West Maui faced a barricade that blocked the only paved exit out of town when they attempted to escape the raging wildfires, according to the Associated Press, forcing them to evade the authorities&rsquo; obstacles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents encountered a gridlock caused by several Hawaiian Electric trucks that were replacing telephone poles along the road to Highway 30, and received instructions from electricians to turn back into Lahaina, AP reported. Some died in their cars while others swerved around the barricade or used dirt roads to escape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It made no sense what they were doing,&rdquo; Cole Millington, a resident, said, according to NBC News. &ldquo;They could see the sky was black. They could see the city was on fire. They could see the wind was still whipping everything around. But they were already starting to plant new power poles.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many residents could not escape the traffic and abandoned their cars to jump in the Pacific, making the gridlock even worse, according to The Washington Post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The gridlock would have left us there when the firestorm came,&rdquo; Kim Cuevas-Reyes, a resident who drove into the wrong lane to escape, said, according to AP. &ldquo;I would have had to tell my children to jump into the ocean as well and be boiled alive by the flames or we would have just died from smoke inhalation and roasted in the car.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wildfires have burned approximately 2,170 acres in Lahaina, according to CBS News. There have been at least 115 deaths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaiian Electric did not immediately respond to requests for a comment.</span></p>

<p><strong>US Approves New $500M Arms Sale to Taiwan as Aggression from China Intensifies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has approved a $500 million arms sale to Taiwan as it ramps up military assistance to the island despite fervent objections from China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Department said Wednesday it had signed off on the sale of infrared search tracking systems along with related equipment for advanced F-16 fighter jets. The sale includes the infrared systems as well as test support and equipment, computer software and spare parts, it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the deal is modest in comparison to previous weapons sales, the move is likely to draw fierce criticism from Beijing, which regards self-governing Taiwan as a renegade province and refuses to rule out the use of force to reunify it with the mainland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient&rsquo;s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,&rdquo; the State Department said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The proposed sale will improve the recipient&rsquo;s capability to meet current and future threats by contributing to the recipient&rsquo;s abilities to defend its airspace, provide regional security, and increase interoperability with the United States through its F-16 program," it said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement came just hours after Taiwan&rsquo;s President Tsai Ing-wen renewed a pledge to strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s self-defense as she visited a war memorial from the last time Taiwan and China battled. Tsai, visited the outlying islands of Kinmen where the conflict was fought 65 years ago, commemorated those who died.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday's State Department announcement also follows an angry Chinese reaction to the transit through the United States of Taiwanese Vice President William Lai on his way to and from an official visit in Paraguay last week.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, China has stepped up its military activity in the waters and skies around Taiwan, sending fighter jets and navy vessels near the island or to encircle it.</span></p>]]></description>

   <title><![CDATA[Identity Politics & Original Sin: An Interview with Dr. Joshua Mitchell [The Pugcast]]]></title>
   <link/>
   <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today the Pugs are joined by political philosopher, Dr. Joshua Mitchell of Georgetown University. Dr. Mitchell is the author of American Awakening: Identity Politics and Other Afflictions of Our Time. Unlike many thinkers who blame cultural marxism for the slide of the Left into identity politics, Dr. Mitchell believes the true source of the problem is a Christian heresy. The Left has turned doctrines like sin and atonement into a framework for a political program of purgation. Certain groups are scapegoated in the interest of cleaning the stain of social sins such as racism. The problem, of course, is this doesn't truly atone for anything. Our only hope for atonement is found in Christianity. Without a revival of genuine Christian faith the American experiment will end in failure.</p>
